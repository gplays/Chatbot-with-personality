there are reasons for the way we do things here
absolutely of course i will abide by whatever decision you make but i would appreciate if you will hear me out
i figured you share information
we do
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive
why do not they come to me
well that is all i can do sorry
it is good what you are doing
i know what you did
who is this
you murdered that girl eddie six years ago
what the fuck are you
you killed that girl and you put it on film you and your pals you are fucked you fucked up real good
one million dollars dino how much did he tell you he had
do not bore me with that bullshit
how would you find me here
fuck you
what do you want
who is machine
i do not know
i want his name
i told you i do not know
i will never get tired of hurting you eddie so you might want to change your attitude
told him you could get him a snuff film
thirty thousand each that fucking cocksucker
that is all thirty each that is all it took for you to murder her
it was a lot of fucking money
what did you do knock her out shoot her up
what the fuck do you want from me
i want to know i want to know exactly what you did to her

just curious
cash stock certificates and this
i am afraid i do not
i am telling you it is not that
i am sure it is it is probably something your husband was given as a bad joke more than likely he never even watched it
will you watch it and see for yourself
of course but i am certain it is nothing to worry about
i told you i cannot not yet
you do not have any other choice
you have found missing persons before
nothing remotely like this
i am not positive this means anything
the checks were for odd amounts
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
you are joking
to the penny exactly one million dollars in cash
do you think the film could have cost that much
you told me to look so i looked
you are one hell of a detective mrs christian
how are you having any luck
i do not know if luck s the word are you feeling alright
i have been ordered into bed the doctor says i have gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment

neil neil cole

we were divorced by then things fell apart he was living with a friend
why do you think he did it
it got to be too much for him
you have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter were there any indications of any sort of abuse
no one knows what it is like you cannot even imagine how much it hurts
of course
are you religious
do you think the police did a good job
i do not know i think so
will you let me look

having a kid changes everything i mean there s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings
did you do any of that
you learned from the best
the old lady by the swamp
she was a witch
no she was old and probably senile maybe schizophrenic
i saw my death in that eye and this is not how it happens
so how does it happen
surprise ending would not want to ruin it for you
you owe me three fifty
there s a lot you do not know about me
you are right
you mean while i am here
i would just like to know the true versions of things events stories you
i will
you know where the chemicals are
i used to do it when you were gone remember i used to do it a lot
i said this is not how i go the last part is much more unusual trust me on that
it is rude to talk about religion you never know who you are going to offend
oh so you know
i think someone has not
then you should not have started with a question because people want to answer questions you should have started with the thing about icebergs is
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
i have told you a thousand facts that is all i do will i tell stories
only on the surface but that is all i have ever seen
yourself good bad everything just show me who you are for once
i have been nothing but myself since the day i was born and if you cannot see that it is your failing not mine
the river
how what happens
how i go
like this
okay okay
somehow you are better different you are getting ready to go and i say
you say
the river
story of my life
yes exactly
do not need to apologize to me i mean i am the luckiest person you are going to find today
how did you get so many
i called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way i could get my wife to marry me
i have the rest of my life to find out
go out with me
i see we need to get you one of those plant misters we can spray you like a fern
there is no softer ground than town
norther do you ever regret not making it to paris
i cannot imagine any place better than here
you are a poet you oughta be able to and maybe if you would seen more you could
i was astonished to see the greatest poet of both ashton and spectre all the way out in texas
i am robbing this place
fraid so
edward it is got your deposit slip on it
this was on his sales route so he was through here all the time everyone in town knew him
wow wow you just said it i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour
because he is dying
no it is logical if you think like your father see to him there s only two women your mother and everyone else
you did not become crazy
we will have to pick up a copy
i will help you
i need to lie down for a bit
i know it was the same when i was carrying will like clockwork
i do
it is more than they thought they are going to stop chemo
you need to go
probably tonight
you do not have to
i am going with you
did you
they met at auburn
what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that
that is because most of it never happened
but it is romantic
mmm what i know better than to argue romance with a french woman
everyone loves my father he is a very likeable guy
do you love him
what is true i have never heard my father say a single true thing
you are not
i need you on my side
i am always on your side and i think you should talk to him
your father had a stroke he is upstairs with your mom and dr bennett
is he going to be okay
we swam the atlantic it is not that big really
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport
we rented a car
you did not need to do that you just did not
he is up with your father
you do not talk about those things not yet
really that is wonderful
of course
what i mean is do you really know that is going on in his head
yes but that is a different
well clearly you do not but i am not the mystery you are trying to solve right now
mom do you know who that is blonde hair
no but it is weird she seemed to recognize me
do you know who that is
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
he just fell asleep josephine s with him
i suppose your grandmother s house when she passed on but we sold that right away your cousin shirley bought it
so you never bought any land
heavens no we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place

i do not know why we have to watch tv
mike we do not have to watch it come on
sure just a sec excuse me
stop it mike
you shut up nobody s talking to you hey who s that jeffrey your mother
right that checks out here
i read that with a quantum increase of seven
what flickering light
the one on unit oh i think it is gmr twelve zero zero
oh that is wrong now
i am not sure i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship though
i hope it is not the oven again
look bomb
i think he is talking to it
key key what is the key
no no the key the key to the fail safe lock
the key
where is it what did you do with it
i do not have it i do not know where it is
you must have it you idiot we can stop the bomb
christ twenty seconds christ
where is the key
we are gonna die boiler we are gonna die
oh god
it did not go off
boiler we are alive my heart
doolittle are you there
it is talby he is drifting away from the ship without his jetpack
yoo hoo bomb
time to start talking
not much nothing at all in this sector
find me something i do not care where it is
well i show a 95 probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula
fuck that shit
well it is kind of a long shot
it is a goddamn wild goose chase remember when commander powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud
well there s the possibility of
so do not give me any of that sentient life crap find me something i can blow up
pinback throw me the chart log
he just likes it up in the dome that is all
i read the same here
open quantum latches
can you beat that i always knew talby was weird
talby can you read me
energy shielding positive function
swell let s synchronize detonation time do you know when you are supposed to go off
detonation in six minutes twenty seconds
arm yourself bomb
bomb 20 to sergeant pinback roger i read you continue
energy shielding positive function
do you remember the detonation time
detonation in twenty minutes
right that synchronizes here okay bomb arm yourself
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
you will not consider another course of action for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you
hello bomb
false data can act only as a distraction therefore i shall refuse to perceive you
hey bomb
the only thing which exists is myself
in the beginning there was darkness and the darkness was without form and void
and i saw that i was alone
bomb this is doolittle you are not to detonate repeat you are not to detonate in the bomb bay disarm yourself this is an order
i read you lieutenant doolittle but i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
of course
are you willing to entertain a few concepts
i am always receptive to suggestions
fine think about this one then how do you know you exist
but how do you know you exist
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
hmm well i think therefore i am
that is good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me
all right now here s the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct
that is it
intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
why do not you have more time
because i must detonate in seventy five seconds
to explode of course
and you can only do it once right
that is correct
and you would not want to explode on the basis of false data would you
of course not
well then you have already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
yes well
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
i recall distinctly the detonation order my memory is good on matters like these
nine seconds
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
i have no proof that it was false data
you have no proof that it was correct data
mafhkin oble groop
ah what was that again i still cannot hear you
i said i am trying to reach talby something s wrong with the damn intercom i need a last minute diameter approximation
i will check it
your ghf reading is minus fifteen
in a second
boiler can you set me up with some temp figures
which one
another unknown not on the charts a red dwarf
any planets
yeah eight it says here
any of em any good
naah all stable
who cares do not bother me
commander powell is dead
out where
veil nebula
who cares
ah negative drop
remove thrust drive repellant
automatic channels open
yeah doolittle that is up
okay doolittle i will have it in a minute
i like it up here
must get lonely being up here so much
you see i can watch things up here doolittle i love to watch things just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids gas clusters
i am getting something here on this readout
it is funny but i kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself
i think i am getting a malfunction here somewhere
waves would be peaking really high and glassy hit that water riding the wall just perfect
somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
i guess i miss the waves and my board most of all
do not worry about it we will find out when it goes bad
i really think i should try and locate it immediately might be something important
i wish i had my board with me now even if i could only polish it once in awhile
yes talby what is it
sh talby do not bother me now
ah well i think i have found the malfunction sir i am in the emergency air lock
not now
well i am in the emergency air lock and
calm down talby i am coming
here i am i think i am spinning we are both falling talby in opposite directions away from each other my my jetpack s gone
what happened doolittle
doolittle i think it is the phoenix asteroids
no kidding
i am going into them i am going to hit them doolittle
i am glad you have come to talk with me doolittle it is been so long since anyone has come to talk with me
that is that sir
tell me doolittle how are the dodgers doing
well sir the dodgers broke up disbanded over thirteen years ago
ah pity pity
you do not understand sir we cannot get the bomb to drop
what was that doolittle
negative effect
it did not work
that is correct sir
sorry doolittle i have forgotten so much since i have been in here so much
what should we do sir the time is running out
well what you might try is
doolittle hello
sorry sir you faded out there for a minute
oh yes doolittle i am thinking
we are running out of time sir
oh yes well doolittle if you cannot get it to drop you will have to talk to it
i already have sir and pinback is talking to it now
no no doolittle you talk to it teach it phenomenology doolittle
yeah the skipper always was lucky
she is punishing me for being honest i should just go to her house
i do not know i am so i cannot believe she would be so goddamn immature
they cannot erase memories it is a joke it is a nasty clementine hoax

i am scared i want my mommy i do not want to lose you i do not want to lose
joel joely look it is not fading the memory i think we are hidden
he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased

hide me somewhere deeper somewhere buried
this kid joe early is going to beat the shit out of me
thanks joely a present oh boy
i love it
this is our first date date
do you remember what we talked about
naomi i guess
god i should know your hair was red i remember it matched the wallpaper
egad were you horrified
no i think you were wearing that black dress y know with the buttons
i will buy that black s always good
we did talk about naomi
i said are you sure you seem unsure
i am sure i said
but you were not i could tell
i was so nervous i remember i could not think of anything to say there were long silences
so what infatuation is good too
and i did not have an argument
come up and see me now
it is very late
yes exactly exactly my point
is that what you want
i did it i guess that means something
sorry to track you down like this i am not a stalker but i needed to see you
well you are married
not yet not married
i had you pegged did not i
you had the whole human race pegged
i know
it would be different if we could just give it another go around
remember me try your best maybe we can
i saw you sitting over here by yourself i thought thank god someone normal who does not know how interact at these things either
yeah i do not ever know what to say
yeah i know i am fishing
you said
and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers
i am joel
yeah like that
nope no jokes my favorite thing when i was a kid was my huckleberry hound doll i think your name is magic
i know
what do we do
enjoy it say good bye
i know what you mean that is why i stopped
but my sleeping is really fucked up
i do not think i have slept in a year
i love her
really me too i do not meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store
i think she is great
me too there s this poem
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
i think before
seems too coincidental that way
yeah maybe
yeah yeah it goes perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines
yes i love that poem it breaks my heart i am so excited you know it look houses in which we do not live
um no
let s move into this neighborhood
it is freezing out here
i hesitated for what seemed like forever
i could see you wanted to come in joel
i knew by your nervousness that naomi was not the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
it is dark
yeah that is your girlfriend s name
i think we should go
i walked out the door there s no more memory
come back and make up a good bye at least let s pretend we had one
i love you
i do not know
what if
joel come here please
make love
have sex y know
oh um
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now
that is okay i
i am sorry i just wanted to say that this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and
hey joel
and i am just too nervous around you right now
i am nervous too
yeah i would not have thought that
well you obviously do not know me
i am nervous because i have and enormous crush on you
says you were a bully
a bully moi
that is what it says you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
well sounds like me sorry man says you were jealous and suspicious
says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it
i do not know
does not sound like me
says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
we should have sex it is old hat for us
i cannot stop thinking about you
yay meet me after work by the old mill
what old mill is that somewhere we
i just wanted to say that come by my house
i just walked in
hmmm do you miss me
oddly enough i do
ha ha you said i do i guess that means we are married
i guess so
tomorrow night honeymoon on ice
i probably got the same thing as you
i mean i have not even told anyone i have met you who would even know to do this
maybe it is true then it is my voice on the tape
that is what you have to say how could it be true i never even heard of any procedure like this it is a joke
i know i spoke to my friend magda

there are two of them could not make them out the orange glow of a cigarette
i am like a joke to them
it is too late
clementine i should just maybe talk to her
i was not going to call her not after the way she was

this is it the night we met my god it is over
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf
i did not want to go i was too nervous i thought maybe you were a nut but you were exciting you called from upstairs
well technically the procedure itself is brain damage but on a par with a night of heavy drinking nothing you will miss
well i did
we can help you through this why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine
it was a mess i do not know how it got this way
you have to stop this

you must be making some big deals doing lunch in a place like this
i am working on a few things
yeah i hear you bagged martin weir for mr lovejoy
boy this town word gets around does not it
chili palmer showed you my script
yeah i was wondering why he should do that
you serious
all i want in return is to work on the movie with you fact i already got some ideas on how to fix it up
you are gonna just give me five hundred grand
we will talk about that harry but first i gotta know how would you hook up with chili palmer
leo i do not know
it was waiting out there on another deal one that did not go through one you do not want to know about
it is not the kind of thing you do
that is the magic number
what i been wondering is where is he been
yeah where have you been we have not heard from you lately
by friday man or you are fucking dead as disco
i am already in town but it do not matter we got dick in the bank we dumped it all in harry s movie
what i am saying is the man wants his money and he wants it now
who is this
are you the guy they called ray bones
depends who s this
the three hundred grand a guy named leo devoe scammed off an airline the three hundred grand chili palmer now has in his possession
yeah i am here i just do not like the anonymous crap it means your either chickenshit or not for real
yeah well trust me i am very for real
okay so who are you
i work for harry zimm alright
never heard of him
hey zimm does not ask for dick zimm tells you the way it is or else
or else what
or else use your fucking imagination
ray look at me
you say look at you
that is correct look at me
i told them i was you i acted stupid and they believed me
so what brings you to l a bones
do not insult me get up and turn around
cause the guy s a customer now stupid his ass belongs to me
yeah which terminal
ray barboni from miami
what like that is supposed to mean something to me
he owes me money
get in line bro
i do not like waiting
tough shit bro this ai not miami you want something talk to me
hey fuckball i do not need your permission l a s an open city
whatta you got there some kinda pop nine the fucking fiat of guns always jamming at the wrong time
that is right
what are you doing in los angeles
i am in the movie business
you are an investor is that it
i am a producer
you have a card in here
not yet i just started
i am i am a fan of everything that is l a i love it out here
it was c i do not know sixteen or seventeen one of those why you looking for anyway a bomb or something
something should not be there
why do not you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look maybe you will find it
that is the idea i will think about it
that is what i would do make sure i got the right guy next time
get him out have here
what have you got
guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand sixty days over a movie producer
movie producer yeah why not
where you been harry
we just did i told you my name s chili palmer
you look okay to me harry come over here and sit down tell me what you been up to
i want you to keep looking right here okay
that is what i am doing
you know dick allen mesa s casino
dick allen s a very dear friend of mine how far you want to go with this
harry lemme give you some advice
i know what a marker is
why do i have to keep looking at you
i want you to
you gonna get rough now threaten me i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken
karen it is a pleasure how you doing
you just did
i mean the way you told it to me start at the beginning we see how the story line develops
that is right as a matter of fact
well since leo s name was on the passenger list
i said i had an idea that is all
the shylock he is barely mentioned and it is not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast
wait a minute you are not the guy are you the dry cleaner
you mean leo
you would not be talking to me if you were
i am not the guy harry
but you work for the casino
i am out here looking for leo i just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend dick allen
so you do not work for the casino
what i did till recently after i get done here i will think about what i am gonna do next
they always paid
not really
what does that mean
maybe a few times i have
ever shot anybody
i have been picked up a couple times loan sharking racketeering but i was never convicted i am clean
racketeering that covers a lot of ground does not it
because i need half a million to buy a script
for a movie
a blockbuster but quality no mutants or maniacs this one s gonna be my driving miss daisy
that is it called
mr lovejoy
mr lovejoy that is the title
it is not bad when you know what it is about
martin weir he played the mob guy that turned snitch in the cyclone
one of his best parts
no his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt whitney
ride the clouds good picture
heart attack apparently they brought a couple hookers along
i am not gonna pop her harry
just a thought
harry i probably know em better than you do
what do you get out of this
let s see how we get along
read it it is a grabber
that is right they are wondering who s this guy you do not tell em understand harry do not tell em who i am
i had to tell em something
never say anything unless you have to
hey harry
yeah chili hi you are fifty feet in the air
get the fuck outta my chair
cash it happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport
i mean at least bo s invested in three of my movies
a meeting with who you and karen
you have it
who the fuck is momo jesus these fucking names
do not waste your time harry the guy s not much of a movie fan now c mon gimme the key
he died
how would you know he died he tell you
what get away jet
it was in the herald
yeah well maybe the guy took out flight insurance check with the wife
hey it is your book now you want to check it out go ahead he is got a dry cleaning business out on federal highway
e g means for example ray i think what you wanna say is i e
bullshit e g is short for ergo
ask your man here
twenty seven hundred
you know marty you were good in the cyclone
it is more like your attitude your tone your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves in your opinions your indifference to conventional views
you mean like we do not give a shit
no i do not though i have to say i am curious
so you want to know
if you would like to tell me yeah
i am thinking of a movie
one of mine
one we are producing
with what wiseguy money
what happened the pressure got to you
pressure i am the one applied the pressure
martin look at me
i am looking at you
what you are telling me you are tired you wanna go to bed
wait how about this
now you are squinting like you need glasses
that is not bad
that is what i think of you asshole nothing
i believe it
i turn it on when i confront the guy
yeah but you have not found him yet the guy took off for las vegas
how do i know that
good looking too like karen
you are not going to tell me the rest
yeah i like it i am high up i can see everything you know it is the cadillac of minivans
that is that
that is not bad i think you got it down
i did not know where else to keep it where would you
you are here a while that is wrong with a bank
they report it to the irs
you do not open an account leo you put it in a safe deposit box dip in whenever you want
i am up twelve grand today
from when you left vegas with four fifty
who told you that
now you are down to three ten in the case you must have cooled off quite a bit since you got here
how would you know i was here
here s another tip
i would not let her if she tried why i am here leo basically is to save your ass
how by taking my money
you can keep what you won today that is yours
it is all mine
sit down leo
at eighteen percent okay and do not ask me no more fucking questions i am leaving
i will find you leo
you see a black leather jacket fingertip length like the one pacino wore in serpico you do not you owe me three seventy nine
maybe you do not see my sign
i know who he works for where is your phone
you broke in
no it was open it was not locked
what if it was
i know what a vig is
that is right three percent
but a week that is a hundred and fifty percent a year
what are you doing here
i wanted to come by apologize for coming into your house like i did last night
lemme get this straight you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before
no no you left the patio door open you gotta stop doing that all the nice things you got around here
yeah well make sure you lock it on the way out
rough day on the set
i spent all day crawling out of a grave the costumer kept bitching cause i was ripping my nylons –
ripped nylons work makes the shot more real
that is what we finally decided
like in bride of the mutant when you played the whole end with that torn top
for any movie
i married martin that was a full time job
you read harry s new one he says it is the best thing he is ever read
he must mean after slime creature 3
that why harry came over last night see if you could help him get martin in his movie
yeah well martin is known for his flipping he flips over a script and when the time comes to make a deal he flips out
tell you what i will stop by harry s office and pick up a copy for you
do not go out of your way
right see how your story ends
yeah right listen touch of evil s playing near my hotel you wanna go check it out watch charlton heston play a mexican
i just caught the end
i already read it harry left a copy at the house
what do you think
i do not like the title or the main guy s name
then you have read it
not yet
you and harry will make a great team i am gonna make a deal with him
there a part in it for you
i do not want to act in it i want to produce it with harry especially if i help him get martin
sounds fair
what do you get out of it
i want to know
why does anyone want to be in movies
yesterday you were a loan shark
you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant
yeah we understand you read the script and like it a lot
the guy s setting you up you pulled out of their freaks deal so he is paying you back
depends who pays
not unlike the way nicki met him except it was a wrap party why
i do not know i am just having some trouble seeing you two together
you do not like martin much do you
how about get shorty except that is not a movie that is real life
how about chili s hollywood adventure
you thought i was faking
no i do not mean that i just meant in general

in his inside coat pocket
i went to give him his refund so he would not have to come here
how would you know where he was
i found out
and you did not tell the police
i told jackie and jackie said you wanted him
that looks like fifty thousand dollars from here
hey jackie
she wants to make a deal
she sound scared
she almost sounds scared
that is she want
she wants to go back to work
that is she willing to give us
she has not one into specifics yet she is been waiting for you
she knows it is my case
she ai not said it but she is not stupid she knows it is you who wants her
every step of this goes in my report i am now taking a manila envelope from the subject s flight bag
what time do you have to be there
the usual things i am a flight attendant with cabo air
this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms would you mind if we looked in that bag
if i were to tell you no it is not
arrest me
while you are at it let me see what else is in there you mind
that is in it
beauty products
that is my diet shit
i am telling you i do not know nothing about that fucking shit
take your time
help you get ordell robbie
course i do i deliver money for him
can you do it or not
that is her name
he would not say you gonna follow her
she leaves somebody will be on her
but you are not going to stop her
who do you think i am
can i see your i would
you are serious
in cash
sure ever been to the riverbottom
i do not think so
it is okay it is a cop hangout
could not we just stop at a seven eleven
i thought you might want a drink
i would love one but not there
we could stop at the hilton by the airport
is it dark
it is kind of a sports bar
that does not sound dark
why does it need to be dark
cause i look like i just got outta jail that is why you dropping me off at home right there s a place by me
ten pounds i lose it and put it back on
that is why i do not quit if i cannot fly anymore i am gonna have a bitch of a time getting my brand
that is your brand
i am as a matter of fact
i had em too i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down then their asses lucked out and found that coke
what did they want to know
that is him how do you know em
i wrote him on monday they found him dead on tuesday
ordell pick up his bond
same as you ten thousand
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont
you mentioned a guy from l a p would but you did not mention the federal
i did not
no you did not what branch
ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms
it was the other guy who busted me
how many trips did you make
with ten thousand nine
he is got that kinda money
yeah if i cooperate
well jackie you got caught you are gonna have to give em something
i think maybe i have more options than i thought
i am have a seat
i felt a lot safer having it my milk went bad when i was in jail
black s fine
you went out this morning and bought a gun
you went out this morning and bought a gun
it looks nice
i got a few but i cannot afford to start all over again i got too much time and money invested in my records
uh huh
who is this
the delfonics
it is nice
are you
i want to talk to them first i know more now about ordell s money
well if the a t f guy is the one who wants you that will only interest him up to a point
it is a lot of money about a half a million dollars all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more coming in
how would you find that out
he told me last night
he called you
he came by
what what would you do
we talked
no thanks there s gotta be other ways to get it out
same way i been doin but first they got to let me go back to work
you are gonna offer to set him up
if i get let off otherwise fuck em
it is very possible ordell s killed somebody
i ai not going to jail and i ai not doing that probation thing again
you are not old you look great
i am asking how you feel does it bother you
it is not really something i think about
how would you feel about it
you know i cannot really feel too sorry for you in that department
i just feel like i am always starting over you said how many bonds you wrote
fifteen thousand
i know ignoring me what are you up to
catching a movie
what would ya see
american president
how was it
pretty good me and annette bening are goin steady
oh are you does she know that
no i do not believe she is ever heard of me but that does not mean we are not going steady
for now these relationships never last too long
sandra bullock you know her
yeah she is the girl who drove the bus in speed she is cute
she is adorable but i had to end it
how old s annette
i do not care
i go back to work tomorrow
you talk them into it
they seem to like the idea
bring the money in and they follow it
yea but i am going to dress it up put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here
you do not actually do it that way
right around here in the food court
sit down leave the bag under the table
i am helping him bring his money into america he loves the idea you just missed him
he was here
yeah we were going over everything that is why all the bags
i called you last night
maybe but i am thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself
i do not follow your logic what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell s money
he is setting me up to make a proposition
i see
you do not propose something like that unless you are pretty sure the other person s into it
has he hinted around
he were not bullshitting either cause later he was suspended and forced to retire
has nicolet told you any colorful stories like that
what if i was in nicolet s place
no i mean you right now not it you were somebody else
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money would i take it
you know where it came from it is not like it is anybody s life savings it would not even be missed
a half a million dollars will always be missed
you are avoiding the question
okay sure i might be tempted especially now since i am getting out of the bail bonds business
when did you decide
it is been a long time coming i finally made up my mind i guess it was thursday
the day you got me out of jail
uh huh
and went to this guy s house in el monte and i waited for him
what do you do when he comes home
shoot him with the stun gun while he is incapacitated cuff him take em to county
you do that
that is my job
did you do it that night
more or less
which one
if you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a half million dollars would you take it
i believe i said i would be tempted
what if i have figured a way
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now it is only money
do you think they bought it
oh yeah i got them thinking ordell s real nervous they love thinking he is scared of them
you know a good cop will not let you know he knows you are fulla shit
all he needed was a reasonable explanation
do not be so literal ray believed it
but you still have to show him the money at the airport
well you know i am not going to show him the whole amount he will see fifty thousand
where is the rest of it
in the bag underneath
what if he checks it
he will not i mean he did not the last time he will be expecting fifty thousand and there it is on top
you are taking a helluva chance kid
not really if he finds it i say mr walker put the money in and i did not know nothing about it like the coke
then you are out and you get nothing
yeah but i am not in jail and i tried
you are gonna have surveillance all over you
that is why you do not make a move till i come out of the fitting room
in a dress
well a suit there s one i had my eye on
all winston had to do was ask around ordell s living in long beach with a woman junkie
how does winston find him if a t f and all the local police cannot
everybody wants him he is a homicide suspect it does not matter who brings him in he is gonna name you as an accessory
get ordell to come to your office
set him up
uh huh
tell him you want to see him
tell him i want to give him his money
what do you tell nicolet
ordell called and wants to meet me and i am scared
we get ordell to come to my office nicolet is he already there or does he come busting in while we are chatting
what if he hears something he is not supposed to
well we do not let that happen now do we
less ten percent
yeah your fee i had to figure that out since there was not no note
i hesitated taking that much
you worked for it if you are sure that is all you want
i am sure
that is he doing
i told him i might
i did not say you did
i never lied to you
i know
we are partners
i am fifty five years old i cannot blame anybody for anything i do
do you blame yourself for helping me
you will get over that
start off in madrid ever been there
thanks but you have a good time
sure i cannot twist your arm
thank you for saying that but no my business
i thought you were tired of your business
i am just tired in general
are you scared of me
i beg your pardon
what if i plead guilty
and cooperate you might get probation
if i do not cooperate
do you live together
not every day
then you do not see him for a few days
you know that is in the bag you are taking
he say is a surprise
well sheronda it was nice talking to you
what the fuck is that shit
i know what it looks like
you planted that shit on me
it is not enough for trafficking but how about posession with the intent to distribute
can i smoke
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job
we can look into that
i need it tomorrow if i do not show up for work tomorrow i am fired
you know what we want
if i am working i can help you
you never asked me if i did or not
he sells guns
you ever see him sell guns
he told me besides why else would an a t f man be after him
how can you help us
i thought you were going to let this one through
a broadway shopping bag
you two meet
not really
his full name is louis gara he just got out from serving four years in susanville
what for
bank robbery do you know what he does for ordell
i imagine shit needs to be done
we have been following mr gara and he is definitely working for ordell
ever meet her or they talk about her
not yet
who s the other one
white girl named melanie ralston another girlfriend of ordell s
that is her story
i am sure that was the idea
what did you say
i smiled and walked away she also told me ordell killed beaumont
she told you that
uh huh
was she there
she did not say
but she mentioned beaumont by name
uh huh
well this sounds like a lady i would like to have a word with so everything s set for tomorrow
right everything s the same except one change
well it is true is not it after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else what do you think
we could if i am not in jail
oh that is taken care of i called the state attorney s office you were no filed this morning in circuit court
i was told ten thousand in each pack
you did not count it
i never have it is not my money
what to put one of these in my pocket
uh huh
after all it do not belong to nobody right
that would be one point of view
you did not i would think with all this on your mind you would wait till after
because i did not have it ray i swear melanie came in and grabbed it and someone killed her for it
i had to i was frantic i did not know what to do
what did you do after that
not in the fitting room
i did not see him i was in my underwear if it was a white guy it was probably louis he kill melanie
it is possible you are saying you do not have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand
i have no idea
you would take a polygraph on it
if it will make you happy
i sure hope you have not done anything dumb jackie
i thought you were watching him
what about you
do you think i took some of that money
buy ya a beer
i am waiting for the phone
good luck that guy s been in there since i got here
well i guess i better look for another one then thanks anyway
better get me another sam s join me in a jaeger shot
uh uh
gimme one anyway
this time almost a year i have known him forever
what were you two fighting about
that coke was yours was not it

it is impossible
it is what she asked for it is what i am going to do
she was being symbolic what if she asked you to fly to the moon
you would be visiting me at nasa
i will make it
why did you take the back roads here they are not safe you would know that if you would planned
maybe later
you should definitely have children they are really special
how serious is it
i will not let you die
put out a p b s or whatever it is called
a couple days to a few months if untreated
thank you
do not wait by the phone if he is really been walking this whole time he is out of our jurisdiction
no i just do not want anybody dying because i did not say something when i had the chance
you need a ride preacher
that is enough
it can but it will have to wait in line
it is hard to say it is a delicate surgery there s no getting around the fact that it is a very high risk situation
routine i assure you i just wanted to gage my health am i healthy
yes you are
i am going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar
you do
i have seen it before
you have
no how far in one attempt that is the farthest someone like myself could walk
there was no card
it is just a regular day
honey i told you if it makes you happy we should just do it
it is a tremendous amount of work moving
we can do it together
that is that that is not a fortune you will be rich that is a fortune what you have is a statement
what it is is the truth
i do not follow
sometimes people need to see things done for them because sooner or later they do not believe the words anymore
you do not think i love you
you are talking to me
why do you polish it
why are you polishing it in bed in your pajamas at 11 15 at night are you going to show it to someone
there s no reason

i have changed my mind
you cannot change your mind

i asked the officers if you had committed some crime if they had said yes you would be speaking with them right now
pacifica california

philadelphia pennsylvania
i see

and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them
that is a reasonable assumption
i do not want my wife s soul having any doubts
doubts about what
about my love for her
his name is maurice he is dancing around everything else
red flag man
not our problem
why so vague why so evasive he could be somebody hot
not our problem
it is going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the steadman s house
this guy s not a murderer
if he is half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack asses
maurice and ellen parker it was issued in philly mr maurice parker has come a long way from home why

so i have been informed
she never ate a slice
the grapes of wrath
you are amazing
i missed you to mr parker
adelle told me your writing is going well the crusader for social issues and all
you were right from the heart is always better
i was thinking you could open another store with investors i am sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now
what come on
i cannot do it i want you to finish but i want you to live more
i do
why in god s name did you fly all the way here then
do not do this
it is mine to risk
no more words until i touch the ocean with my hands it is all just words

confused i am not sure what to do now i am not sure what he wants for me
he wants to reward you that is why i am here
what do you mean
i mean you have done a great thing you should be rewarded monetarily
what who are you
evening news
we did a piece after your story ran in the new york times
it is yours
no i will not take it unless i pay for it let s see that is a pretty nice watch i can see that
this is not right
precisely faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant
then we smash em
anything left for smashing you may happily smash
i have something far more pleasant awaiting me
purely a precaution
no smashing is not required i have a surprise for our tiny invaders raise that hatch
i doubt the faeries will admire their beauty come this will be fun to watch
indeed the best of fun enjoy yourselves
this is another victory my friends what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress
you go to lady now
to finish last evening s delightful work
what do you want with me
your love
your words sting more sharply than your whip
i speak of love and you think only of the lash
you are cruel your heartless jesting worse than torture how can you speak of love when you see what i am
i like well what i see it pleases me
but i am hideous
you are magnificent
grotesque monstrous
you should glory in your animal nature it is your triumph none know that better than i
not from me surely
you you are a beast
we are all of us beasts my dear only most are afraid to show it
and you are you not also afraid
i am afraid of nothing
then why hide behind a mask you are ashamed
i know no more of shame than i do of fear i wear this mask not for concealment but protection
i prefer to think more like the sagacious owl
do you feed on mice and rats
i prefer a plump capon but will happily serve you rats if they are to your liking
why have you brought me here
to be my bride of course
i would soon die
we are both of us damned my beauty
do it now
no now is the time for discipline some lessons in obedience for the future baroness
kill me i want so nice
why should i kill you a simple course in etiquette something your parents sadly overlooked
what do you want from me
at the moment very little your company at my table
oh yes
a few day s nourishment will see your strength returning
and then
when you are ripe for my pleasure i will enjoy the harvest
i see
i am pleased you are not troubled by the prospect
do as you wish with my body you will never possess my soul
your soul why should i bother with such a paltry trifle
i do not expect you would understand
indeed i am my dear that makes us a pair
it is nothing my men take great delight in routing the enemy do not trouble yourself beauty
it sounded like it came from the courtyard
from the parapets most likely the men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving
might we watch too
later beloved now i wish only to be with you
pleasure is for those who seize it do you think those insipid pale skinned mortals will ever know such rapture
now i want to live forever i have never felt so strong or happy
or looked so beautiful
yes i feel that too weakness is what is ugly
precisely my darling your animal strength your primitive power has surfaced you are what you desire
to be strong and free that is all i desire
i did not know i
what speakee loud no hear velly good
i said i mean no harm i thought this as empty tomb
you come stealee tleasoo
oh no never nothing like that never crossed my mind
no need lie boy i no hurt you do i look like i wanna hurt you
well er no i mean you do not look like dragons i have heard of
course not i no flum here i come flum cathay
east of mercia
you got no idee people there lookee diffelent speakee diffelent nothing the same in my countlee i bling good luck makee lain and thunder
you do not ravage the countryside devouring maidens and burning the crops
dlagon not like that dlagon is spilit of life spilit of stlength and goodness
it is terrible
ang how you do it how you rift cuss
i need your help in order to fight blackheart i must wear the armor of achilles i
you come stealee tleasoo
oh no do not you understand
no more listening your time is at an end insignificant whelp
or was it the time you and jimmy squarefoot stole the golden apples i would forged
screwball you know and many other of the wee folk we serve as escort for our grand champion jack o the green
there s a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it and a silver key no lock can resist
gump is it
aye honeythorn gump come to serenade you jack come to make you dance
i am in no mood for dancing
oh but you will be jack think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a dancing
faerie ring
to be sure
dance jack the night s but begun
you will have a long long rest in the tomb me lad
i meant no disrespect
did not you now well then answer me this riddle and all be forgiven
and if i cannot
why jack then tis your death song i will be strumming
a riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you are thirsty for wine
well spoke true to the mark and if it is wine you are wanting it is wine we shall have
i am honored honeythorn gump but no more tricks
you have me word lad to answer a faerie riddle deserves as much
twas the princess lili gave me the answer have you seen her by chance
i have laid eyes on no mortal but you this day jack
i fear she is lost
mayhap you be the one that is lost and she safe by the castle hearth but come jack we will warm your bones
it looks er delicious such a fine bouquet very aromatic
generally known what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots
please do not misunderstand i am grateful for your hospitality and
he is afraid of enchantment will you listen to the fool prattle on
big question that lad why what
why has this happened to the world why is it winter now and dark
aye honeythorn gump would be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer
do not you know
if you are looking for enchantment jack that i can give thee
then that is gone wrong why did it happen
if ye want more tricks i am your man but for big questions ye must go elsewhere
do not you care about that is happened
true but it will not come easy or free if ye want to ask ask jenny greenteeth
jenny greenteeth who s she
aye on the morrow we go but tonight tonight is for making merry
aye that foul wallow be where jenny greenteeth dwells oona lure her out play the part of a girl child
what do i do
do not get caught that is what she will suck your bones like honey comb
fie on what she thinks you mind her claws and teeth cast your spell oona
lamentable news jack but tis the fate of the living concerns us now
did you hear twas the killing of the unicorn caused it
aye black baron s mischief
if the horn be restored the curse is ended
time for a champion can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird s nests jack
i will do what i have to do for princess lili s sake
bravely spoke you have the heart of a champion true enough
twill take more than heart where do we find the armor of achilles for a start
i know where to find it taking possession be another matter
have we turned grave robber then
a tomb it once was boy and a tomb it may yet be there s another in residence at lindfarne now
and who might that be
no less a creature than the lindfarne worm
you do the praying i have work ahead
there s the spirit lad if ye run into trouble give a yank here and we will haul ye up
that is left of me how do i recognize the armor of achilles
better we eat him than the other way round
no false modesty lad you are a proper champion achilles armor sits on you like it was forged to fit
something s coming
it would appear so
careful lad
the colt s still too small
i am small and i can make myself smaller still small as a bee small as dust want to see me do it
we have no time for tricks this day honeythorn gump
aye that too
you will need more than bird droppings for blackheart
i will drop a cow on the knave
drop a mountain on him and we will not need our troops
we march on castle couer de noir within the hour
how do you plan on finding this here castle if ye do not mind me asking
a true and troubling question gump we will start from where the unicorn was killed the baron must have left a trail
track the demon to his lair
aye and hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying
whatever for
jenny greenteeth said follow the raven in her flight
aye said to follow it to the edge of night but is this the right bird
i am sure it spoke to me
birds speak to me all the time what did it say
send oona up above the tree tops she be our eyes
good plan that
foul fellow this couer de noir
the foulest mayhap i can cut them free
jack do not
what know you of fields of war
well if the knight be already dead what harm is there in borrowing a thing or two
stealing his arms
that would be devil s needle last landmark i know in these woods
nay jack tis not what you are thinking
i trust our own welcome will be more hospitable
nay that is but to distract the casual visitor a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly
better to kill than be disturbed
pure gold it is plays a different note every time
something the matter
ogg s footprints
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet
certainly understandable
very secretive they are keep their feet covered up best if you do not mention it
gump you are putting words in my mouth
stoutly spoke lad these dwarves be sore grouches pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling
tis not the sword that counts but the man what swings it rest easy jack
god protect you honeythorn gump
your strong right arm s all the protection i will need this night
we will surely be in our graves if we do not
going grows slower we have not made half a mile in two hours
there s the way mates
it bodes evil
stay on your guard jack the bug is enchanted surely
no thank the lord but she be sore envenomed by the spider s bite
we are blind now oona was our eyes and ears how do we find the castle couer de noir without her
we will find it
easily said the raven passed this way hours ago
heading true north we continue in that direction
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course
we will trust in faith gump
aye lad we have little else to go by
long as we do not lose heart jack
we will never find the baron s castle
once you thought we would never find the greek s armor and look at ye now decked out like a proper hero
nay this time we strike first
nay i show no pity to imps and fiends
i know the rogue jack tis jimmy squarefoot
but seem to have gotten lost on the way
no but what choice have we
the chill is worse this night
it is your own fear troubles you we are here are not we for all the dark magic protecting it
it feels wrong jack like a trap
there s more than one way to spring a trap
aye so long as you are not too greedy for the bait
on the morrow i will be awake enough to see if dreams come true
pray they do not turn out to be nightmares
we will need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders
why not mine the damned walls
we do both our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under
defend ourselves we have bested far worse already
easily spoken
do not loose heart assemble the archers have everyone not holding a shield man a bow shoot the damned things as they fly
there are not enough arrows
never mind just do it retrieve the arrows somehow
and frog do not fly and bite like tomcats it be magic jack powerful ogre s magic
there is not much time
been telling you that all along lad
what magic have we on our side
faerie magic s no match for a sorcerer s power we have ogg s gifts the key and the
there must be some way to get it up there
that is it
aye before the wee pesties attacked
then it is godspeed screwball
fire away
best get down close to the moat lad
aye we are good as inside
it is what we will find there worries me
nonsense course it matters
the princess lili i have killed her
the wound is mortal
nay you have not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine
can you save her
easily the question is can we save ourselves be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war
i do not understand
the alicorn lad come to your senses unless we find baron couer de noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed
in the dark lad why should he do that
because sunlight will kill him quickly now give me the key
sunlight you say
aye hurry now gump the key
mean you to seek him out below
i am not afraid of the dark
i admire your valor jack by all means seek him out but first we needs visit the kitchen
did you bring me here to sup
nay lad we are here to collect a weapon you will need fighting the baron
what weapon
easier than that jack screwball fetch me down a couple of them plates
patience lad
ah but you will and so will the baron when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway
tis a delicate operation lad requires a bit of engineering next
do not get too far
hurry up
never show mercy
i could have struck off his head just now
he will not escape me
you are on your own like a true champion
i have not heard a note out of you
not in the mood i am afraid
listen to him not in the mood
on a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen a day so fair as forty springtimes
i am not denying it is a joyous day
where is your joy if you cannot sing
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst
she lives is not that worth singing about
she lives like all the world before the baron s curse lifted now the world s reborn yet still she sleeps
tis not the wound that is sure not a scar remains we are talking about a spell harder to repair than sword work
i will do anything face any challenge
might not need a gesture quite so grand what were you doing the very moment the baron s curse fell on the world
i was with the princess
go on go on
she tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it said she would marry me if i did
and did you
nay it was lost when i came up for air the pond was frozen over
that is it then the ring
i will try
you are good at riddles find the ring and the spell is broken
hush up screwball do your own worm sticking if you like the taste so well
nay jack s the dragon slayer ai not you jack
wolf slayer worm sticker give a cheer for the champion
no no no this is different
these chaps will need a woodpecker to pick their teeth
screwball be quiet we have friends live neath the needle they will no doubt provide safe refuge for the night
gonna make ogre stew
three cheers for our champion
very thrifty even got your arrow back
they have fired the moat
you will do it because i am you liege and i command you to do it
rise screwball and into the basket with you
nay sire i will cling to it as to life itself
good lad here jack give me a hand with the windlass there s a good fellow
they will do nicely
oh jack you are a wild man to use me so
if you like
i may have said perhaps
sport indeed
the baron is a frightful man they say he is an ogre he wears a mask so none may see his face
blackheart aptly named
oh fie what about the unicorn
all right i will show you something sacred
stop complaining
a gentleman would offer water
only were he a fool to boot see yon viper
i detest serpents
that viper has envenomed the water no animal will drink here now
what shall we do
be patient
that is the matter
i have lost my napkin it was all elf work and lace i must have dropped it when you startled me so
i will go search for it
do not leave me now i fear the unicorn will not show himself without you
i am not its master
the napkin will keep i would rather not be alone
your command is my wish princess lili
in these woods you are a commoner now be quiet true royalty approaches
they rival the angels of paradise
oh jack might not i touch one it would thrill me so
are you honest
he will not flee if i show myself
not if you be chaste tis an awesome test of virginity
i have no fear of failure your implications are most unbecoming
i am not your judge nor have i any desire to witness the trial
to fetch your napkin
i do not know they have hurt the unicorn
damned hunters it was a trap and you were the bait
i did not know i did not it was so lovely he was in my lap like like a baby and i
they tricked you
my own father
how bad was the unicorn s wound
it happened so fast he was hurt and ran away
he did run
oh yes and the mare with him
good they will never catch him there s not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn
i do not want it on me
its powers are strong
i do not want to be reminded of what happened
do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood
jack green jack you must not flatter me so
tis the truth
a maid must beware of flattery methinks you want to kiss me
there s no happier thought under heaven
if i were your bride would the kissing ever stop do you wish to marry me jack
my lady mocks me
nay jack i am but wary of your intentions
my heart intends no more than that you love me as i do you
oh la
let it have not you a cozy bower we might hide in
tis not fit for a princess
be it fit for your wife green jack
i have no wife
then perchance you will me
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride
do you wish it jack wish you this our wedding band
what if i answer yes will my wish come true
jack forgive me
only that is right
i was bewitched it is better this way
they told me you were dead
you have freed me jack
it is the baron s damnable work too cowardly to stand and fight he used you to save himself
no it is not you he is afraid of it is light
so he is hiding in the dark
in the dark where i join him
no do not let go you must not i love you
and i love you
whilst you were sleeping i fetched your ring
i cannot have been under much more than a minute
seemed like weeks and weeks such a terrible dream i could never tell you

oh no dearest jack i meant every word
you are teasing still
lili i love you
and i love you my husband
ouch something s biting me
biting you
pinching me
pinching where
everywhere ow
i cannot see a thing
ow whatever it is it hurts
grand champion is it and what great cause leads you to me
we seek the ogre baron couer de noir he slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter
thought the weather terrible of late
his feet shall never cross my lips
another hero s hand me down thurgis note the armor tis greek work
i bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty
well spoke boy you have discerning taste for one so young just who might you be
they call me green jack ma am
come closer then jack that i might give you proper thanks
your fair smile be thanks enough better i stand afar to admire your beauty complete
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you
the moon is too round of face methinks
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross all the heavenly angels must envy your grace
i like well your conceit jack tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world
why then there thou hast we be lucky worse has not befallen us
couer de noir a demon if the devil ever made one
he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot
follow the raven in her flight follow old black wing to the edge of night
not very precise directions
come sit beside me sweet boy and i will draw you a map
nay tempting as your invitation be tell me one thing more
ask away sweet man
what became of the princess
princess i know of no princess
princess lili godwin s daughter she was with me when calamity struck but after i could find no trace of her
is she fair this princess
exceeding fair
as fair as me
twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky
she is dead
i do not believe you
far as you are concerned she is dead believe it or not
do not be sad jack not with me here to give you cheer
tis not the time to speak of cheer
you will visit again
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom
what a fine meal you would make be the rest of you sweet as your tongue
i pray god grants it me
then i would kiss you without turning my garments inside out and sewing bells all over
no need for bells jack i will nay enchant ye
no fear of that now
then tis not for chastity methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night
i would be honored
only that
and charmed of course
fie do not speak of charms i should charm you for being so dull witted
i had no thought of offending you oona
do i not please you jack
in every way
and am i not fair
wondrously so
then why do you speak sweeter words to jenny greenteeth
that was in jest
jest with me then
how so
tell me i am fair as you did the hag
you are fair as the first new flower of spring
and sweet
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind
pray you be sweet as your words dear jack
a faerie s love makes anything possible
i am promised to another
what shape i take matters not long you for another i will give you your heart s desire
you you you mortal you
threats will not make me love you tis not the way of the human heart
i would build a wall around me with such stone so the likes of you might never enter
be fair oona
you beware jack you and your porridge pot heart
heading north still
true north straight up that pass through the net
i know where to find him he lies out on the marsh raven fodder his horn torn from his head

small miracles better than no miracles
of course they are alive all nature is living
come on gump let s have a look at this witchcraft
his honor i suppose seeing he no longer can defend it
bah you faeries have the morals of ferrets
have not heard a bird sing in days
or a kite we could make a kite let the wind do the work

no speeches that is a little swim after sticking worms and ogres
i slew the lindfarne worm with it
sigurd the volsung slew fafnir with that blade see the line where regin welded the break
achilles wore it before the gates of troy

were you supposed to have a session
no it is sort of spur of the moment
a friend
i am fine
you are the shrink are not you
no not really
but you do therapy
not any more

oh for god s sake phyllis we have no reason to doubt the man are we listening to lionel now
no dr delbanco it is i who am sorry sorry to have wasted your time with such
i do not think you know dr sheeler she is the other therapist here in town
of course i have heard great things about you
right now
are we
i think i have heard of him a disciple of rothberg was not he
dorothy fowler fantastic woman she passed last year in a train wreck damned amtrak
my approach
and please for whatever small way i may have encouraged this accept my apologies there is good news though
that is that
phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city which leaves you the only psychologist in town
dr sheeler is leaving mumford i am sorry to hear that
as you can imagine my own feelings about this are mixed unlike i must say those of my wife
i do not want to hear any more today
why not
mr follett do you trust me or do not you
well i do not know i only been seeing you
without trust there s no point to any of this you might as well not come
now hold on i did not say i did not want to come

mr follett
cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixen s smile and i knew
why i am paying for this
not for this not me you are not
you find it distasteful do not you
it does not matter how i feel about it it is how you feel about it that matters
i enjoy it does that make me some kind of pervert just because a man has a rich imaginative life
you did not come to me because you have a rich imagination
i never said that
go to hell
i did not hear you
now we are back on track
you are so mean
it is a thought i had
should i open it now
what exactly is it supposed to do
you remember when i asked you about pornography
i find it degrading maximum gynecology and minimum turn on
and you told me that still there s some kind of imagery that is haunting you and i think getting in your way
which i do not necessarily agree
but you did come to me
there s absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you i am embarrassed to have
my pleasure
me too doc and i cannot tell you what that package meant to me
my name s gilroy i am from the state certification board

there s something i think we need to talk about
what do you mean
i think you know what i mean
no i really do not
i think you do
why do not you tell me
why do not you go to hell it is all a bunch of nonsense and you know it
the problem is you are a big fake you have not got a clue that is wrong with that girl
take a hike dr quack
good evening mrs cook
just who is here can you tell me
could i see sofie please
no you can not i would not know who to say is calling
well i gotta say mrs cook you are right about that
i would better not i will fall right to sleep i think it is too soon for me to be sleeping with you
back when this started was there anything unusual happening in your life a change of job of living situation a loss of some kind
hmm as in that is interesting sometimes with enough clues it is possible to figure these things out
even if you do not think it is real
we we would try several things but i need to see you a lot
i do not know i barely made it today
i will come to you we will try a little walking
i do not think i can afford it i do not want my dad paying
we will work it out
no one ever thought so you must bring it out
is it contagious cause everyone agrees my immune system s way down
maybe you will catch it
we will turn back anytime you want
oh boy this should be interesting
people usually have to get to know me before they hate me
is that the technical description of what i have got
is she against you getting help
we do not discuss it
something s bothering her
you have got a funny idea of funny
i have offended you
sorry i am done
cause i will tell you none of the others have tried this approach
be specific
uh huh
yes yes and definitely yes also i get confused
yeah most people have that it is confusing here
did you get headaches before this but you get more now or more severe
no not really they are about the same my marriage was one long headache
so the headaches may not even be a part of this
is that like a party trick
you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage
sometimes yeah pulling in two different directions at once it makes tiny little tears in our fabric
well then my life has been some kind of huge rip
i do not know if i am going to make it the whole way
it does not matter go on
oh there s something wrong with you all right especially after hearing that dream of yours about the roto rooter
it is pretty obvious to a trained professional
no that would be a good story but that was just the beginning of the end we went on for another year or so
brady peck s fourteen years old lives next door
and he is where
in the capitol for boy s nation five days why
i am thinking a gal could make a good living doing this how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old
you like it
it is all right
then you can expect me at 5 30 tomorrow morning
and this is legitimate therapy
therapy hell no i just do not want to do it alone
which thing
either one
why would you come to the house the other night
i thought i had something to tell you but it turned out i did not
my brother said you were about to fire me
that is one way to put it
i bet i know what changed your mind my mother she was so horrible you decided you could not desert me
i thought only action movies had villains like that
of course
is something wrong sofie
yes something s very wrong dr mumford
you are upset
how intuitive that must take years of training right there maybe you can guess what has upset me
no it is not something i have heard about you it is someth why is there something i should have heard about you
why do not you tell me that is on your mind
given that i am obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way
i do not follow you
i am saying that since i am doing so much better which i attribute to you i am liable to misinterpret some of my feelings
i think so
which show was that
you probably got the idea
you are not the only one
not me all my other my patients i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here
you deserve it
i know it please believe me i know that
i do not know depends i am in a bad mood
i love you more than i have ever loved anyone or anything in my life
anything just ask
what is your name
will you wait for me
we are only talking about six weeks
will you be here
of course i have not got the energy to get out of town that fast
in maybe three or four issues
weekly or monthly
monthly god how shallow do you think brad is why do i waste my time telling you this stuff
why do you think you tell me nessa
do not do that thing that shrink thing
it is a big part of the show
it is called pro bono
pro boner pro bono huh for whose good supposedly
it is my bit for the community
fuck the community there was this article my friends and i read it was 25 signs he is great in bed it was very fascinating
where was this
have women found you attractive
what do you want me to see
just chill for a second look at this guy it appears he is actually dead but gorgeous
if you do not want to have a session today it is okay
what are you talking about
was it something that happened at school
these appointments were not my idea remember
true should we stop them
uh huh
this shrink school you went to did you hear about it on an infomercial
he said which we already knew
first off he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes i told him abso fuckin lutely no as you can see
no again
how are you
fine okay pretty good i have been hoping we would meet i have heard a lot about you
nah scotch
far out single malt can i pick it
of course that is exactly what i want
have you thought about getting a wife
you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town is that right far out
i have a lot of money do you know how much money i have got
do not tell me cause i am not going to tell you what i have got
i have got three big ones
i am impressed i could not make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes
no no i have three billion dollars
this is exactly what i wanted
skip you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with
you would be surprised most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends they are busy it is not as easy as you think
skip you are the head of the whole deal here are they busier than you
do not you like this
hell yes i like it that is better than this most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like
okay then have you got a lot of friends
lily and i talk a bit you know lily runs the coffee shop
no i have seen her good looking woman
she is probably ten years older than you
good looking woman
lives downstairs from me she is got a great dog named for danny ainge
really i am the only person i know that likes danny ainge outside of celtic fans maybe phoenix
well there s lily
what kind of person do you have to be to do this
yeah guy s got some serious sex fantasies
uh huh
doc i know we are not supposed to get together till wednesday
that is all right that is on your mind
you are a shrink doc are not i supposed to be able to tell you everything
it is just a thought
skip knowing what you do about me
jerking off
sexual surrogate slash companion
a doll
you do not think i am insane
and that is your secret you meant like a trade secret
no doc a private secret it is perverted it is pitiful what am i dr frankenstein are not you repulsed
sounds like kind of a good idea
it is not
just you
it is time you did some talkin dr mum wait a minute that is your name is not it
does not matter you can call me doc
it matters to me
i can tell you anything else
what about everything how did this happen
are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was
everybody has a story skip
sounds like you have several
it was not the best situation
did you carry a gun
holy shit
you were messed up man
but look at me now
hey you have done good look at yourself you have cleaned up you have got a career
things got a lot worse
you and candy
that would be lily
how would you do it the new you
all new people start with that
mumford i mean why pick the name of the town you were going to
everything flows from that and what does not can be easily purchased
no no training
psych major
english lit
jeez man but you are good at it
i understand what it is like to want to leave a problem behind that is all most people are looking to do mainly i listen
see you thursday regular time
i am honored
you want my advice far out
skip you are a visionary that can be a burden
this does not seem a little perverse
there are a lot of lonely people in the world somebody s gonna figure this out someday
it is not going to be me i am giving it up
what would i do
skip you know that it is improper completely unethical for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients
i guess that makes sense
yes yes it does
i suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area
which examiner did you have i probably know him
wallace franklin from greensburg

i do not believe that they are just having a good time same as us
no problem but who s susan
she is the sweetest person i have ever known loves kids works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church everybody loves her
i did not ask you all that sweet pea i asked if you loved her
lynette told me it really tore her up when you did not call this week

no but she is gotta be at least a month late
does not mean shit get her to a doctor you cannot do anything until you hear what he says make the appointment yourself
but she expects you to marry her

as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of are opening old wounds
computer request security procedure and access to project genesis summary
i got beat we are only alive because i knew something about these ships that he did not
he is been there and has not found what he wants can you spare someone there may be people hurt
i can spare me
this one looks like a steward they are not warm but rigor has not set in this did not happen all that long ago jim
where they went saavik
then this will be your big chance to get away from it all
how can you think of food at a time like this
our first order of business is survival
it is like the garden of eden
and almost got tossed out of the academy
we each face death every day we are alive saavik
i am taking this bunch to sick bay
young i feel young doctor
commander we are receiving this is regula i go ahead
dr marcus good we are en route to you and should be there in three days
en route why we were not expecting you for another three months has something happened has something happened do you read us
all went well nothing has happened ceti alpha vi has checked out
the order comes from starfleet command dr marcus direct from the general staff
but genesis is a civilian project under my control
i have my orders
message breaking up carol that is wrong that is wrong
cannot read you repeat
repeat that is wrong that is wrong
taking genesis away from us
taking genesis who who is taking genesis
see you but cannot hear did you order
what order who s taking genesis
please help us jim will not let them have without proper repeat on whose authority
why why did not you tell me
the matrix formed in a day the life forms grew later at a wildly accelerated rate can i cook or cannot i
something spock was trying to tell me on my birthday
and bored i know but maybe it is something they can
thanks a lot no respect from my offspring
par for the course you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner
i do not think there s another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks next time we will design a bigger one
starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years i cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event
you do that and you will have murdered your father
i do not understand who s responsible for all this who is khan
this is just to give us something to do is not it come on
we have picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner
damn are you sure maybe the scanner s out of adjustment
i suppose it could be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix
all right let s get on the comm pic to doctor marcus maybe it is something we can transplant
you know what she will say
captain this is the garden spot of ceti alpha vi
i can hardly see
i saw it
there s an air lock
that is the matter
never mind hurry
what do you want with us i demand
marooned on ceti alpha v he is completely mad admiral he blames you for the death of his wife
umm and would admiral kirk have access to such information
i would think so sir he is on the fleet general staff
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis
to doctor marcus the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i
i see helmsman
you realize sir that they will attempt to contact admiral kirk and confirm the order
we were still there you dumb bastard we could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room
i am doctor marcus
she is making it up my father was professor
we appear to have plenty of time
how soon
we encoded four minutes
we will beam aboard and stop it
you cannot
uh no i should be on the bridge
are you running away from me
no i i guess i am not what you expected
i did not expect anything
that makes two of us lieutenant saavik was right you never have faced death
it was just words
but good words that is where ideas begin maybe you should listen to them
i am trying david
so am i my friends were killed too
i am truly sorry
is that what you came here to say
mainly and also that i am proud very proud to be your son
only half of you would get there
the admiral s son
do not you believe it
oh i believe it
i do not know
let them eat static
they are still running with shields down
locking phasers on target
raise them
where is the over ride
we cannot fire sir they have damaged the photon controls and the warp drive we must withdraw
rake her
full power damn you
i shall avenge you
what is the meaning of this attack where is the crew of the reliant
khan listen to me if its me you want i will have myself beamed aboard all i ask is that you spare my crew
that is a most intriguing offer typical i must say of your sterling character let me think
do not play with me kirk my hand is on the phaser control
give me some time to recall the data on our computers
i give you sixty seconds admiral
i have given you no word to keep admiral in my judgment you simply have no alternative
i take your point stand by to receive our transmission
here it comes now spock
still old friend you have managed to kill just about everyone else but like a poor marksman you keep missing the target
perhaps i no longer need to try
chekov who is this man
all is well sir you have the coordinates to beam up genesis
first things first captain kill admiral kirk
we will be going to warp speed
aye sir
just the batteries sir i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes
we do not have minutes can you give me phaser power
a few shots sir
i am going down to the station
uhura send to commander reliant prepare to be boarded
i am trying sir stand by
try the emergency channels
enterprise to reliant come in reliant
picture mr saavik
scotty let s have it
sensors captain
i say again this is enterprise please acknowledge signal please
we will beam aboard alert transporter room
i had me a wee bout but dr mccoy pulled me through
oh a wee bout of what mr scott
my sister s youngest admiral crazy to get to space
every young boy s fancy i seem to remember it myself very well mr scott are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise
give the word admiral
mr scott the word is given
aye sir
no promises mr scott on your way
he will die
admiral this is spock
engine room reports auxiliary power restored we can proceed at impulse power
best speed to regula i kirk out scotty i have got to ask any chance of getting the mains back on the line
admiral if we go by the book like lieutenant saavik hours could seem like days
i read you captain let s have it
not at present
right on schedule admiral just give us your coordinates and we will beam you aboard
midshipman first class peter preston engineers mate sir
yes sir
i see well shall we start with the engine room
the word is given warp speed
i am understandably curious
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality
so you said at the time speaking of which your prot‚g‚ s first rare a trifle emotional
she is half romulan jim the admixture makes her more volatile than me for example
than you yes i see that by the way thank you for this
it was the best of times it was the worst of times message spock
none of which i am consciously aware except of course happy birthday surely the best of times
the enterprise i must check in before your inspection and you
welcome aboard admiral i believe you know my trainee crew certainly they have come to know you
yes we have been through death and life together
to be sure captain
regula i is a scientific research laboratory if memory serves
that will not be necessary just take me to regula i
you proceed from a false assumption i am a vulcan i have no ego to bruise
i would best talk with mr scott first so that he may in his own words explain the situation to his cadets
how far
twelve hours and forty three minutes present speed
give up genesis she said what in god s name does that mean give it up to whom
it might help my analysis if i knew what genesis was
the power of creation
have they proceeded with their experiments
the tape was made a year ago i can only assume they have reached phase two by now
really dr mccoy you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn logic suggests
chekov s on reliant is not he
it would explain a great many things
raise shields energize phasers stand by to
who who knew just where to hit us and why
one thing is certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power
visual mr sulu divert everything to the phasers
too late
who the hell are they
it is all we have got
the prefix code is 16309 all commands from each starship bridge are relayed electronically each ship has its own prefix combination code
wait for my signal spock too soon and he will have time to figure it out and raise them again
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area
affirmative admiral
blind as a tiberian bat what do you make of the plantoid beyond
regula is class would it consists of various remarkable ores essentially a great rock in space
reliant could be hiding behind that rock
a distinct possibility
engine room scotty do we have enough power for the transporters
aye sir
establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you have talked with mr scott
be careful jim
not much admiral we have partial main power
that is it
best we could do in two hours
she can out run us and out gun us but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four
scotty can we make it inside
best speed scotty
steady as you go
uhura patch me in
he will not break off now if he followed me this far he will be back but from where
he is intelligent but not experienced his pattern indicates two dimensional thinking
or the one
i have an urgent commpic from space lab regula i for the admiral dr carol marcus
in my quarters uhura
yes sir
transmission jammed at the source sir
damn alert starfleet headquarters i want to talk with starfleet command
uhura if you do not hear from us there will not be anybody behind kirk out you gentleman can remain here or
prayer mr saavik the klingons do not take prisoners captain
permission to speak candidly sir
very well
i do not believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities
and why not
because there was no way to win
a no win situation is a possibility every commander may face has that never occurred to you
no sir it has not
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life would not you say
as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me
then you have something new to think about carry on
it is still regulation admiral
lieutenant self expression does not seem to be one of your problems
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
you earned it
i did not think so
you are bothered by your performance on the kobayashi maru
i failed to resolve the situation
there is no correct resolution it is a test of character
may i ask how you dealt with the test
you may ask lieutenant
humor that is a difficult concept it is not logical
we learn by doing lieutenant
energize defense fields
we are finding it please please you have got to give us time the bridge is smashed computers inoperative
there is no such regulation
phasers on stun move out
if stage two was completed it was underground she said it was going to be underground
stage two of what
the kobayashi maru sir
on the test sir will you tell me what you did i would really like to know
then you never faced that situation faced death
come come lieutenant you of all people go by the book hello spock you remember dr marcus
no uncoded messages on an open channel
they just do not want us going in there
at what
all stop sir
descend ten thousand meters stand by photon torpedoes
power levels quite low sir
mr scott can you get the mains back on line
aye sir
two minutes ten seconds
engine room that is happening
distance from reliant
aye sir
i will be in my quarters if needed but i would prefer
understood sir
dismiss the company
as you were mr saavik
aye sir on course to ceti alpha all is well
good i believe you already know my uh son
aye sir
i am delighted any chance to go aboard enterprise however briefly is always an excuse for nostalgia
i cut your new orders personally by the end of the month you will have your first command uss excelsior
thank you sir i have looked forward to this for a long time
stop engines
engage warp engines
trying sir
phasers locked
try again
battle stations
best guess mr sulu fire when ready
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
aye captain
i am aware of my responsibilities mister
now entering the neutral zone
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission
i will try captain
aft thrusters sir
course heading captain
ready sir
honors hup
no power to the weapons system sir
what did you expect lieutenant
he is very human
aye sir
thank you mr saavik
never sir
aye sir
lieutenant the admiral is aware of the regulations
aye sir
i exaggerated
that is the one cathy brenner
they seemed sure it was either alice or lois
which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place did you want to see cathy about something
no not really
you are leaving after you see cathy
well something like that i am sorry i do not mean to sound so mysterious
actually it is none of my business
thank you
yes i did
well i would really hope to rent it for
i would appreciate it i have tried everywhere in town and they are all full
sure you can have it where is your bag in the car
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store you see i had not planned on spending much time here
yes i know did something unexpected crop up
no it is not the cut that is bothering me
would you like some brandy
if you have some i would
i will get it sit down miss daniels do you want a sweater or something a quilt
all right
it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes especially if you are over near the bay
i think so
how do you like our little hamlet
i despise it
san francisco
how would you happen to come here
oh someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago
i suspected as much
you need not worry it is over and done with a long time ago
annie there s nothing between mitch and me
is not there maybe there is not maybe there s never anything between mitch and any girl
what do you mean
four years ago of course that was shortly after his father died things may be different now
a trifle
then maybe it is not different at all you know her attitude nearly drove me crazy i simply could not understand it
when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what i would done to displease her
and what had you done
because she was afraid
afraid you would take mitch
afraid i would give mitch
i do not understand
afraid of any woman who would give mitch the only thing lydia can give him love
annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman
no i do not think so she is not afraid of losing her son you see she is only afraid of being abandoned
someone ought to tell her she would be gaining a daughter
she already has a daughter
what about mitch did not he have anything to say about this
you get straight to the point do not you
i am sorry forgive me
i will be going too to help out it should be fun melanie
it seems so pointless i think i will go to sleep this has been a busy day my luggage
that is up to you
it is really up to lydia is not it
never mind lydia do you want to go
it is what you said mom mr brinkmeyer s feed is no good
no cathy he sold mr fawcett a different brand you do not think they are getting sick do you mitch
in a democracy cathy everyone is entitled to a fair trial your brother s practice
just listen to them
they are birds
take them
well i suppose
your brother told me
oh i suppose so
could i have a puff
i do not think your mother would like that
just a little one
are you coming to my party
i do not think so i have to get back to san francisco
do not you like us
darling of course i do
do not you like bodega bay
i do not know yet
if you do decide to come do not say i told you about it it is supposed to be a surprise party
she said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back east
oh where would you want the coffee
take it into the living room would you hon
that is the matter with them
that road can be a bad one at night melanie
did you put the cover on that cage mom
i do not know honey
why are they trying to kill people
i wish i could say but if i could answer that i could also tell you why people are trying to kill people
is she all right
shhh shhhhh
i think they will be all right honey
no it is lois
it is alice
try my best
i am looking for a man named mitchell brenner
right here bodega bay
yes but where
right across the bay there
that is where the brenners live
the brenners mr and mrs brenner
nope just lydia and the two kids
the two kids
yep mitch and the little girl
i see how do i get down there
follow the road straight through town until it curves off on the left that will take you right around the bay to their front door
the front door is not there a back road i can take
nope that is the road straight through town stay on your left right around the bay to the front door
you see i wanted to surprise them
down at the dock by the tides restaurant ever handled an outboard boat
of course
d you want me to order one for you
thank you
what name
the little brenner girl
well i ai not positive if that is what you mean
i need her exact name you see
yep could save yourself a lot of trouble her name s alice for sure
can i have the boat in about twenty minutes
it is nothing
i hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack their brain pans are not large enough for such
the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range in fact during our christmas count we recorded
birds are not bad
what happened
young woman cut herself
shall i call the doctor
i do not think it is that serious you want to sit up here
stop worrying deke she was in a boat
i do not think miss daniels is going to sue anybody
well you are the lawyer
we will make our own fog
let me have some apple pie helen who said anything about war all i said was that some gulls
one apple pie you want more coffee
no came down on one of my boats they could have been after the fish just as you said
no here s fine
where are the bloody marys deke
i had to acknowledge a delivery mother i would like you to meet
a what
melanie daniels melanie my mother
a delivery mother miss daniels brought some birds from san francisco
for cathy for her birthday by the way where is she
across at brinkmeyer s
miss daniels is staying for the weekend in fact i have already invited her to dinner tonight
yes lovebirds we could not let you
lovebirds i see
get away without thanking you in some small way after all you have not even met cathy and you are staying for the weekend
i will pick you up miss daniels where are you staying
i do not know what good that will do chickens will not eat
caviat emptor mother let the buyer beware
whose side are you on
i am simply quoting the law
never mind the law cathy you can start serving the soup
yes very
and certainly pretty
i told you we met yesterday
in a bird shop
no i only led her into believing i believed she was mother it is really very complicated
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
mother where did you go to law school
forgive me i suppose i am just naturally curious about a girl like that she is very rich is not she
i suppose so her father owns a big newspaper in san francisco
you would think he could manage to keep her name out of print she is always mentioned in the columns mitch
i know mother
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer is not she
yes mother
it is none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to
well so long as you know what you want mitch
i know exactly what i want mother
i think he got a little scratch mother
that is right we had a party here this afternoon for cathy her birthday
i got them all mother
when do you think they will come
i do not know
if there are larger birds mitch they will get into the house
that is a chance we have to take
maybe we ought to leave
not now not while they are massing out there
where will we go
i do not know yet i think we will be safe here let s bring that wood in
what happens when we run out of wood
you do not know you do not know when will you know when we are all dead like annie
i am sorry mitch
oh my god look at her
get a rope
i know you can but i would like to
you are doing fine
i mean i want to
but they will be back
we will not be here
where can we go mitch there s no place to go
i want to try for san francisco there are buildings there steel and concrete
we would never make it they are probably all over the road
we have to try it we cannot stay here melanie needs help mother the house will not take another attack
if if when we get to san francisco if they are already there
they will not be
if they are
we will worry about that when we get there
i am frightened terribly frightened i i do not know that is out there mitch
you do not have to
no not exactly
yeah and the freeway s well lighted is not it mitch
oh thank you
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm
why did not al believe my story
he was calling from the farm mrs brenner
then he saw
he must have he sent for the santa rosa police
what good will they do
do i sound foolish to you
i wish i were a stronger person there is a long awkward silence she sips at her tea reflectively
no no do not go yet i feel as if i i do not understand you and i want so much to understand
why mrs brenner
yes i think so my son is important to me i want to like any girl he chooses
and if you do not
then i do not suppose it will matter much to anyone but me
i think it might also matter to mitch
i wish i were stronger do you think she is all right do you think she is safe at the school
would you like me to go for her
i could not ask you to
i do not mind really
would you i would feel so much better
i will just clear up here and then dress
did you close the door
and locked it
shhhh shhhh
we know what it is al
not by the thousands
no i gotta admit this is peculiar did you have a light burning or something
yes but the curtains were drawn
cause sometimes birds are attracted by light you know sure is a peculiar thing
what are we going to do about it al
i do not think i get you mitch do about what
well well these birds attacked us
did not know how he got in there had a broken leg turned out just fluttering all around there
these birds were
what i am trying to say mitch is these things happen sometimes you know ai not much we can do about it
eleven in the middle of the party some gulls came down at the children and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after
thanks al we will be all right
goodnight lydia
now hold it mitch you do not know that for a fact
we will use smoke pots like the army uses
that is all right
well i
bodega bay he goes up there every weekend
bodega bay where is that
up on the coast about sixty miles north of here
sixty oh
about an hour and a half on the freeway or two if you take the coast highway
yes yes someone s got to feed them
i am awfully sorry
yes i understand there are different varieties it that true
well yes sir there are
as the same time i would not want birds that were aloof either
no of course not
do you have a pair that are just friendly
i think so sir now then let me see
are not these lovebirds
no sir those are redbirds
the sign says strawberry finches
yes we call them that too ahhh here we are lovebirds
those are canaries miss does not this make you feel awful
does not what make me
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this
well we cannot just let them fly around the shop you know
i suppose not is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages
oh certainly it is to protect the species
i imagine that is very important especially during the moulting season
yes that is a particularly dangerous time
are they moulting now
some of them are
how can you tell
well they get a sort of hangdog expression
are you sure you would not like to see a canary instead we have some very nice canaries this week
all right she smiles back
i was merely drawing a parallel miss daniels
but how how do you know my name
a little birdie told me good day miss daniels madam
hey wait a minute
ahhh but i know you
we never met in court or anyplace else
that is true i will rephrase it i saw you in court
i did not break that window
no but your little prank did the judge should have put you behind bars
what are you a policeman
i simply believe in the law miss daniels and i am not too keen on practical jokers
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical
ahhh but i really do want those birds
you knew i did not work here you deliberately
i am good day madam
and i am glad you did not get your lovebirds
i will find something else see you in court some day
what made it
it deliberately came down at you you are bleeding
just some peroxide i want to clean out the cut
that is right what are you doing in bodega bay
do you practice here
no san francisco what are you
what kind of law
not everyone miss daniels
only violators and practical jokers
did not you see the lovebirds
you came all the way up here to bring me those birds
to bring your sister those birds you said it was her birthday besides i was coming up anyway
what for
to see a friend of mine will you please be careful
i am sorry who s your friend
well well small world annie hayworth
we we went to school together college
did you imagine that how long will you be staying
just a few just a day or two the weekend
i think we will have to shave the hair deke have you got a razor
oh no you do not
it is still bleeding a little here let me put this on
why would i want to see you of all people
you like me huh
none of your business am i still bleeding
i cannot say i like your seagulls much either i come all the way up here to
but you were coming up anyway remember
i was and all i get for my pains is a a a hole in the head
right next to the one you already had
look mr brenner
i am sorry i could not possibly
you are are not you
certainly but
then it is settled what time is dinner mother
of course how stupid of me a quarter to seven will that be all right
annie annie may have made other plans i will have to see besides i can find my own way
you are sure now you will not hire a boat or anything
i am sure
seven o clock then
he was watching a ball game on television
oh yes
will i be seeing you again
san francisco s a long way from here
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns
oh that rome
mmmm i like to swim we might get along very
in case you are interested i was pushed into that fountain
without any clothes on
with all my clothes on the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father s paper anything they said
you were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh
i am neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd
yes but
who did not much care for propriety or convention or
yes that is the truth but i was pushed into that fountain and that is the truth too
sure do you really know annie hayworth
no at least i did not until i came up here
so you did not go to school together
yes i was lying
did you really write a letter to me or was that a lie too
i wrote the letter
what did it say
it said dear mr brenner i think you need those lovebirds after all they may help your personality that is what it said
but you tore it up
like jumping into a fountain in rome
i told you what happened in rome
do you expect me to believe
i do not give a damn what you believe
it is for me
but not for me
what do you want
i thought you knew i want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked good night
i am trying to get you to stay for dinner we are going to have a lot of roast left over
i could not possibly i have to get back
why do you have to rush off that is so important in san francisco
well i have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing
you have a job
i have several jobs
what do you do
i do different things on different days
like what
on mondays and wednesdays i work for the travelers aid at the airport
helping travelers
what about thursdays and fridays
nothing i go to bird shops on fridays
i am glad you do
do you know what i was doing in that shop
you will think me very bold sir
no tell me
a gull smashed into annie s front door mitch that is happening
i do not know melanie look do you have to go back to annie s
no i have my things in the car
then stay and have something to eat before you start back i would feel a lot better
no thank you
i will get it
are you staying
i think i should do not you
it is an uprising
of birds
certainly of birds
yes of course he had to have a beard birds of the world unite he kept saying over and over
so they united
not at first oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks
well they will go along with anything
sure but eventually even the more serious minded birds began to listen why should humans rule they asked themselves
hear hear
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages birds of the world unite
take wing
you have nothing to lose but your feathers
it was like that yesterday
what do you mean
after the gulls attacked
i had not thought of that and then the swifts came
it makes you feel as if they are they are waiting or resting or
no they are having a meeting melanie your sparrow is standing on a soap box and
i am frightened mitch
no no
i am frightened and confused and i i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and and concrete and
at annie s house she is all right
do not let s take any chances
we have got to get cathy
the bay does not
how long have they been gathering there
the past fifteen minutes it seems to be a pattern does not it they strike and disappear and then they start massing again
it it does not look very different does it a little smoke over the town but otherwise
even the birds sitting out there it does look very much the same mitch this could be last week
it may not be last week again for a long long time
i tried a little while ago the phone s dead
have we still got power
yes i am tired mitch i am so very very tired
i thought they would have stopped by now
what time is it
almost two a m
you must be exhausted
how about you
i do not want to be safe i want to be with you
no wait hold me
we will take it slow until we get to the main road are you ready
i i do not think so if we get through town i think we will be all right
hello miss daniels
what do you suppose it is
you said three o clock
certainly not oh no certainly not this will be a full grown myna bird full grown
and he will talk
well yes he will talk well no no you will have to teach him to talk
oh oh well all right
well all right but
oh good oh wonderful
i have no idea
what oh yes certainly
no you would better send him may i use your phone
yes certainly
do you have any lovebirds
no not in the shop but i can order them for you
how soon
well well how soon would you want them
immediately is this the daily news melanie daniels would you get me the city desk please
i might be able to have them by tomorrow morning would that be all right
thank you do you know dan fawcett s number
birds are not aggressive creatures miss they bring beauty to the world it is mankind rather who
insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet if it were not for birds
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world
these were not a few birds
what were the crows after at the school
what do you think they were after miss
daniels i think they were after the children
for what purpose
to to kill them
i thought not birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx miss daniels a hundred and twenty million years ago
no one called it a war
are you discussing gamebirds now all birds are not gamebirds you know
i do not know anything about birds except that they are attacking this town
maybe is it impossible
no one ever said you were mitch
do you believe it is true sebastian
no i do not mitch because i cannot see any reason for it
it is happening is not that a good enough reason
i like bodega bay as well as any man if i thought
then help me sebastian you are an important man in this town if you will help the rest will
help how what do you want to do
i am not sure but
if you do not even know what you want to do
with smoke
can we go on living here otherwise
you and mr sholes seem to be implying as much
we need them
not if they are starting a war
they are incapable of organized warfare
that would hardly be possible
probably contain more than a hundred billion birds
which gulls mr sholes there are several varieties
the ones that have been raising the devil with my fishing boats
probably herring gulls they arrive in november you know and do not migrate north again until march or
of course
makes a lot more sense than well an attack
of course it does if we believe that birds are attacking why why next we will believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of
then let s go now
i have not finished my drink
put on your coats do you want to get trapped here
take it easy lady there is not a bird anywhere in sight
cannot you please finish your drink
all right all right hope you figure this out folks
i am fine
beat listen i hate to bother you
then do not
but what about starks
what about starks
should we be
should we be what trying to change him any way we can beat yes
but the jacket i mean should we be leaving him in like that
well what are we gonna do about it now
beat so they say off becker s steady gaze what
i am just looking at you does that make you uncomfortable
depends on what you are seeing
beat you do not believe me do you
it is not my job to believe you
are you kidding me he is not psychotic
then how would you describe him beth merely rebellious
in where
uncertainly in that thing the jacket
that was not a fucking restraint
actually that is exactly what our equipment is
pointedly of course you are not
do not give me that i know that is real goddamnit you strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer
i do not give a shit about your patient
i was not pausing to see if you did beat but incidentally you should because you are birds of a feather
sit down mr starks sit down mr starks
my business
you killed him
you sure you know where to find one
i have managed to every sunday of my life beat some of us are god fearing men starks
and what does that mean
means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we did not at least try to
you in here beat works like a drug
i think you know your eyes say you do
beat you are his son
i know beat you killed me did not you
no i did not i swear i did not i probably helped push you to kill yourself but i did not do it
i did not kill myself i died from a blow to the head how would it happen i have to know
i know beat i knew that when you came out
medication what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer
it was part of the treatment i intended i did not know what the effects would be
so what you guinea pig sick people to find out
the three of you were not regular patients you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove
no we were patients
no beat you put me on drugs and then you put me in the jacket
you may have known my father william starks
he did not either
oh yeah sure he killed a cop right
oh yeah what would he say
that is too bad
i thought you said you never knew your father
i did not beat did you have anything to do with his death
i never touched your father i swear
they should just be looking harder
later i will tell you about it later we got a session to catch now
i am one of the few things i remember doing is eating so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams
beat what do you need me to do
beat thank you
i cannot take you out of here in your condition
and i cannot stay here in my condition i am going to die tonight it is already been decided
no it has not
yes beat it has everything up till today is done everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs
no i do not i am sorry i wish i knew more
what about dr thomas becker or dr loel lorenson there was also a dr gries i think
unfortunately i am not familiar with dr becker and dr gries passed away three four years ago
mom he just fixed our car
jackie get in the car now
you two ok
our car will not start
yeah but i do not know what
beat that is your name
hey can you reach the gas pedal
yeah i will hitch a ride or something beat let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel
dog tags off her blank look they have got your name and date of birth for identification
what for
beat in case you get lost or cannot remember who you are
william starks beat thanks
beat i know it does not make sense it does not even make sense to me
if you do not get out of my house right now i will call the police
what now you are gonna show me some kind of driver s license
no i do not have anything to show you i am here from a mental hospital
well you belong in one
i am sorry for upsetting you beat but i am not lying to you
you cannot be william starks he is dead
beat what
william starks is dead beat i have been to his grave
beat what
his body was found new year s day 19 1993 at alpine
no you did not they found william starks body dead in the snow
how would he die
no it is not beat it is december 25th 2004
after i
i know
i know
how did they figure it out after i died
me neither who was the boy she was talking about eugene
i have no idea
you think lorenson kills you
maybe i do not know seems more likely becker does but at the very least she knows how i died
let s see if they have an address for becker i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with
i do not know
they told me becker s in shelbourne now i looked him up and he was listed
i know it was perfect beat erase my sanity and you erase anything i will ever say
i might not be able to
here drink this i will get the heat going
yeah i called the number yesterday to make sure thomas becker retired m would
they are not
beat lost no
there are no cars on this street
i do not know but this is not a dream i am real and so is where we are
then why is not there anyone around
beat i do not know
it is sunday
william you are not making sense
beat they are at church and i bet that is where becker is
no he did not
to the hospital
because your body can only take so much of what they are putting you through
112 orchard way realizing in a whisper you are not coming back are you
then where are you going
nowhere beat i just think i am gonna be sick
good how is your mom
ok i guess
you are bleeding pretty bad there
i am doing fine
it is complicated but looking at starks in a way your father let me know how i would get through to him
i do not understand
i still do not either even after all these years
i guess i would ask you why
because i do not think i am crazy
you are not crazy
that conviction does not convince me of anything until i know that i did it i am not going to accept that i did
you may never remember at all beat your mind s grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged
no the real events that have happened to me have been fucked up not my mind
i could try to make it stop
no i do not want it to
so it is helping
believe me i know
i never knew my father did you
yeah i did beat he was my most memorable patient
you thought my father was crazy
i was working with a boy named eugene
beat i do not know
but dr morgan said you were around when my father was
how do you know about dr becker
my dad wrote some things down before he died
beat yeah it is
beat we will
i will die either way
you have no idea that is going on
no i do that is what i am saying to you
listen to me you do not the jacket is my only chance in this place
come on tell me what you do know
beat i have seen a time that is not this time and i am only able to see it when i am in the jacket
well what time is it
it does not look all that different
the future does not look different
no not for people like me beat not in the places i come from
what about the world
i did not see that much of it same as now i only saw it as part of my own life
because i do not have time
why not
i am about to die unless i do something to stop it
and how do you know that
because of the future i know that is going to happen
william that is just another facet of my delusions
you told me about him i saw you and i think you thought i knew something about him so you told me
i do not know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions
no they are not my delusions look just leave my business with becker to me
you told me this was how it happened
i did
you have nothing to fear william
who are you kidding doc you or me
what for
you still do not believe me do you
i do believe you
no listen to me the kid eugene
listen to me that is all i ask
what are you talking about
you will figure it out and you will do good by him
sure it is an easy address a little far out there but easy enough
tv helps numb makes a crazy gesture any active mind sticking out a jittery hand rudy mackenzie
do not you go to jail for that
i tried something like 30 times there is as starks rightly figures no suitable response to that
i was not talking about anything
yeah you were what you said about them taking me out to the woods
cutting in mackenzie listen to me listen i am going to die
mortality s actually a great thing to be familiar with it means you are sane on some level
gravely no i mean in four days i am supposed to die
beat how do you know
the jacket
no beat i mean i found out while i was in it that my body s gonna be found in four days
so what am i supposed to do
is it true
i doubt it beat i do not think prison s so bad you do not want to remember it
where are you going
i am going to canada but i can let you ride with me up to the border
beat i am not deaf
beat thanks
i am not sure
let me ask you that again this time look around and consider your options
you do not have anywhere to stay
i do not think so
i am not sure beat i do not really know
of course you do not know
why of course
beat i was dropped off
do you have a motel or something money
no beat not around here
nothing getting up thanks for bringing me this far
where are you going you will freeze out there you do not even have a coat
i will manage
the best i could do with what was in your fridge
no it is fine beat swallow thanks
yup that is me
you like it
beat i do it
have you always been a waitress
beat why
beat real is overrated
maybe beat maybe not
you remember it
i guess not but as of now i never knew either
i am sorry
yeah beat how about you
yeah me too softly every day for the last ten years
that when you stopped being a nurse
what are you doing
and i will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the president john paul jones you do not understand a thing do you admiral
of course our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khruschev sees fit to satisfy
did you have any indication of this from georgi any possible warning or sense of motivation
so if there are alternatives that make sense and i am not saying there are we need em need em fast
we are split down the middle if i held a vote i think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two
then you will call right
somebody had to say it i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser
that is all well and good but what do we say to em
he did not have to worry about nuclear weapons
does not matter to me if i went down in history like adams i would die happy all they say about him today is
you mean there s something more important than votes did not think i would live to see the day ken
i know cia and the military fucked us on the bay of pigs
it is too politicized with you in there anyway they need to be able to stick their necks out
he is right and things are happening too fast it smells like the bay of pigs all over again
give it a rest you were thinking the same thing just did not have the guts to take the heat
we cannot do that bobby
you cannot take him out this late in the game
zorin will eat him alive
then talk to your brother goddamn it the two of you do not need any advice to get into trouble
that is gotten into you
something your father would have come up with
i am just trying to make a point this idea is that fucking bad
he better because nobody thinks he is up to this nobody
helen and i went out for breakfast excom s not supposed to convene til eight
we just got a second letter from khruschev the deal s off
what does the letter say
the jupiters are obsolete they were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway
so now you have got to talk him out of it and then we have got to figure out an acceptable political solution
and if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution
because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else
no ken i need to see him now
i think it is a bad idea
christ ken you know it is not that easy
yes it is
says what kenny
this is from the highest authority
yes from the highest authority there are two conditions the u n must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles
and of course the u n must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast
time is of the essence
48 hours in 48 hours there can be no deals
yes sir we can be sure we get all the missiles and we remove castro so this can never happen again
yes sir our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational the invasion happens eight days later
we have just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre arranged exercise sir we are looking at another week and a half mr president
still heading for cuba
all right then i guess it is time
we are not at war sir not until we are at defcon 1
the soviets are in control of the sams it is hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch
kids are supposed to get detention
i will be evacuated with the president
no i am glad i am home
busy but you have got his heart
i want an hour with him
i said his heart not his attention
three weeks before midterm elections you need me
well there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about
i am doing a piece on skybolt i hear macmillan s meeting with him in nassau
forget it scotty
let him talk to me he makes macmillan look good i print it the british public likes it macmillan owes you
tell you what we are in connecticut tomorrow for ribicoff i will get you up front with him during the flight
he was
i am giving you a chance here talk to me you can influence how this thing unfolds
well you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi
this is about cuba
dean rusk
wrong and you get to wax my car
i uh
what about you where are you going
back to work
no you were not
i was you bastard
today for your information is pulaski day we are going to buffalo
not as far as the election goes
acheson s scenario is unacceptable and he has more experience than anyone
there is no expert on this subject no wise old man
cheer up you have neutralized the entire white house press corps for a day
you do not show for chicago everyone will know there s something going on
i do not care cancel it
no way
you are scared to cancel on daly
damn right i am scared
they want this fucking job they can have it it is no great joy to me
i know i know
what about these low level flights they are starting in what an hour do you realize what you are letting yourself in for
we need those flights we have to know when those missiles become operational because when they do we need to destroy them
any problems you remind them those chains of commands end at one place me
have to hope it is a signal that he will back down on the real issue too
and we cannot purge the chiefs our invasion talk will look like a bluff or even that there s been an attempted coup
oh just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our jupiter missiles in turkey if the soviets will do the same in cuba
then somebody would better deny it publicly
yeah a good political solution
zorin must not have gotten instructions somebody in their foreign ministry s blown it big time
they know each other khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies
you are sure
of course it is but the president needs to realize we are going to have to stop a ship eventually
you sonofabitch goddamn it i did not drop
six months from now i am not going to care are you we will deal with it
sleep is for the weak mr president
mr president we are receiving reports that the ships are stopping
captain belay that order bob where is that coming from

was there ever a girl who did not like fighter pilots
i heard of one once
i am with someone
what if captain dawson had come with me
it would have been really embarrassing
how did you know this was my car
simple deduction it is fast it is pretty sleek and stylish it is your color matches your lipstick
that is all
and i asked someone charlie you think you are pretty smart
no i beg yours but i do not think you are right on that
why not
i saw one
you saw a mig 21
i saw a mig do a 4 g negative dive
where did you see that
it is classified
it is classified like hollywood says i could tell you but then i would have to kill you
not in this case charlie you saw a mig push negative 4g
yes ma am
where were you
on his six
yes ma am at first then i was directly above him
i was inverted
two meters
you know the finger
you let me make a fool of myself
and far too aggressive
it is combat every second counts
that stuff about the mig i was out of line
apology acknowledged
is that all charlie what else do you want
um you
there you go with those moves again
too aggressive
i do not mix with the boys i work here let s keep it professional
i am special
yes i will give you that
give me a break i am asking you out
i thought there was something that night in the club
maverick you know the rules of engagement
the what
some one comes up hot on your six what do you do
what are you talking about
you turn into him check him out identify friend or foe
i am not your foe charlie and if he is harmless you disengage
what if he is not
you have to shoot him down if he is smart he will turn away before that happens
how about anything anything you want to do
hard to argue with that is not it
a date coffee a drink a walk in the park
what about the plane
what plane
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit play with the levers and things maverick well get used to it
used to what
i am different
i am starting to sense that now
make what
you are an animal
that is true what are you
i do not enjoy watching things suffer
you are horrible
somebody does it is more honest this way you do your own dirty work
you ever think about killing another human being
about as much as they think about killing me
thanks very much care for some suchi
i do not know i do not like being out of control
and now i want you
you always get what you want
i do not know yet
in that order
well no inverse order
i am still second best
you ever fly an f 14
i do not fly in anything that does not show movies
why that is gonna happen
what do you take me for it is a navy cross
just good luck
where would you get it
pawn shop that is to eat
i am fine
this is it then
he was a friend of mine a good guy great guy it was my fault
that is not what i hear
i was flying my responsibility
that is what you get flight pay for
maybe i should not take it
why you act like you did not know one day this would happen
not to me
you knew it you all do it is part of it maybe the most important part
do what show you a good time
i am not good company i should be alone
i do not think so but if that is what you want
i want it back
of course the line s just imaginary you can cross it twenty times nothing really changes
hardly ever
only when you are depressed then it passes
it does
everything passes immutable law of the universe
i sit i think i play games
what kind of games
i like to play reality
it is strip reality actually like what the pilots always want to play
strip reality how do you play that
how does it go
you say the truth go ahead do not be afraid you want to win the game don tcha
what truth
the big one the one that is most on your mind
off me or off you
that is up to you
that was not fair it was a question penalty round
that is three
and that is one
your watch
who s gonna win
we will say it together on the count of three one two
i was later
long distance i would not do that to you i would at least talk to you
i did not want to see you i mean i did but i did not
i know exactly what you mean

you may not realize it miss kubelik but i am in the top ten efficiency wise and this may be the day promotion wise
you are beginning to sound like mr kirkeby already
why not now that they are kicking me upstairs
could not happen to a nicer guy you know you are the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator
i hope so would not you know they would call me on a day like this with my cold and everything how do i look
fine wait
good night
i almost did not recognize you this is the first time i have ever seen you in civilian clothes
how would you make out on the twenty seventh floor
great look have you seen the music man
you mean tonight
oh you mean like a girl friend
no like a man
just tell em now and then
this date is it just a date or is it something serious
it used to be serious at least i was but he was not so the whole thing is more or less kaputt
well in that case could not you
i am afraid not i promised to have a drink with him he is been calling me all week
oh i understand
what time does the show go on
eight thirty
well i could meet you at the theatre if that is all right
all right that is wonderful it is the majestic 44th street
meet you in the lobby okay
what cold and after the show we could go out on the town i have been taking from arthur murray
so i see
they got a great little band at el chico in the village it is practically around the corner from where you live
sounds good how do you know where i live
a couple of months ago i looked up your card in the group insurance file
eight thirty
thank you i thought you were avoiding me
what gave you that idea
in the last six weeks you have only been in my elevator once and then you did not take your hat off
well as a matter of fact i was rather hurt when you stood me up that night
i do not blame you it was unforgivable
i forgive you
you should not
i should not drink when i am driving
you are so right
why not they seem friendly enough
nothing there are just too many people here
no i like it
really you mean you would not be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this
of course not
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side is that better
much better
i understand christmas family and all that
i would better get back to my elevator i do not want to be fired
oh you do not have to worry about that i have quite a bit of influence in personnel you know mr sheldrake
you do not think it is tilted a little too much
the mirror it is broken
i know i like it this way makes me look the way i feel
oh yes just a minute if you do not mind this is sort of personal
all right have a nice christmas
oh yes office party miss olsen
that is right i told you we had a fight that is what it was about miss olsen you know that other girl you saw
i do not understand
miss kubelik you should not be out of bed
i did not know i had no idea this was your apartment
let me help you
what kind of talk is that so you got a little over emotional but you are fine now
my head it feels like a big wad of chewing gum what time is it
two o clock
where is my dress i have to go home
you do not want me here
sure i do it is always nice to have company for christmas
i just want to go brush my teeth
oh of course i think there s a new toothbrush somewhere
no i do not want anything
i will fix you some coffee
my sister she will want to know what happened to me
wait a minute let s talk this over first just what are you going to tell her
well i have not figured it out exactly
you better figure it out exactly suppose she asks you why you did not come home last night
i will tell her i spent the night with a friend
and where are you now
in his apartment
his apartment
i mean her apartment
that is your friend s name
as soon as i can walk
something wrong with your legs
no it is my stomach
your stomach
they had to pump it out
miss kubelik i do not think you ought to call anybody not till that chewing gum is out of your head
that is why we have to be careful we do not want to involve anybody after all mr sheldrake is a married man
thanks for reminding me
he does not give a damn about me
oh you are wrong he told me
he is a liar but that is not the worst part of it the worst part is i still love him
yes i have got it do not you think we would better destroy it so it will not fall into the wrong hands
open it
that is right will you see that mr sheldrake gets it
i am not very good at it
i am let me get the cards
you do not have to entertain me
give what up
why do people have to love people anyway
yeah i know what you mean queen
i do not want it
pick a card
a bad insurance risk
that is me with men i have been jinxed from the word go first time i was ever kissed was in a cemetery
a cemetery
i was fifteen we used to go there to smoke his name was george he threw me over for a drum majorette
was he really upset when you told him
mr sheldrake oh yes very
maybe he does love me only he does not have the nerve to tell his wife
i am sure that is the explanation
you really think so
no doubt about it
can i have that pad and the pencil
what for
i am going to write a letter to mrs sheldrake
you are
as one woman to another i am sure she will understand
miss kubelik i do not think that is such a good idea
well for one thing you cannot spell and secondly if you did something like that you would hate yourself
i do not like myself very much anyway
pick up your cards and let s go
do i have to
you bet i got a terrific hand
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne like some
would you mind opening the window
i just want some fresh air
it is only one story down the best you can do is break a leg
so they will shoot me like a horse
please miss kubelik you got to promise me you will not do anything foolish
who would care
i would
why cannot i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you
yeah well that is the way it crumbles cookie wise go to sleep
for me
mr sheldrake
i do not want to talk to him
sure that is that funny smell
gas did not you turn it on
yes i was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress
you turned it on but you did not light it
are you supposed to
in this house you are supposed to
i was washing my stockings so i decided i might as well do your socks
thank you
it is very curious i could only find three and a half pair
well things are a little disorganized around here
as a matter of fact i am a pretty good cook but i am a lousy housekeeper
you mean to someone like mr sheldrake
i guess so

you are going to take her off my hands
that is right i have moved out of my house i am going to be staying in town at the athletic club

so that is it going to be
thank you sir

but this is the key to the executive washroom
that is right mr sheldrake i will not be needing it because i am all washed up around here
just following doctor s orders i have decided to become a mensch you know what that means a human being
now hold on baxter

mr sheldrake
i know mr eichelberger in the mortgage loan department last night he had a little halloween party here

i will pay you on friday and whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around
oh how are you baxter they keeping you busy these days
yes sir they are indeed
oh yes she is the best operator in the building
i am a pretty good operator myself but she just will not give me a tumble date wise
maybe you are using the wrong approach
a lot of guys around here have tried it all kinds of approaches no dice what is she trying to prove
could be she is just a nice respectable girl there are millions of them
listen to him little lord fauntleroy
instead of friday could you possibly switch to thursday you would be doing me a great favor

i heard you working in here and i just wondered if you would like a cup of coffee
oh he went home to india but as far as i know he will be back
pretty much one day at a time
good guess
my pleasure but to be honest i did have a slightly ulterior motive here i was wondering if i could ask a small favor
a favor
no it is not your fault the walls here are just so thin
are they really
yes it really causes problems sometimes it is like you are in the same room but if it is too much trouble i understand
no no trouble there s other work to do
you are doing everything yourself
63 chevy
i knew it
so how do you know the owner mr bianchinni
i do not really i was referred to him
oh really
no but caesar does he likes him says he is a good italian
caesar is your husband
oh no no i am not the marrying kind
not exactly
i am sorry i usually would call rajeev but i did not know what to do so i called mr bianchinni
he said you lost something
yeah come on in
i told bianchinni i would take a look is it that sink
no mr bianchinni asked me to do it i did it
what do you want
a beer
a beer of course
curious that is funny i am feeling a bit curious myself right now
if i say yes will you take your hand away
look i do not think this is a good idea
i wanted to apologize
do not apologize please i cannot stand women who apologize for wanting sex
tell me about it
you have to ask
how did you meet him
they took over a club i was working at caesar started managing it
he is a launderer
almost five years
five years is a long time
yes it is
the redistribution of wealth
that is what i tell someone when i am trying to get them in my bed
i am already in your bed
my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught she was always more honest than me
i guess i wanted to
i am glad you did
so am i
shit here we go
you did not want to see me did you
if there is one thing i cannot stand about sleeping with women it is all the fucking mind reading
what are you afraid of
i am not afraid of anything
i do not understand
i know you cannot understand because we are different violet we are different
we are not that different corky
how can you sit in that bed and say that
because it is the truth
is that what her daddy tells her
i know what i am i do not need to have it tattooed on my shoulder
what are you saying that you do not have sex with men
i do not
for christ s sake violet i heard you thin walls remember
what you heard was not sex
what the fuck was it
what about that guy this morning
you mean shelly
do not tell me you are a workaholic
no shelly knows what i am he saw me in a bar with another woman
i suppose he just wants to watch
i think so too
for what
you made a choice once do you think you would make that same choice again
what choice
if those quarters fell to the floor would you still reach up to that cash register
how much money
shelly said it was over two million dollars
wait a minute wait a minute do you have any idea what you are saying you are asking me to help you fuck the mob
i am but
you think i am lying
is that what you think
i am just making a point you have no idea what you are asking how much trust two people need to do something like this
i think
he hung it up
in his office i saw it this morning
does the case lock
like each other they hate each other
marzzone as in angelo marzzone head of the marzzone family
that is his brother
what happened
not much really caesar was nervous kept cleaning the apartment the first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear
johnnie hits on anything in high heels
has caesar ever seen him
he does it right in front of him
it is getting better and better keep going
scotch glenlivet i remember that caesar made a huge deal about it
the plane is in at seven so i would say about eight
any bodyguards
gino travels with a big man named roy caesar calls him the driver
poor boy has to work so hard
waiting in the apartment next door
an accident
shit oh shit
he will not
trust me violet
if he does
when i get the scotch how do i know you will not take off
the same way i will know that you went to scotch trust
not caesar
c shit i am sorry
if he runs everyone will assume he took the money
you will be clean and we will be rich
thank you
if you are this goddamn smart how did you ever get caught
i will not
i think we are going to find out
what happened
that is okay as long as he believes it was johnnie
what if he does not run
that means he probably will kill johnnie
oh christ i got to get out of here
we are almost there violet just hang on
i am still here
i was so afraid you
you do not quit on me violet and i will not quit on you
do not be sorry help me
i am here are not i
you are as radiant as ever violet
jesus christ pop you got two hours until your plane leaves
hey johnnie

caesar wants me to stay
do not worry about caesar i will handle caesar you just get out of here okay
caesar what the fuck time is it

two days ago would you have even hit me let alone so powerfully

good lord what do you study in history
my nails

it is natural a reaction to their presence to the unnaturalness of it it is part of how you are able to track them
oh wonderful my secret weapon is pms that is just great thanks for telling me
you will get used to it i am more worried about your tactical mistakes
you are such a wet
a what
not if you are careful
how can you keep doing this
it is what i was raised to do there are not many of us left the watchers
it is not important
i am curious is all
buffy do not do not start thinking of me as your friend it interferes with the work and it
and it makes it worse when i die right
as for example what
well there s my keen fashion sense for one
vampires of the world beware

do you still ride
not for years
so why do you keep the picture up you wish you had not quit
well i jerry the point get there what does it have to do with the president
nasa is going to kill the president of the united states with an earthquake
not exactly the kind of thing a secret service agent can throw himself on top of
i cannot promise you anything
you think i am crazy
i think you are different
you do not have to burst in here every time jerry just call and make an appointment
johnny dancer you have been in my office ten times how come you never asked me about that picture before
was waiting till i knew you better johnny dancer huh sounds like a racehorse
you bit someone s nose off
yes do not let s get into this thing where i have to repeat myself
put down the gun and i will take your statement okay
you are the boss just do not make me repeat myself i hate that
you were there jerry figure it out
switch the charts
i will see you tomorrow
what is
sure you switched the charts did not you
you expect me to believe what that someone came in here last night gave that guy something that stopped his heart
you switched the charts you tell me
i got to get downstairs the c i a they want to see your body
for what
you saved my life
heart attacks happen
arf you gotta help me
i cannot promise you anything
do not tell me you are naked back there
figure of speech could we go
that is how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out a lot of people are after you jerry
dead or alive they will stick me in there with oswald another lunatic acting alone
oswald was an assassin you are not an assassin are you jerry
if you are worried about the president call and warn him about the space shuttle
right sit up so i can see you
uh uh do not want them to see me
them who
change lanes then watch your rearview
as opposed to
people more serious about their work you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it
you mean i should speed up and try and lose them
i noticed
nothing is easy
how long have we known each other jerry
six months eleven days
yeah i think so
oh well maybe to the untrained eye hmm ahh ooooo
i have no idea
i am not sure i think i figured something out it must have been in my newsletter
what newsletter
you are certifiable
you would not be sitting here if you did not halfway believe me
believe you about what
flesh wound no big deal
surprise me
the whole kit and caboodle of em are british intelligence agents spies jerry garcia had a double o rating just like james bond
um coffee if that is okay
this would be it
are these yours
the space shuttle s seismic secret the oliver stone george bush connection oliver stone
absolutely not a good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy if you can figure it out they screwed it up
yeah how many subscribers do you have
just five it is the economy you think maybe one of them is not who they seem
you got a list
never heard of him
you have ten copies of the book but you do not know who the main character is
getting rid of my hub
uh huh
has this happened to you before
never but i have been practicing
who are you jerry
just a guy trying to put out a fire
so that is the question
how is it possible
is this your dad
that was him
is he dead
please put it down
how would he die
he was murdered
not this again
fuck you i know you are crazy but fuck you
what van
never mind you would think i was making it up
where would you get your subscribers
i put an ad on a computer bulletin board i log on at the library so i cannot be traced
well i have been tracking them down all morning
you have not been bothering them have you
they are dead four out of five anyhow all in the last 24 hours one car accident two heart attacks and a stroke
realized what
henry finch that they monitor everything that it was only a matter of time and now four people are dead
latest casualty ernest harriman you heard of him
sure one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago
his obituary was in every paper but not one of them said he was murdered
it said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool in newport
nobody dies in newport they could not even kill sunny von bulow there harriman drowned but it was not in newport
where then
they are big details jerry
do you watch the news read the paper last week this whole place was underwater
a water main broke
you will
if that is what you want yes
oh christ here it comes look i know you think i am crazy i do not think i am but
jerry i
what if i reached a point where you did not think i was crazy anymore if i was normal
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking coca cola again
yeah would you i mean could you love me then if i was normal maybe
do not do this to yourself jerry you do not love me
holes i do not know what you are talking about
yesterday you were wondering about the wall how it was possible
now s not really the time to get into this
it is geronimo love it lets you see things it gives you insight i have loved you since the first time i saw you
i do not i know you would not
i thought you why love ruins everything does not it
it would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you but first things first
there s a car following us probably another one flanking us the next street over
not today
this way
where are we going jerry
how come serial killers have two names but lone gunman assassins have three john wilkes booth mark david chapman lee harvey oswald
john hinkley the guy who shot reagan he only had two names
reagan did not die if he had died everybody would know what johnny s middle name was
come on
is that what they told you
did you kill my father
he gave it to me
i do not understand
where were you the day he died
at a horse show
that is the last time you rode is not it do you think it was your fault is that why
did you kill my father
then tell me what happened
because he believed me
your father he was dying he was worried about you he took your picture out to look at it he called you his baby
you do
they will trace it
i am sorry
it is okay you you thought i was bad
jerry jerry

that is great good for you
who have you been talking to jerry who else knows what you know
could you be a little more specific
lysergic acid diethylamide with a little kicker of my own surely it must be coming back to you by now
you have never seen her run
then i cannot be hurt anymore
you are welcome where is my partner
you should think of me as liza sutton s guardian angel
that is ironic because we are here to protect her from you
you are here because you figured i might show up
it seemed like a possibility what about your intentions are they honorable
i am leaning toward no
we got someone watching her 24 hours a day she
that is not what i mean i want to see her
i do not know
then screw you i will rot
alright you can see her but she cannot see you
a dog bit it
excuse me
you were going to ask about my nose the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today
and you feel bad for it
it was my dog let me ask you a question how long have you been acquainted with jerry
you already asked me that why do you insist on making me repeat myself
and you have no idea where he lives
you have asked me that one three times
why you
honestly i think he has a crush on me
a charming term now why him
excuse me
jerry s visits to your office why do you tolerate them why him
the truth shall make you free
that is it i went to yale i hope you will not hold that against me
only on the football field
we are very specialized
brain washing mind control that sort of thing
fine what the hell is going on
please sit
it was mind control manchurian candidate kind of stuff right
a vulgar pop term but yes take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin that was our goal
ask what you can do for your country that kind of thing
m k ultra was terminated in 1973 but not the research it was renamed ex catcher

it was it was
and what did i say
a dog
my dog one i intend to put to sleep extrapolate from there
these things you are talking about you did them to jerry
yes that is right
jerry is dangerous jerry has killed
i do not believe you
you do recognize it then
it was my father s kept it in his wallet he was murdered
i know the story a federal judge he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial

he is why i watch jerry jerry s the bait for jonas
he is shown himself why have not you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do
jonas builds assassins for a living several of whom may be in place already we would like to kill a few birds with one stone
where do you think jerry is
no idea honest what are you going to do
i am going to find him because he would find me
do not go home and do not go to work either one could be bad
what do you suggest

i do not think so
how is the arm still sore

li mu bai is coming to stay the night
i will go and make up his room
i did not have the heart
well li mu bai can do it
wait i am a friend
why were you spying on the yus
i do as i please
that is it to you
like most things i am nothing it is the same for this sword all of it is simply a state of mind
stop talking like a monk just fight
then tell me where jade fox is
on guard
real sharpness comes without effort
i have always wanted a disciple worthy of wudan s secrets
and if i use them to kill you
that is a risk i am willing to take deep down you are good even jade fox could not corrupt you
that is it to you
my name is li mu bai the green destiny is mine jade fox cannot be your master where did you learn that xuan piu move
i am just playing around
tell me who is your master
let s go
why are you still here you killed a policeman you should leave you will bring ruin on my whole family
you are already a thief
that was just for fun how can i leave where would i go
wherever we want we will get rid of anyone in our way even your father
shut up
it is the giang hu fighter lifestyle kill or be killed exciting is not it
i owe you nothing
yes you do you are still my disciple
i studied the diagrams but you hid the details
do not bother
you do not seem to understand
so what if i do not
he is my defeated foe
i have made you silk pajamas do you want to change into them
put them down
i heard you met shu lien today
do you know her
she is one of those your mother would not want you consorting with her kind
do not invite danger into your father s house
go to bed then miss has grown up and is getting married soon god knows what the future will bring
it will be just the same enough i am tired
autumn is coming i will shut the windows for you
i have a guest
exquisite you said it belongs to
my friend li mu bai he is given it to sir te as a gift
li mu bai the famous warrior why would he give his sword to sir te
you are too young to understand
you are a sword fighter too
fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we would not survive for long
i have read all about people like you roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way
writers would not sell many books if they told how it really is
but you are just like the characters in the stories
sure no place to bathe for days sleeping in flea infested beds they tell you all about that in those books
you know what i mean i am getting married soon but i have not lived the life i want
so i heard congratulations it is the most important step in a woman s life is not it
you are not married are you
what do you think
no you could not roam around freely if you were
you are probably right
how so
i am bored
i will write your name just for fun
maybe it is i would not know
about you and li mu bai
yes did you know i was once engaged to be married
no really
i am not an aristocrat as you are but i must still respect a woman s duties
do not distance us from now on let s be like sisters
then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage
yes from the west he went undercover and and followed her here
i am just borrowing some clean clothes i am not staying
i will give them to you
i was just passing by and wondered how you were
go back to them first then you can decide about lo
you know about lo
he really loves you come back to peking with me we will find a solution
where is he now
li mu bai has made arrangements he sent him to wudan mountain
you are working together to set me up i am leaving
come and get it if you can
without the green destiny you are nothing
do not be a sore loser go ahead take your pick i will wait go ahead
she used purple yin purple yin poison it goes straight to the heart
spare your energy i will be back
not another lecture on guard
let s end this here
only the sword will settle this
what i have always wanted to teach you
all right if you can take back the sword in three moves i will go with you
give it back
you are tired you need rest your horse needs water there s a creek up here
you coward
still in a bad mood at least you are speaking that is your name
it is mine it means a lot to me a barbarian like you would not understand
not true i can use it to pick fleas from my horse
by the way i am a real manchurian
i am sorry i guessed wrong i though you were a han
give me back my comb
i do not take orders from anyone
give it back
i am a man and now i have found the brightest star of all
let them look
it is trouble for me
i will
if you do not i will come after you and i will not let you off so easy
a faithful heart makes wishes come true
make a wish lo
it has how is business
good and how are you
i left the training early
why you are a wudan fighter training is everything
something i cannot let go of you are leaving soon
we are preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me
i am he has always been our greatest protector
i do not understand how can you part with it it has always been with you
too many men have died at its edge it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade
you use it justly you are worthy of it
it is time for me to leave it behind
so what will you do now
but something is going on at the yu household
what have you discovered
you always suspected she would fled to the west
i did not think she would dare come back to peking
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu
so i shall avenge my master s death after all
it was bo sir te s man i hear he followed the thief to the yus
have you questioned him yet
no not yet
but your men are watching over yu s compund
what do you mean did not you come back here for it
i do not know it was stolen until i got here
then why did you come
well we had talked
but it is not your sword anymore you gave it to sir te
you did your job well but this girl i saw her last night
i knew she would intrigue you
she needs direction and training
but wudan does not accept women
for her they might make an exception if not i am afraid she will become a poisoned dragon
it is not our affair even if wudan accepts her her husband might object
i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world but the cycle of bloodshed continues
i wish there were something more i could do to help you
just be patient with me shu lien
all right i will write you an introduction take it to wudan wait there for news from me
your hand rough and callused from machete practice all this time i have never had the courage to touch it
what about you
i will look around and catch up later
not a bad idea tonight we will get a good night s sleep at headquarters
jade fox drugged her how did you get here
we followed jade fox
that cannot be everything has an antithesis why not this
shu lien
save your strength
my life is departing i have only one breath left
i am sorry she is not feeling well enough to receive you today
i heard sir te lost something and now madame te s not feeling well
that is good sometimes the help cannot keep their hands to themselves it is very embarassing
sir te knows that even well meaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families
but do not be too lenient
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking
a murderer
yes the very killer of li mu bai s own master last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down
a female criminal now that is news
i doubt it this thief it very unusual
we must avenge mother
what does it say
we will settle this at midnight on yellow hill good the fox is out of her hole
father let me avenge my mother s death
li mu bai giving up his sword and his warrior days maybe he is trying to tell you something
i do not know
yes though i doubt he is involved in this
but the sword could be in his compound
then someone s trying to set him up we should inform li mu bai
sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter
what do you have in mind
the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs
what cha got bennett

that is he doing there teaching
no he is working on another book
do not you think he is too old though how is his health
it must be alright he is still running around digging up tombs besides he is had experience
i did not know that
ten maybe twelve years ago in africa the exorcism supposedly lasted for months i heard it damn near killed him
i see your excellency
let s see whose around in the meantime i will call you as soon as i know
thank you your excellency
it is
and i do not care what you call it i am not putting her away
i am sorry
you are sorry christ eighty eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit
oh not to bad kinda like the walt disney version of the ho chi minh story but other than that it was terrific
and you got an invitation
that is this
dinner at the white house
your kidding me what is it a big party or something
just five or six people
no kidding
oh circuit my ass he does not give a shit
why do not you let me
what did not he tell you
did not who tell me
well when i went to get the thorazine i had him to stay with her and oh i should of known better
yeah well i guess you should have
we have to start looking for a shrink
i cannot believe it
of course i did not
what is it
me too
sure you will not change your mind
no she was heavily sedated
it is serious
yes i am affraid it is
may i ask
we still do not know
watch out for drafts a draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria
you were expecting a deliver y that day
not that i know of
groceries maybe a package
i really would not know you see karl takes care of that
oh i see
want to ask him
never mind
i know that i realize but if a certain british doctor never asked that is this fungus we would not today have penicillin correct
when she is well enough i will ask
could not hurt in the meantime
of course have you got a pen
that is her name
really wow
you are a nice man
good morning karl oh karl we have got rats in the attic you better get some traps
all right then we have got clean rats
i just heard them karl
yes i go now
well do not go now karl the stores are not open yet
oh karl jesus christ karl do not do that
very sorry but you see no rats
no rats thanks a lot that is terrific
she is going to be well
karl if you put this in regan s room i want you to tell me now did you
no it was not me i did not
what man
no thanks karl
how are you today
fine thank you
that is good
yes i think so
it affects concentration
what is it a tranquilizer
a stimulant
stimulant she is higher than a kite right now
do you think i should take her to see a psychiatrist
oh no i would wait and see what happens with the ritalin i think that is the answer wait two or three weeks
and those lies she is been telling
have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities
wait a minute what are you talking about
well she let loose quite a string while i was examining her mrs macneil
you are kidding like what
well i would say her vocabulary s rather extensive
well what for example i mean give me a for instance
well specifically mrs macneil she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt
she used those words
she used those words look i doubt that she even understood what she was saying
yeah i guess maybe not you do not think a psychiatrist
the best explanation is always the simplest one let s wait let s wait and see in the meantime try not to worry
lesion lesion in the temperal lobe it is a kind of seizure disorder
look doc i really do not understand how her whole personality could change
the temperal lobe is very common could last for days even weeks it is not rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour
hey do me a favour will ya tell me something good
do not be alarmed if it is a lesion in a way she is fortunate all we have to do is remove the scar
what was going on in there how could she jump off the bed like that
no of course not nothing like that
are you sure
well of course i am sure i would tell you christ i do not even smoke grass
are you planning to be home soon la i mean
please go away
i am father karras
that is okay i should have told you i would not be in uniform
yeah it would have helped have you gotta cigarette father
it is the other way around the society sent me through med school
you are a friend of father dyer right
yes am
pretty close
pretty close
did he tell you about my party
sure did
about my daughter
no i did not know you had one
he did not mention
he did not mention her
priests keep pretty tight mouthed then
that depends
on what
the priest
you would not
no i would not but i would try to persuade him to turn himself in
and how do you go about getting an exorcism
i beg your pardon
if a person was possessed by a demon of some kind how do you go about getting an exorcism
well the first thing i would do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century
i did not get you
well it just does not happen anymore mrs macneil
oh yeah since when
why i do not understand
to begin with it could make things worse
but how
well before the church approves an exorcism it conducts an investigation to see if it is warranted that takes time in the meantime
you could do it yourself
no i could not i have to have church approval and frankly that is rarely given
could you see her
yes i could i could see her as a psychiatrist
oh will you help her just help her
nothing you could do would make it any worse
i cannot do it i need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession
like what
like her speaking in a language that she is never known or studied
what else
i do not know i will have to look it up
i thought you were supposed to be an expert
yes i did i am sorry
no is regan aware of it
not at all why would you ask
it is not important good night
are you sure
it is fine really sit
in europe
have you told him that is happening
that is the difference
holy water s blessed and that does not help support a case for possession
um stuff
what kind of stuff
well me and sharon played a game in the back yard and we had a picnic down by the river
really what kind was it a mair or guilding
think it was a guilding it was grey oh it was so beautiful the guy let me ride it all around
your kidding
when can i have one
we will see regan now about those party invitations
you like it

i have seen him
you have seen him you are also familiar with how last week he died
only what i read in the papers
papers tell me what do you know about the subject of witchcraft from the witching end not the hunting
i once did a paper on it
i know i read it these desecration s in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft
maybe some rituals used in black mass maybe
and dennings you read how he died
yeah a fall
it is possible possible however…
you think the killer and the desecrator are the same
maybe somebody crazy someone with a spite against the church some unconscious rebellion perhaps
sick priest is that it
ah doctor s ethics if you knew you would not tell huh
no i probably would not
no i mentioned it only in passing
incidentally i mention only in passing that i could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession
very much
i get passes to the best shows in town mrs k though she gets tired and never likes to go
that is to bad
who s in it debbie reynolds desdemona and othello groucho marx you are happy

they never should have voted against u s statehood the scumbags we heard you got wasted
you look great castor really here i got a shot of your favorite mescal even has the worm
not unless you are sent to the clinic
you mean if i get sick
he hit a guard
yeah real fine especially all the casualties
i am complimenting you cannot you ever just say thanks
sorry admiral it was not mentioned in the job description
jon he is hooked up to a full spectrum polygraph no one has ever beaten
i do not care he is manipulating it that bomb has been built and it is out there somewhere
what do you expect us to do shut down the city evacuate two million people on a hunch
yeah me
my place
you should not have brought me here it is dangerous
better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery trust me caz you will not be here long
should be it is yours
of course he is he is yours too
five no one knows you are his father i thought someone might want to hurt him just to hurt you
you are not holding him right caz
yes pollux bought one along with the original batch obviously he found a way to make more
why would he need more
he is your brother you figure it out maybe he made another bomb
or reactivated the first one
right like jon archer would ever let that happen
you shoot hoops like a chick you smoke like a wuss and i do not know you are different
let me have a look
i do not know everything s jumbled so you are going to have to help me fill in a few blanks
a few blanks like what
after that you promised you would always take care of me
and i bet i have kept that promise
only one you have never broken
that is worse than losing five million bucks
being stuck in this rat hole when it blows bro what you built was a work of art that little fucker belongs in the smithsonian
for what
for being one helluva guy
thanks i guess they really did fuck you up
everything i say is wrong i cannot talk to her anymore
she is only 12 some day she will understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying i love you
is that what you think
jon we just remember how it used to be you staying for a while or is this just a piss stop
we need to talk
i am late for surgery
it is important
so is finishing my residency and passing my boards
something good
we were back in high school you wanted to join the sky diving team but i would not let you
must have been after we got engaged
actually in this dream i was your mother
so you had a nightmare
totally you were being very very bad you went up in the plane and jumped out you had a parachute but it did not open
were you there to catch me
i do not know maybe because you have never needed my help
and you would not be
one last time it is important
you said you would be here you promised me you promised jamie what could be more important than that
i cannot tell you except only i can do it
you want me to tell you it is okay to leave okay go on go
eve listen carefully the man you think is your husband is not
never mind that just take jamie and get out of that house do not tell anyone where you are going especially not him just go
okay you are having an emotional crisis you need to seek the help of a trained
think about it eve everything he is done recently has been peculiar right he is said and done things your husband would never do
whoever you are do not call again
do not hang up
i called but i am not castor i am your husband
why point it at me i am the real thing
i do not know that maybe jon s already dead
what more proof do you need
tell me what happened on april 9th 13 years ago
our pacific rim stations these numbers must be bounties castor s not wasting any time
what do you mean
he is going to kill off our bureau chiefs one by one
jon what is it
the bomb he is reactivated it and everyone there is going to die
cannot we call someone admiral lazarro
i know lazarro the first person she would call is me we cannot take the chance of tipping castor off
jon if i am not there he will be tipped off i will get rid of jamie but you and i are in this together
no life signs at all he is a turnip
that is what they always say
would it
damn right
apparently fine he is coming into work that is the good news
go on
castor s still alive technically he is a turnip on total life support
he would see that a mile away the only person he would talk to about that bomb is his brother unfortunately turnips cannot talk
the left i think those surgeons in witness protection can fix things nobody s even broken yet
she does not know and she never will
either way come saturday morning i am pulling you the hell out of there
call lazarro castor just came out of his coma
just make sure you are there on time
like gangbusters doc okay i missed the last one
you missed the last three including her birthday your wife s gripe sheet
i have been working night and day i have not had time
i just asked you about making love to your wife and you started talking about your job
i am not hiding in my work if that is what you are saying
you said it jon not me
and how much will your fun net you this time
you are under arrest incredibly you still have the right to remain silent
do not count on it
it cannot be it is impossible
let s not confuse things anymore i am archer you are castor but if you need proof
too late your kid worships me and your wife she is an animal even i cannot keep up with her
vacuum sealed globe should not take long
five seconds
not if i kill you first
so s a noose now keep your mouth shut
i am going to have you fired
pollux is what
archer cut him a deal for turning state s evidence he is free
walton you have to let me see the warden
or what you will have me fired
trust me he is already here get going
what makes you so sure this guy s gonna set up his own brother
i have never been more certain of anything get everyone in position and get the word out shoot to kill
that is the matter with your voice commander
castor troy almost strangled me to death where the hell were you
i will not tell mom if you do not
when did you start smoking
you will be seeing a lot of changes around here daddy s a new man
like you know anything about it
you have not changed at all some guy tries to rape me and you side with him
i mean like protection
well i saw you kim

let s try to be a little less formal from now on shall we
get rid of them

what the fuck do you think happened castor troy just shot him what are you waiting for go
where should i be where is everyone else
backing you up did not you track castor to the army street terminal
obviously someone else knows it get everybody back to their posts now
you cannot blame me for trying
business first i went into the warrants system and erased your records you are clean in fact you are now on the informant payroll
you better get used to it that bitch lazarro is getting kicked upstairs guess what white bread family man is going to replace her
you are supposed to be snitching making me look legit
i am just having some fun
there s fun bro then there s fun
yeah it is santa s magic fucking village your present s in here
most of the current chiefs they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads
all of them do we will kill twelve birds with one bomb and we will be rich
good because i checked your salary and it bites how the everyday working class stiff survives in today s economy is something i will never
no problem
a lot of people think you are a snitch it is dangerous
like i fucking care i am not just sitting here
normally i would but today
you have made us look pretty good in the past week and the way you handled the press
just following your example
d c s very high on giving you the promotion there s just one problem
that is that
me i have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job
i had doubts too i always looked at a desk as though it were a ball and chain but something happened
done in fact i was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs
jon you are starting to remind me of me congratulations
what is it admiral i am under the gun here
i just thought that under the circumstances you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs
no most of them are in transit by now i am heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security
okay then i leave it in your able hands
what do you know about it
as much as ever nothing
it did not work out as planned where are you off to
the hospital
the hospital oh that is right you are a doctor ha ha
jon i do not have time to play games there are leftovers in the fridge
have fun at work
do not i usually kiss my wife
i have got to study
they say love is blind do you think that is true
would not be the first time or would it
you would not even sip champagne at our wedding we were underage you would not break the law remember what my brother called you
i am not going anywhere
you always say that then you leave
that is great
so you see i am not going anywhere unless it is upstairs with you
call me spontaneous
jon it is the tenth i know how difficult it is for you but we still have to go
i am late gotta protect and serve the world y know
the world can wait jon you are going
okay if you insist but you drive
oh that karl
yes jon that karl
i will have a talk with her by the way you never said anything about last night
that is what i would like to know she stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off
good because i am fed up
sure baby go anywhere you want but i have to give you an escort security reasons
back then who was not
wait a second you hated madonna did not you
i thought i thought you might be able to help me
yeah how
i had a premonition about the route 18 pile up i saved some people and now i think death is after me
nice work maybe if you are real lucky you will wind up in here with me but i doubt you will survive that long
well if you put them on the list they are already tits up
what list
death s list the precise order you are going to die in
congratufuckinglations that makes you last to go but do not worry once the others are dead it will come back for you always does
that is what alex used to ask himself right up until
i hope you are ready for this
i i
you were there
i can practically taste the water in my throat and something else the smell of flowers
then it was not just a sign it was a premonition
how you doing in there hero
what happened when eugene tried to kill himself out of turn
six duds in a row
and when it was rory s turn to die and thomas was in the way
i do not think so alex s premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it
no it is not here this one was different more like the pile up and the van going into the lake
speed up
yeah fuck em no offense
i was dead and came back to life an eeg machine where is eugene
i have to save eugene
should we knock
he probably already knows we are coming
taken care of
if only alex and i had done that with the others alex might still be
do not sweat it it is over
she had the baby
random sure
what you think death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago you are nuts
your entire world view just went out the window i could not expect a religious conversation overnight we will get through this i promise
being alive after our time caused an outward ripple a rift in death s design
that lucky bastard
what about the rest of you kimberly you were driving to daytona was route 18 your first choice
what about you kimberly did you anyone from flight
blow me
yeah you should have specified
yeah who does he think he is knight rider
blow me yellow means go kimberly
blow me yellow means go kimmy
of course not that would be irresponsible and unprofessional
i thought we were finished with this bullshit this is police work not the psychic hot line
good cause we just got some new info and i do not need you getting freaky on me
hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by monday morning
jorge when i get out of here i am going to sue his cheating ass off
take my van
i have got to stop and help those people
do you want to deliver this baby
maybe that is this about
may we come in
no that is this about
what was the fight about
take a guess
does she have a cell phone a way we can contact her
she did
yeah i hate to love and leave ya but i have been over this x files shit since the sixth season
just shut the fuck up and maybe you will live
eighteen and it is hebrew
anyway i guessed it right and won these
i never mad it the greyhound bus i was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop
there s going to be a pile up logs bodies everywhere i saw it happen it happened
alright miss calm down i just need this lane open i need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder
you are not listening to me you have to do something
like i said it was like i was there i remember everything the sounds of the crashes the smells the look on shaina s face
do you remember what triggered it all
like what
my premonition was just like his
evan shaeffer s dead
then you believe all this that death is working off a list
clean up i do not
i am not following you
they are next on the list we have to find them
hold on
we have to tell her she is in danger
i did and right now i do not think she cares
who is this guy anyway
yeah i thought he was supposed to be helpful
how are we going to find her there must be thousands of white vans in this state
hey i am a police officer remember
are you thinking what i am thinking
how do you know
you said she was going to drive into a lake how can she when she is in protective custody
he cannot breathe damn it i think his lung s collapsed
do not worry nothing can happen to us
i was not worried about us
no time keep going i would not know how to explain any of this anyway
i know how it feels to be dead
i do not what if i made a mistake
impossible she was on the onramp
then that is the premonition of the lake supposed to mean
that is crazy you cannot give up now we can still fight this thing
i know i can feel it too
yeah do not make me cite you for harassment
no i am good
get ready to smile five guys per girl
i can live with thaaaa
how does a nice mature fuck sound

ruptured steam pipe
contaminated substance very dangerous shooting mud

that is where i peed
paisley porter i did not know you were waiting tables
elliot litvak have you been ill and mr rogan how nice
alla puttanesca

i do not want to hear about it
shut up elliot
quietly effective
press a button and they give us money
ride with me we need a haircut
she wants a divorce

that sounds so final but are we really surprised
i am completely stunned i do not want this to happen
but did not we know it would happen
do not needle me elliot tell me how bad you feel we are suppose to feel bad together this is what friends do
joanna bourne so rich and crisp this woman lets you touch her body you put your hands on her personal parts
asbestos lining
we must abandon
do not inhale
i can tell you the year the day the night the minute
you used to love life you do not exude this any more
what do i exude
suffering you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread
tonight you find out what it means to suffer
tonight that is tonight
shit they do not have any carrot soup
you mean because that is his name
you will suffer because he is in the theater and you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears
it is just a review
it is just a review do not inhale very dangerous
that is the fuss i do not get it
that is what i said eighteen months ago
what happened eighteen months ago
steven schwimmer i memorized every word of this review
that is awful
i recite it to myself with masochistic relish
a year and a half later you are still brooding
i said i am dead he killed me
do we care
i think we nought to wait
i say we go
you say we go
do not inhale
i am not ready
here we go
do not wait efor me
what about the haircut
then you should carry a gun
where is it
i gave it away i thought i am a writer now
that was a big mistake
no we are not
i am not a lonely spooky writer like you nursing a hundred grudges i am a man who loves life
we are talking about something deeper than grudges how do we respond to personal attack
it is your best play nicky
he will hate it
the american theater does not need people like that
shoot him nicky not that we really mean it but where does he live
keep going west last building before the river
how do you eknow
paisley porter
what do you mean
she was very evasive
what are you talking about
what are we talking about
yes what are you implying
did you see the winning run score
you are not making sense make sense
this could be it
let s work on it
let s work on it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
does it feel comfortable

this could be it
this could be it
i hear alan s sick
alan s very sick he has to go to new mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution
you know about adele

she died
i talked to her two days ago
apparently it did not help you know about peter of course
our peter
they are watching him closely there s a special rehearsal set for this afternoon to bolster his confidence and that is not all
i have got bigger problems joanna personal problems
that is not all nicky i have been backing your plays for fifteen years and i have never been more depressed
about what
steven schwimmer the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan
look all i want is a haircut i am not worried about this guy
ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater nobody in this business has been worried about anything else
they can send their heartless brilliant boy critic there s a much bigger thing going on than tonight s opening
you mean the world series i thought the red sox were winning
this is how we have managed to last
we are able to surprise each other
in and out of bed
because we are completely mismatched
we do not even like each other do we
the red sox blow a chance to win their first world series since 1918 you expect me to miss that for an opening night
it is all worked out they will lose tonight then they will lose tomorrow i see it with stunning clarity
it is your best play nicky
they will lose because they are my team
he will absolutely hate it
i go to college i thought you knew
do you want to get some coffee
i do not drink coffee daddy and this is not what we should be talking about
what do you want to talk about i will talk about anything that is this
why do you need a radio
so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer
that is completely crazy
is it
do not talk like that how prominent what are you implying
she is doing like those iranians i divorce thee i divorce thee i divorce thee
and he hears it the same time i hear it what happened to family secrets
because they get outstanding settlements and mother is determined that this time there s no turning back
i just had breakfast with her she did not say a word about this
do not be so steely eyed it is that course you are taking in criminology
she is kicking you out
i did not turn her into mother you did
this person and i are a thing of the total past i promise you
thanks daddy but i just need one mother s not going
opening night
i know why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition
take it yourself take a date
i do not have a date i do not want a date

names are incredibly intimate we barely know each other trust me on this
first you tell me
brilliantly moving
packs an emotional wallop
what else
a flat out hit
what do we want
mystery deception
deception is not something i personally consider sexy
that is sexy
knowing who a person is down deep
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking
you will not even tell me your name that is shocking about a name
it is your best play nicky
see daddy
i have seen it twice i went back tonight to be sure it is a brave and honest piece of work
what else
an artistry and sensitivity you have never shown before
and peter redmond helped immensely these pauses were exquisitely timed he made us wait and wait he built a gorgeous tension and suspense
two all after six
i want to be fair minded nicky

joanne bourne
alma wetzel

i want to believe
i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments

ken we have been through this
do not tell me you are still thinking of buying casa de psycho
hey smart ass i am up here right now in a luxury alpine retreat with a two million dollar view of the lake
you want to put in chain saws
no no listen when i get back to new york we will meet with the board
do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety eight percent in the last ten years
no but
and do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks crystal lake is filled with corpses
that is not true
logging we will need an environmental impact study for that
i do not think you are getting in the spirit of things janet we will buy whatever studies we need
just a deer mister biller part of the local wildlife
get rid of them
you have a map
i know but we left the main trail and i cannot find any landmarks around here i have been trying to figure it out but
you learn something new every day let s go
mister biller now that we can see the lake i think we should follow the shoreline to
help me with this
i really think we should go back
i want to look at the rest of the house
this is janet davenport i am the realtor
where is ken is he all right
what about that other guy
other guy
yeah ken said there was another guy there big guy then he dropped the phone that is going on
he he is here
who s there
janet goddamnit that is going on
jas jason voorhees he is here
i seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder one charges
that is my job
and we are in the center ring you sure you want to wear that blazer
your client is being booked right now he will be in cell five
what are the charges
compared to this guy amateur
who s chest
jason s it came out of his chest a hand with long blades on the fingers
video store
because everyone knows he is guilty
wrong jason cannot get a fair trial because of these
i do not know if anything s going to work in this case therefore we have to try everything
this is a legitimate cinematic genre just like westerns comedies film noire science fiction
a seminal film first ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement
great is that what you are going to say when i put you on the stand
insomnia not unusual for someone in his situation not to mention he is a bed wetter
he wets the bed
i always throw that in it makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant
this sexual obsession of yours have you considered going into therapy yourself
no need i am self diagnosed i have severe nympholepsy and i am a bed wetter
my job is not to determine his guilt or innocence that is up to the jury my job is defend him
i do not rationalize anything i am his lawyer he is my client that is all
that did not sound very convincing
wait a minute let me see that she hands him the file
insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes delusions
if we could prove that jason suffers from this disorder and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition
not guilty by reason of insanity case closed
how do we prove it
we are going to need at least two full rem cycles to get a clear neurological profile three hours minimum six hours ideal
cute waitresses
that is open to debate
i will take my chances come on i am buying
he is my client and this is important enjoy your waitresses
me too i am drunk
well i am onto something more useful you ever hear of a man named fred krueger
yeah what is it
it is a second rem pattern
that does not make sense
add it to the list
so what do we do
not yet
tomorrow if you can clear it with the sheriff s department
i was there once that was enough besides i have to go out to jason s house tomorrow they are digging up some new evidence
a cameraman caught him on videotape joe i saw an entire sheriff s squad fighting and losing against an enemy that was not there
checking out a theory just keep talking to him
how is that possible
except this victim got away i wonder if
i do not know but i think he is pissed
great now there s two serial killers on the loose
i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid
think it will do any good
and if he is not
then we are all in a lot of trouble
ten cc s of this shit and you will not be dreaming about anything
how long will the effect last
about ten minutes
ten minutes
if i give you a bigger dose it will give you a heart attack
let s split up you take the left side i will take the right we will meet in front of the cineplex
for the moment you have only got about two minutes left hurry ruby takes off towards the cineplex
my client is dead but i think he is a free man
arlyn he just wanted to ask some questions something you could help us about

please if he sees you he will not come
arlyn just tell me did jane have a dumper one of her regular johns
what about him yes

well well i am just back and i must tell you something quite wonderful
i do not love him
you have spent your life avoiding this you will try hard to deny it you are quite likely to destroy it
do you always have to repeat
look could i use your phone
yes indeed
look i almost killed my i almost killed someone
well i am certain doctor spangler will want to talk with you excuse me
oh well that should not take you more than another oh two and a half or three years should it
a few more days we know who did this
so do i
no not grunemann he is dead the man that killed him also prob ly jane mckenna also arlyn page
now there s a picture i would like you to
you said someone killed them you said you know who you said that
well we are pretty
why is not he locked up
we do not want to just lock him up we want a conviction we wanted him to do something more
is that why klute did not tell me
i guess he figured it was better
what was better i made better bait
no that is not
is that what he set me up for everything he is told me from the beginning do not worry do not
here please
like for you to look for the man
grunemann i have looked at him a
yes all right
we can talk

i am an investigator i would like to ask you some questions about tom grunemann
dew yew hayuv ah dentifikyshun
no i am look
or you will get me shoved back in the brig you mean another month with the bull dykes
is not that sweet well it could be any one of them bubi i get to see them all
what what do you remember about that dumper
i cannot say he was anybody
most of them
is that how you met the dumper someone else gave
how would i remember
how else do you meet them pimps
you are very square pimps do not get you dates cookie they just take the money
look i am sure this will amuse you too ilia trying to get away from all that
what about the old gentleman the other night mr faber
tell me about frank ligourin
mm oh he was my old man we broke up
i do not want you to look up there s someone on the skylight
i go on rounds
rounds what are they do not watch me keep talking
you go see agents or equity calls open casting calls and ad agencies commercials you do not get work you just go around
what do you think
cannot you get him
maybe if you tell me the things you have not
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper frank sent me on it
do you know where he got the dumper
he never told me
well let s go down and ask him
is that what you gave him
it did not go anywhere but that is not why
about the dumper did not he tell you that
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper
well she is dead
you said you wanted these
you told me what you could i guess i am through with your part of it
is there anything more i could
i do not see anything do you
what are you gonna do next
try some other ways
what do i do meanwhile wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me
and i do not think that was tom
you said it was
no i said what did you think
yeah you got to me
us city folks the sin the glitter the wickedness
oh no not that way i would say it was more i do not know too bad pathetic
it got lonely upstairs there s someone on the roof
not much point to this is there
did she and jane mckenna know each other
frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his travel time
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too
arlyn had a very big habit heroin she is the one who started frank she is strung out now you will not find her
you could help me find her you know the people i will pay you a hundred dollars
what the hell do you think s the matter i could wait for you someplace
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann
then you do not need me
but if it is someone else i do
what if i go out on tricks you wanna come along you could sit and read the national geographic
how can you do it to yourself
i do not get you
ligourin how could you do it
i told you before you would not understand
arlyn was a junkie i am not on junk
no you can find some other way explain it to me bree show me any sense to
no well all right but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right
i do not like getting splashed
what am i supposed to say
i was wondering what that was
hell there s nothing so mysterious about the square life
do not touch anything
drop it
my god i thought it was over and here i am daddy right back at the start
go down in my room
you said it was over right you said not to worry any more all over right
those were police laboratory people they have been over the apartment
oh zippidy doo they will find my fingerprints can i go in i need some stuff
with trina
i called trina
maybe i was not there when you called
bree that is actually happened it was not that bad
how do you know how bad it was
why could not you stay here with me
because i did not want to be touched i did not think you would get that
trask wants to talk with you
trask said i should move let s not make a thing of it
no i was going to come up i wanted to ask you to marry me
you wanted to or you are
i am
you could at least look at me
about what
look at me i am pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned and dear god i would tear your heart out
i do not think so
they do not scare me any more
can you use these
no i am sore
i believed her pete
it is where it does not get me i have got nothing left that connects to anything
then close the case
i better keep looking
where how
i could try arlyn page again she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer not tom you said the dumper was clearly not tom
it is got to make sense some way
how is it back there
well there s a couple
i read your report i had to go along with it the idea of this being a wild goose chase tom being nowhere around
well as a matter of
yeah two things pete that
you said trask was arranging laboratory work police laboratory anything from that
yeah it was not tom
i am sorry i do not understand
it was not tom that broke in the room
it has to be tom you said he ripped up his own pictures he
no no mistake pete it does not prove who it was but proves it was not tom
you must be discouraged
not too bad this brings back that dumper in the picture
that who
dumper the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew
you said he was no possible connection with tom the page girl told you that not tom
someone s been doing all these things
you were hired to look for tom not someone
pete i have got a chance to buy jane mckenna s black book
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckenna s list of clients
no it is ridiculous this has nothing to do with tom grunemann
it probably has the dumper s name it might give us some kind of new lead i want a look at it anyhow
tomorrow evening nine east river drive and 73rd street
suppose i meet you there a half hour before
just send me a money order
no i would like to be in on it
i will be sending you on a report tonight
it is a beautiful day in tuscarora i do not envy you that humidity in the city
it is not so bad
that is in it
no they never did really but that is what i am going to recommend the next step unless something
have you discussed this with them
it is in the report
do they have the report have you discussed it with them
i wanted to give it to you first
thank you goodbye john
goodbye pete
i have just got a few
i would like to make something clear i do not go after a girl a girl comes to me her choice right
they tell me you use narcotics could i bring someone around to look at your arms
look dad i may stand better with the cops than you
she told me
would i be telling you all this she copped out long ago she committed suicide baxter
not unusual
did she talk about him to you
about his letters that is all she remembered quite violent material i would say obsessive a quite sick man but that is not unusual either
has she talked with you since prison
are you with plant security sergeant
town police
then how are you involved
i know tom grunemann
you knew the subject thomas grunemann how well
we grew up together kids
can you account for his disappearance in any way
everybody s got some i guess
did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york
because he knew i could not leave the case alone and this way at least he would keep track of it and me
what about grunemann s letters to the girl everything like that
unknown unidentified and unwanted and there s more every day man there s more everyday
i believed her the dumper was not tom grunemann
i looked it up
i do not know it looks familiar to me
thought it might it is off an arrest report you typed two years ago man you wanted samples of everybody
unless he was involved with grunemann s disappearance
i knew tom never wrote that letter
what else do you know
i do not believe tom s alive
i left them here i was doing some work here
nobody s seen that
no sir we do not state that we are countin
klute offered us his services we have accepted
yes sir we know he
oh yes will not you come in

i see well you will have to do better than that do you have any affidavits to support negligence
i do not your honor however
this is an isolated incident counselor unless you can prove otherwise
does the witness deny the injury took place
no counselor i am going to over rule you on this line of questioning
then i have concluded my questions
six years
and would you describe those years as happy
the first couple yes but after that it became increasingly difficult
mrs kramer did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex husband
no i did not
did you wish to
yes i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer
and what is your present salary
i make thirty one thousand dollars a year
yes very much
and yet you chose to leave him
because my son is here and his father is here as a mother i do not want my child to be separated from his father
mrs kramer can you tell the court why you are asking for custody
can you recall any particular incident that relates to mr kramer s care of his child
no questions
your honor i am only examining the man s employment record he pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job
while the child was in the care of the witness he cut his face badly and is now scarred
eight almost nine years
and did you have a close personal relationship
it was good he was a hard worker a lot of drive a real hustler
and yet you fired him
mr kramer nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus
look you do not understand i need a job i have got a kid and
i understand and i am absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up after the first of the year
mis ter kramer it is almost four now it is the friday before christmas nobody is going to want to
either you call and set up the appointment or i will call and if i call you lose the commission
my we are a hot shot are not we
how many lovers have you had permanently

more than three less than thirty three permanently
do you have a lover now

would you speak up mrs kramer i could not hear you
we were married two years before the baby and then four very difficult years
so you were a failure at the longest most important relationship in your life
oh what do you call it then a success the marriage ended in divorce
i consider it less my failure than his
congratulations mrs kramer you have just rewritten matrimonial law you were both divorced mrs kramer

you have either got it or you do not let your conscience be your guide
something like that
you can be a thief and have a conscience
someone in possession of all the facts are you telling me i have to do this
generally i do not favor coercing someone not when there s a chance my life could end up in their hands
and that is the only reason
can you think of a better one
not me i was just hoping you might or that somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical
look would it make you feel better if i did not want you to do this
probably that i needed him in some urgent way destitute in serious trouble the kind i could not possible sort out myself
well i mean it is not a total loss it is keeping a very capable thief off the street
very funny maybe he has heard and does not want to know maybe he is lost interest
how can you possibly i have got to get right on the plane i am leaving now
you do not trust me
oh i do but as we know i am a very poor judge of character
he is got you on qantas flight 2735 it is going to be delayed
just like old times
just like old times
just about
michael his driver s an aussie new to me then there s the blokes in the annex at the back of the house
have you met them
bids from possible chimera buyers to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money
betting table twelve off the paddock nyah are you up to this
i will muddle through
you noticed what are you going to do spank me
why that is happened what did you see
ethan tell me
how do you suggest i go about it
oh ethan
i am now get me out of here just get me out of here
it is going to be okay
nyah it is very important not do anything to alarm ambrose
what you told me to get out of here i thought you were here to collect me i was so relieved
i was not thinking just trying to keep you from getting hurt that is all
i guess i lied you cannot get both of us out of here can you
no you just looked as if you did
do not be would not be on vacation if you did
well you are sorry and i am sorry
why did you phrase it like that
like what
you are sorry and i am sorry
you gotta be kidding
you were there
you know we had reservations about each other is not it a little late in the day to be asking me that
not necessarily
then you do think it was ambrose
enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers
the question is why what was this chimera nekhorvich was carrying
in any case you have got to recover chimera and bring it to us
in order to do that i have got to figure out how he plans to make money with it
right in fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts
excuse me
then makes sure she continues to see him gets him confide in her and report to you
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief
go to bed with a man and lie to him she is a woman she is got all the training she needs
you mean it will be difficult
but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera
you mean that leaves miss hall
yes i believe that is right now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure the victim becomes infectious highly infectious
are not you even curious about why she did it
no i cannot afford to be curious and neither can you hunt
you would like me to conduct my own debriefing
why not you have done just about everything else on this operation
i would thank you but i am not sure that was a compliment
and the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from ambrose
well bellerophon it turns out was only really effective against chimera
where is she now by the way do you know
i do not no exactly
well hunt what are your plans
not sure some sort of vacation i will let you know where i am going
oh you do not have to do that would not be a vacation if you did
well yes i suppose i am a bit anxious
they are ready and waiting you will soon be with old friends
i am with an old friend now dmitri
sorry it could not be under happier circumstances
yes i am sorry too you are sorry and i am sorry you do know gradski thought the world of you
yes he knew just
not in time to save him
no after you have lived with chimera for twenty hours nothing can save you not even bellerophon
you keep calling me dmitri you really should not
i am fine
put in the coordinates and let s get a visual the visuals are not coming up
the satellite does not work as fast as i do
why not
right i guess there are not many flu epidemics in the middle of summer
left jacket pocket
roger that
confirm left jacket pocket
left jacket pocket confirmed
nyah ambrose is heading back there s an enveloped inside
she must still be on the property
i told her to get outta there
yeah why else would he come back to australia if he had them both he could sell them anywhere
i kill chimera at biocyte and he is sitting on a cure without a disease
you have got the voice print i will get us in
nyah still on the property
all storage and production of chimera is done here in this lab on the forty second floor the heart of the building
no garage entrance lobby s protected by five guards on rotating patrol
oh uh commencing diversion alarm in cosmetics

copy she is only got twenty eight minutes left track ahead and pick her up
good job and thanks
that is happening here you are dead
you are infected with chimera my friend
do i
you took it all of it and what if i need it
if my my my the five hundred people on bruny island that you deliberately infected with chimera needed it as well
oh please how was i to know they had to be treated with bellerophon within twenty hours
by asking me
more or less

if they stay they will catch you and they do not have to catch you
no fucking way
mickey you are wasting time
you made every day like kindergarten
they cannot because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the knoxs so you may as well make the first move
and they made the first move
unfortunately yes
i do too
and a snake eye glare
and a snake eye glare arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him
he had the edge the mind s edge
mickey and mallory have that edge
only on a much grander scale
they have hypnotized the nation
schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along
that is the way of the world
they are shocking the world into remembering the primal law
survival of the fittest
and then mallory stops mickey and says hey these are the brothers hun
mickey stops sawing on my leg and says oh my god i am your biggest fan
apparently they have seen all our films
they were especially influenced by conquering huns of neptune
so mallory calls 911 and they took off
they actually apologized
capt n
where do the air ducts lead
it is hard to say capt n
take a wild stab
i will say enough to destroy this wing
the entire wing

okaaaay that car s going to bankrupt you
she just needs a new windshield wiper

rob please focus
little known fact
plus if you quit you are no better than me
better than i
that is the spirit
no josie this is real
and a gymnast
she is sixteen years old rob that is totally and completely illegal
thanks and what are
duh tom cruise risky business
i know
sorry forgetful
you like her
i love the way she writes
not the happiest of souls art is a form of catharsis and love is a permanent flop
but i think she wanted to be happy that is why she wrote i mean she was still writing about love right
true i guess she had not completely given up hope are you sure you are seventeen
sure why
because seventeen year olds do not like writers from the 30 s they do not even like people in their 30 s
well i am definitely seventeen and now definitely late
oh i do not think so
your writing it is amazing josie you are really talented and far less depressing than dorothy parker
thank you
so what are you thinking for college
college have not really thought about it
that is crazy i will get you some applications
oh no no no no no see my family we do not go to college we just go right into sheep herding
josie you owe it to yourself to go for your writing you are a natural
thanks wow that is really nice to hear
thank you
actually it is more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me
oh right the spiderman incident
you remember that story
of course i remember everything from your class
that is what makes you interesting as a teacher
you have to say that you are my student
i do not have to say that
i should not say that because i am your teacher
when are you going to open your eyes
i am thinking when i am home
thanks they were not related to humpty dumpty were they tweedle dum and tweedle dee
maybe distant cousins they did have that egg shape in common
but humpty dumpty was alone
that is sad is not it he had to sit on that wall all by himself he deserved to have somebody
that is really what we all need right someone to sit up on the wall with us
yeah to watch the world go by
to put us back together again when we fall
do you think you will find her
yeah actually i do
what but i was not even going to go to college
no i know but i pulled some strings got him to look at your writing and he agreed to meet you
oh yikes
told him if i am wrong about this girl you can take away my teaching certificate
wow you believe in me that much
thanks so do you
well are you here with anybody
no i am alone
it is weird because prom is actually from the word promenade and you cannot really promenade alone can you
yeah i have
no surprise i thought you would be
what happy why because it turns out all along that i was allowed to be attracted to you
you were attracted to me
you set me up for a story you know that is crazy i was actually considering waiting for you
but now you do not have to
i just cannot look at you the same way
i finally found my story
the poem i knew he liked the poem billy prince is asking me to the prom
that is what i am saying
i know like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid
nah uh
it is really hard to do some kids try for all of high school and never make it
we are very evolved
who are you guys
you so do not deserve to be prom queen
i am handing out a free lei to every customer what do you think
i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches
relax monty it is just my sister
thank you i am rob
well a ball player
yeah definitely
maybe we should sit
rob i mean it i want you to be my first me and you once the floor stops spinning let s have sex
my name s larry mitchell i live in vancouver
i am afraid there s nothing i can do about it mr mitchell
how far does this train go
vancouver b c
i am going to vancouver mr mitchell
perhaps i do not take it so lightly
where are you staying in vancouver royal it is pretty crowded you know
is it i expected to go to the vancouver royal should i have a reservation
i will make one for you i live there
i really do not know
you do not know
very nice mitchell turns
no thanks
thank you
suppose i had not known that immigration inspector had not put in a good word for you
i am supposing
not tonight
that is the matter
i am not in the mood for dining and dancing
we have some nice places around vancouver
i am sure you have
well how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o clock a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there
i have not been invited
nobody gets invited to clark brandon s parties they just go
i am trying very hard to be polite about it
would you mind
okay you win
if you change your mind about the cocktail party or anything else give me a buzz
if i change my mind
how do you do
why certainly baby
how careful should i be
just drunk enough
next time you try that mr mitchell do not i am warning you
how soon can i get a plane to seattle
i am afraid there s nothing more tonight miss unless you charter a plane
how long would that take
possibly miss
i am miss mayfield is mr campbell here
i am mr campbell miss mayfield purely as a matter of routine i want to ask the name of your bank
i am carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks how much of a deposit would you like
no please
sit down then we often have a double up here
i see
disgusting are not they if you really want a martini i know where you can get one
i see
it might be worth a martini to you
i do not need it that badly i do not enjoy crashing other people s parties
it is open house no crashing involved anybody in the hotel s welcome
what did you say his name was
no not very well and i like his friends even less but if you really want a good dry martini
as i said before
sure but i would hate like the dickens to be held to everything i have said before would not you
i never pay for anything they just keep me here to amuse the guests
and do you amuse the guests
no are you really going to drink that stuff
you are drinking it
i can be talked out of it as a matter of fact i would like a dry martini myself
would it make you anymore amusing
whatever you say
i did not say anything
thanks for the fresh air that felt good
you are sure mr brandon will not mind
he does not even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor
much too late
do not take it so big it is not a tragedy
not with my consent strange as it seems i do not know how he got in i do not know anything
sure but somebody always does
i do not
how did you meet him
on a train he said he lived here and he offered to make a reservation for me
nice of him
he knew the immigration officer he eased himself in
he was a great boy for that what else
that is all there is
i would rather wait until it does matter
there was not any plane
it is always a mistake to run away always
no thanks
he could hardly help suspecting you
that is putting it mildly
quarter after one why
there s a lot of night left to live through
let s not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us
certainly not to me
just who are you anyway
at this time of night it is not as bad as it looks
dance here
why not
they know you here know your name
i know everybody i do not look at half of life just the nice half i look at all of it
i did not notice him
we walked right passed him he is following us
killaine s not that sort of guy he said no he meant no
then he is got to be a detective
could not be
then he is
absolutely sure
we will find out
you do not know who he is
he is not a cop a cop would not have kneed me
he was following us but he is not a policeman
anything i can do about it
take me home and forget you ever saw me that is a silly remark is not it
try not talking
nothing matters
no use waiting then
so have i
from you i like it
i am in the hudson bay company s store that man last night the one that followed me
i do not think that is on the market anymore i would like something much closer to the water
there s another man right outside the booth here i never saw him before
no percentage in that
they are going to arrest me
i know killaine has a warrant
i have my own warrant stop a minute please
how bad is it bad enough for
yes i have never been very far from it for a long time will you do something for me
how bad is the other thing the secret
it did but it never paid off until now i ought to be back within an hour we cannot leave until near dark anyway
do you have to leave the note
it is the frame on the picture but not if you say so
you would not like it i have been there
my father died in jail and he was twice the man i am
i can still see the shoreline the moon is rising
there would be a moon tonight
wonder what
if you are doing all this just for me
that and the fun of it
i thought you had to be back to the hotel to leave my my note
that is right
including killaine
including killaine i still cannot think of you that way
if it was an accident you could have told the truth
so could you but our records were a little against us
what your father did does not condemn you
he will come back they always come back when you give them money
not this one and not mitchell
you killed him
i am still on course to victoria nobody saw you get on board nobody seen you since
and i am begging for my life and yours
and that nasty man that followed us last night you did not kill him
you think magruder wants to hang beside me
every day of your life you will want me you will never get over it every time you see your face in the mirror
shut up cut it out even if i have to kill both of us
do you think i was faking
if i did i do not now
i would like a dry martini very dry please
sorry miss beer and ale only canadian law
beer well all right
beer or ale miss
ale i do not mind
right miss
i do not know her or particularly want to
i will have to know a little more than that
i am sorry that is all there is
you did not ask a question you made a speech
that is an evasion and you know it
it is
there s the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger
regimental seaforth highlanders
i am sorry
stop saying you are sorry i want information not regrets
would you be satisfied if i said i shot him
a graduation present
why do not you arrest me and be done with it
i probably shall after i have tortured you a little more
deep blue i would call it grey blue
you must come from pretty far south
true i was a bit irritable last night i apologize
you were a galahad compared to some cops i have known
you have had dealings with the police before
who has not one way or another
but not in the investigation of a major crime i hope
is it a crime
we are 98 per cent certain mitchell was murdered there are a lot of reasons was he very drunk when you last saw him
you were there when i last saw him
i would like to believe that it is not too easy
the police always do do not they
you have has an experience that you do not want to talk about an unhappy marriage for example
you or the vancouver police department
we try to be decent
nobody can help me you least of all
if i understand what you meant by that
you understand perfectly
then there is not much i can do is there
there is not anything you can do
i do not want to talk
i have come here to arrest you for murder
i might be able to save you if i knew enough
you would not even try there must be some copper in you or you would not be an inspector
there must be but when i am with you i cannot find it
he looks at the girl looks into her eyes
what does he see
that is my hard luck i am man enough to tell you about it and not be sorry
what do your friends call you the ones that know you well and like you very much
they call me jeff
jeff shall we go now jeff and get it over with
so mitchell had handled it afterwards brandon picked it up there s no indication you handled it
i always wear gloves when i shoot people a bad joke but better than tears
time s up i am off the case
they will only find someone else who will not be so kind
that is something i cannot spare you but i will not do it myself
because you think your in love with me
to do what
i cannot answer that
what will they do to you
that is they are business can i drop you somewhere
you are still a police officer jeff i saw you send those two men away i know they were watching me
what proper grounds you cannot be in love with me you hardly know me i am not in love with you
i know that
but even if you were in love with me
there s an empty taxi across the street if you are so anxious take it he will know the way to the police headquarters
you do things the hard way do not you
goodbye betty
we know everything
no jeff you do not he is not a murderer i tell you he is not a murderer
i hope he can prove it come on you do not want to get pneumonia
i understand betty i understand perfectly
morning any calls
mr reed would like you to call him
all right get him
and there s a mr goble to see you says his business is personal
who s goble
this way
i am not interested in blind dates
you asked for it
i am still asking what do you want
i am not sure i want anything from you you might want something from me
name it
mayfield oh that girl you were with last night you have not hired me yet mr brandon
quit trying to scare me mr brandon i am neurotic
if i call the police your price will go down to a minus sign
bluff you have waited too long
for five hundred what do i get
i go home and paint the kitchen
for two hundred
i stick around and wait for the five hundred
you mentioned information
sorry another client paid for that you can hire me not to use it
a thousand
got it on you
got the information on you
get it in half an hour
why not here
i do not like your perfume in my office make it somewhere else if you do not like charlie s
charlie s suits me fine i do not scare
in the same elevator it is a public conveyance
leave that one lay
they still hang women in canada i have heard
until he comes he is a nice guy you have met him
that comedian
that is a buzzer
so you are not a cop
me a cop what made you think that mr brandon
who told you my name
i have got good ears
the new ones are fine the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble
you are not english
how is life treating you
the usual grind
round of golf saturday
if i can get off
hardly who s the girl
somebody mitchell picked up on the train i do not even know her name
she does not look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train
that is what i thought at first maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party with my liquor of course
yes i have seen it before
quite sure you had no motive
i rather thought so and before that had you ever seen the gun
near his right hand about a foot away perhaps more good heavens one does not use a tape measure
we do when we get the chance
no thanks i had some how would you like to take a walk for say half and hour
i do not
well good night
if it does not take too long drink
thanks i do not mind
i never notice the view after the first week
i would fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap wonderful thing money is remember what somerset maugham said about it
i would not know
money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others very appealing especially to a poor man
could we discuss that some other time
sure let s discuss betty mayfield how long since you saw her
a couple of hours
i have a warrant for her arrest
that must hurt
you would be breaking the law
does not answer the question
the only answer i have for you
you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her what toughened you up
it could have been an accident
that could be told
not if she knew she would not be believed
your concentrating too hard killaine what about margo west she had a motive i guess you know by this time whose gun it was
mitchell was killed down here how could clarendon get in to do it or margo for that matter
how could mitchell after that act he put on up here is it likely she would let him in
she did not have to he could have climbed down from here
you do not buy it okay so i still want betty mayfield where is she
no idea
where would she go anyway do not tell me you have not got her covered
i am afraid they do far too often so long
wait a minute i will go with you
now and then mostly just for the fun of it
i tried it once i lost my shirt
i buy my shirts by the dozen fortunately
where did it all come from or is that a permissible question
oh that was just one of those idle questions one does not expect an answer
the liquors lovely the rest of the party you can have
lay off cannot you
did i do something wrong
i would not know just do it somewhere else there is such a thing as good manners
how would you know brandon
want to walk out or get thrown out
you do not throw guests out brandon
do not bet on it i am eccentric
mr mitchell
a little something on account perhaps
rather more than a little something mr mitchell
i am afraid this is all for the moment
nothing to discuss tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter be grateful for small mercies
i see out friend larry mitchell is with us again
oh shut up you have not even got your spats on
i do not think you locked your door
what do you want
and now that he is safe from all other women you can go on loving him
you nasty sardonic
sardonic if you will my dear bust nasty you lied about the gun
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun you lied it was obvious
he saw my face too
so he did but he has not told you what he saw i have
they will arrest that girl everything points to her
convenient is not it
how clumsy i would never forgive myself good night my dear
you could have got in that room just as you got in here how do i know you did not kill larry
with what motive
nastiness you are nasty with words why would not you be nasty with deeds once in a while you hated him and i know why
he was very easy to hate if you will look in your mirror when you are in a better temper you will know why
i am sorry inspector i do not know much about
recently then
no not recently i am sure of that
thank you
thank you it is rather late and i am not young anymore good night
you are the waterfront specialist find out about it i have got a murder to investigate
you have two murders to investigate this man s head was beaten in and there s nothing in his pockets
drunk rolling job they hit him too hard
i am an irishman sir an irishman is always logical
i have got a year or a second i am not sure which
you told me when we would identified this fellow
if you would seen the blood on his head and some body had to carry him out to sea
i understand pity to mess up a nice clean boat
i got through to greer his partner in the detective business greer will not give out
would you
if you are asking my opinion no i would read it to greer over the phone ask him if he had any objections
how important would it have to be it is only murder inspector
men like you do not need orders
the joint s not open mac who s brandon
go live in a tent
it will be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet
talk english how do i know you are you
one of those nice long manila envelopes sealed not too fat not too thin
what do i get for it
you get it is brother
sounds like a fair swap let s take a look
open it and count it
when you sign for it you count it it is your dough
so it seems sergeant
they tell me he will be a great loss to the liquor trade this mayfield girl
i have met her
correct inspector a woman s gun u s 125 caliber ammunition in it it was on a table in there
so the shell ought to have gone over
unless the gun was slanted up
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer
right a clean deduction from observed facts they have got to be simple once in a while inspector
i have always looked forward to it all right let s get him out of here and tidy up
i guess i am just ballast around here
gigi huh sounds french one of those fancy ladies must have been very fancy if he scratched her phone number in gold
market it seems to me that is a san francisco exchange
somebody did it twice last night in the dark
maybe we have been pretty dumb
there was not any motive let s try out the act
i think so
where is the shell
should be over there
assume there is something to hid i go to a lot of trouble what do i do what would you do
do i know who lives down there
you can find out
do i know that she is out of the room likely to be out of it for some time
you can find out the first part the second part you have to take a chance on
pretty big chance huh
you have got a dead man on your hands like this
well what about it
if she did not if luck was against him he wipes the gun off reaches the wall up there drops it on the chaise
no suicide
did we ever really think it was suicide
i never wear a hat oh so i am i forgot i guess i am terribly sorry again mrs west
oh nothing
are you always this witty
warm water no doubt
not quiet yet
i was in love with him which shows you the quality of my brains why do not you ask her about the gun
i shall from your knowledge of mitchell would you say he would be likely to commit suicide
anybody could commit suicide if he felt low enough i have felt it myself
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt
how did you know clarendon you cops never tell anybody anything do you
other people always know so much more than we know so much more than they are willing to tell us
it was clarendon he knew i had the gun in my bag
of course not thanks for telling me i have not seen mr clarendon
i am a fool
that depends upon your motive you were in love with mitchell were not you
did you ever have a serious operation
mortar shells are not funny either
it does may i go now
i will investigate mr clarendon s financial position
i do not understand
perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems
now you are being beastly
four different people inspector three men and a women i have made slides for two they handled both envelopes
how about magruder
he checks too
that leaves two strangers
so far
try betty mayfield the mitchell case
mayfield she fit into this
she might
i will take your word
the card says so does not it
brandon handled the money envelope
how do you do sir
she is a suspect naturally but not the only one
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment
aye you have a point there
a little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either
it will not look pretty good on your record killaine where is the girl now
i do not know sir
well find out who s covering her
nobody s covering her i detached the officer assigned to that duty
i disagree sir as inspector in charge of the case i have the right to form that opinion the right to act on it
ye have have ye
we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfield s toilet articles washington ought to teletype us within a few hours
and in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases does what she pleases
yes sir
but you still think she is innocent
i do
nor i this is why i gave it to you
what are my orders sir
you think i am wrong about this bit of a girl go out and prove it against me
with your charm how could i help it have a nice trip
so so
who s the girl
her name s mayfield betty mayfield
why should i mind
you should not you washed me up very thoroughly
as thoroughly as i could it was not easy but you are helping me
margo darling you washed me up remember we are just friends you wanted it that way
she is very beautiful she is much younger than i am and she is rich i hope
rich i have not the faintest idea why
you ought to know why
i do not my hunch is she is just torn up an unhappy marriage i was able to do her a small favor
splendid now she can return the compliment
you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police
i have a rough idea
you would go to jail for a long term
correct i could not even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me
you do not have to make a pose of it
it is the only pose i have left i am sunk broke i do not even have my hotel bill
i seem to recognize this routine first the kiss then the touch oh that is the use you are you
that is not very kind
kind or not kind that is the difference it always ends up the same way
what does it look like
how long have you had it
years why
it is against the law to cross the border with a gun the canadian police might like to know about this
you already have the checks darling
i did not mean it that way i am sorry
oh forget it clark brandon s throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening take me
of course
how about your new friend
i told you she is just
a girl you meet on the train excuse my bringing it up again be back in an hour right
it is quite unimportant mr mitchell after all you got what you wanted
be nasty
i have no intension of being nasty mr mitchell
in that case there s someone here i would like to introduce to you over there

why not i am not needed here
but you are needed especially now with most of the other men away you are captain of the stand by squad
sure the standby squad stand by for the funeral
whose funeral we are doing all right there has not been a scab near the picket line for three days
who said anything about giving up i will never go back to the company on my knees never
i do not know but i can feel it coming it is like like a lull before the storm charley vidal says
charley vidal says do not throw charley vidal up to me
charley s my friend i need friends why are you afraid to have me as your friend
i do not know what you are talking about
and if you cannot understand this you are a fool because you cannot win this strike without me you cannot win anything without me
what are you saying
this means they have given up trying to break the picket line now we can all fight together all of us
but honey
or why do not you just put a sign outside no dogs or women allowed
look who s talking the great white father and world s champion of women s rights
aw cut it out ruth
then why s the company hanging tough they have signed contracts with other locals why not this one
because most of us here are mexican americans because we want equality with anglo miners the same pay the same conditions
yeah lots of provocation lately they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge maybe they can bust the strike
maybe not but there s another thing like when you came in tonight i heard you ask your wife who s that his grandfather
you mean delaware
no new york
new york you are not the company president by any chance
well if that is possible
it is possible just negotiate
are we talking to a union spokesman
i thought maybe you forgot
forgot what
it is mama s saint s day
papa we seen em two scabs over there
she is coming charley vidal gave her a lift
i do not want you hanging around there hear
the what
the junior shop stewards there s lots of ways we can help
do not i have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school
but papa you need all the help you can get
you have got to help around the house
but you have got me doing everything mama never used to make me dry the
you should have helped her without being asked

mrs torrance most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained they are brought on by emotional factors and they rarely occur again
only about three months eh we are from vermont my husband was teaching school there

grady oh
will you indeed mr torrance
your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined mr torrance somewhat more resourceful she seems to have got the better of you
for the moment mr grady only for the moment

that is very good jack because eh for some people eh solitude and isolation
can of itself be a problem
not for me
how about your wife and son how do you think they will take to it
they will love it
i am intrigued
i do not suppose they eh told you anything in denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970
well my predecessor in this job
well that is eh quite a story
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened
no problem in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat
no my son s discovered the games room
oh has your luggage been brought in
well it is very homely
oh it is beautiful my god this place is fantastic is not it hon
oh well they are really gorgeous as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i have ever seen
oh well he sure did a beautiful job pink and gold are my favorite colors
oh i will say
boy i bet you we could really have a good party in this room huh hon
just like a ghost ship huh
how do you do
eight thirty
well that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first
you will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace loving people
all right mister ambassador but you must treat general buck schmuck with the respect due him
certainly how about some breakfast
possibly some coffee
do not be ridiculous
i have your word mister president
yes of course
at his office in the capitol
if he is not there try 87 43 56
did you get that kulnick
i am sorry sub miniature photography is my hobby it is amazing what excellent en largements you can make from the negative
i will hold this if you do not mind you can have it back when you leave
it is buried somewhere in the grudd mountains
that is preposterous we have no such program
the source was shall we say completely reliable
the report is entirely untrue i can assure you of that
how dare you talk to me in this manner
that is nonsense and you know it
i know nothing of the sort
surely you do not expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same
and surely you do not expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons
goodbye mister ambassador
we have many splendidly deep mines in our country
oh yes that is right
mister president are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this
i caught you red handed mister ambassador
give that back to me
what do you think of this mister president i told you we should not let him in here
you are absolutely right we would not no sane nation ever would that is why it was designed to trigger itself automatically
then all you have to do is untrigger it
you mean you will tell us his name
it is not a he general it was an article in the times about a year and a half ago
that is right fella
one two three four five why you dirty stinking
come in come in peace on earth peace on earth yes
why are you saying that phrase over and over again
i think that just might be it although it could be riki tiki tavi
what are you talking about major
it might still be worth trying riki tiki tavi r t t there s only three combinations of t t r or t r t
who the hell do you think you are sir
look i did not shoot him
we will have to leave that up to the c i would boys will not we major
look colonel i have got to talk to somebody at air command
do not worry major your rights will be fully protected
colonel do not you know that is going on
sure i do there was some kind of mutiny on the base and you killed general ripper
look general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd bomb wing to attack with h bombs
you must think i am an awful sap major just sit down fella and keep your hands on the desk
did not they tell you
they told me major and i did not hear anything about any atomic attack
look colonel maybe it is too late maybe they have sent air command in already but we have got to try to con tact somebody
on your feet fella i have got to get outside and see how my men are
wait a minute the president that is it the president
what about the president
he wanted to talk to general ripper did not he
so what
well i am general ripper s executive officer he will want to talk to me
colonel remember a reprimand from the president can be pretty serious to a career officer just a second operator i know i have it somewhere
what is your name young lady
ceida pietraszkiewicz
what did you say
ceida pietraszkiewicz p i e t r a s z k i e w i c z
now look here miss pietraszkiewicz this is air command headquarters calling
yes who the hell is this
what did you say sir
no sir
then why bother me with this nonsense get in touch with the base commander
i know it sounds crazy sir but we tried and nobody answers any of the telephones
well that is the funny part of it too sir it does not show a damned thing
what kind of trouble
yes sir he issued attack orders to
to be perfectly honest mister president we really are not sure
you are not sure
be fair mister president did not we initiate the human reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons
i am afraid i will have to ask you to take the film out
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies
well sir they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base
that is a very wise deduction general
thank you sir but what shall i tell them to do if they are denied entrance
well i suppose penetrate the base by force
you see you knew the answer all the time general
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt mister president
what do you suppose is going to happen if general ripper s planes start bombing their targets
that certainly would be a problem sir
i want him upped to brigadier general and recomended for the would s c
yes sir
this is general ripper speaking
yes sir
do you recognize my voice
certainly general why do you ask sir
i do not know sir we just spoke a few minutes ago
youddo not think i would ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important do you major
no sir
yes sir
all right major i am putting the base on condition red
condition red
that is right i want this flashed to all section immediately
yes sir that is up general ripper
a shooting war
yes major this looks like it is going to be it
but what kind of a shooting war have they hit any of our cities yet
that is right sir
we do not want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the president down do we
you are right sir
no calls from inside out no calls from outside in are even answered no calls
i understand sir nothing comes or goes without your personal say so
no calls at all with or without my say so my voice can be imitated too major
yes sir i just thought of something sir how do i know i am talking to you now
who do you think you are talking to
to you sir but how do i know
are you trying to be insubordinate
no sir
i hope not now as soon as you do what i told you have plan r radioed to the wing
plan r
are you hard of hearing major
no sir plan r to be radioed to the wing
as soon as you have done that shut down the communications center lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details
no sir i am just bringing the facts to your attention sir
you are a good officer major and you are perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention
thank you sir
that is right major
oh it is not my radio sir i picked it up in the communications center
i did not mean for anyone to play anyone else s radio either major
yes sir general can i ask a question
certainly major mandrake you are a good officer and you can ask me a question any time you want to
well general ripper sir i was thinking we are on a condition red are not we
that is correct major
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress does not it
you know the regulations well major
well i was thinking maybe an enemy attack is not in progress
and if that were true
because i thought it proper major why else would you think i would do it
but why that would be an awful thing to do sir
perhaps major perhaps pour me a scotch and soda please and help yourself to whatever you like
we have come a long way since world war ii major and the lessons we have learned are all in plan r
you are damned right they are
how much soda sir
just a squirt
perfect thank you major and now let s drink a toast
to peace on earth
ask away major
well general i was wondering why are you doing this i mean why do you want to start the war
i have given it alot of thought major do not think i have not
no sir i mean i did not think you had not given it a lot of thought
do you remember what clemenceau once said about war
i do not think so sir
he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals
i see
that is close enough major
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people sir
you are being dense major i certainly don t
our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy would not they
i guess so
i know so major i know so and add to that the whole air command force being committed to clobber everything they have got
major mandrake i guess you do not follow that is going on too closely do you
where sir
where everywhere major everywhere
not yet major not yet
and i guess they will not until they agree to let us inspect inside their country
you are very naive major do not they say they want disarmament
yes sir but so do we
but we mean it because we are a peace loving country are they a peace loving country major
well for the same reasons we do sir do not you see
major you are talking like one of them
well i am not sir honestly sir
do not be offended major our president holds the same views
do not you think he knows something about this general ripper
but if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want we would agree would not we
if they gave us what we think we need yes i guess we would
and you would like to see that
general that is good enough for the president and all the experts he is got working on the thing is good enough for me
do you think we would cheat
no sir i am sure we would not
do you think they would cheat
yes sir why do not you stop the fighting sir
peace on earth
i presume the planes are armed
i am afraid so mister presient being part of the air borne alert each plane is carrying a full load about fifty megatons apiece
well what about the positive control the safety catch do not the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order
that is right sir but the planes were at their positive control points ready to turn around when general ripper issued the final go code
and i suppose there s some reason why you have not recalled them
yes sir the base commander general ripper selected plan r
what the hell is plan r
we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty five min utes
how could you let this happen general schmuck
i want to talk to general ripper
but we cannot communicate with the base
admiral buldike
that is the idea general schmuck zlat
knock it off will you general crudley find out that is holding up that call
they are coming in now
how long will it take to receive them all
i am not certain mister president the boys in concom do the pencil work
how many planes did we lose
i am not certain mister president but i believe it was four
general faceman what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson
naturally i am sir
he says they have only shot down three planes
well if you choose to take his word over mine
look he is there and you are here
mister president there were thirty four aircraft involved thirty acknowledged the recall that makes four shot down
hello are you still there uh huh i will be right back we are still working this thing out
well just common sense sir thirty from thirty four equals four or my name s not buck schmuck
have you tried the recall again
well the premier doped it out pretty well its primary is their missile base at laputa
zlat make sure the secret service boys care fully search his seven body orifices
no they would not send us in with bombs on an exercise
roughly one zero five i will have it plotted in a minute major kong
roger one three eight
lothar take your checks now
thanks binky can you see bromdingna island yet
i do not think so
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level
you know what that will do to our fuel consumption
cannot help it that is the wind like
maybe it is an exercise
they must have clobbered some of our cities already
he is right they must have clobbered some of our cities already
the dirty stinking rotten sons of b s they might have clobbered marge and the
fifteen twelve o clock
forget it quentin it can happen to the best of us now let s get squared away
main interference linked to electronic detector fight interference on readi ness state
roger keep calling them knock off auto pilot ace
they must have been fired from bromdingna probably one of their new vampire 202 s they have got a range well over a hundred miles
forty five still coming straight and fast twelve o clock
call them every five miles
thirty five still straight
maximum ecm
we will worry about that later okay i will take damage reports
lieutenant toejam why do not you help him
come on quentin is not that pretty selfish putting yourself ahead of the mission
look i am shot it hurts
lieutenant quiffer we are all sorry you were hit and we will help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away
look cannot someone help me
they must have made a visual contact
must be mach two five stuff altitude fifteen thousand
they cannot touch us at this height
they are moving apart
i think they mean business
hang on boys
hey terry i am hit
could you take her up right now king other wise we will get kind of close to the fireball
sure i will take her up right now
check your code again no one at base would pull a stunt like that terry
that is what i am doing and it comes out the same
yeah it sure looks like the real thing all right
ready major
primary arming switch
lieutenant toejam s going to help you in a minute can you check your ecm
listen i think i am hit bad
where would they get you
damn you lieutenant toejam lothar
some kind of signaling
no kidding
very interesting
forget it
skip it and jump damn you this flak s so close i can smell it
shoot lothar
our targets are a missile complex and an airfield not cities right
that is what i said
well if there s a war they must have hit us first
that is your point lothar
hellnno major i was just trying to think the thing through
bomb doors circuit is green bomb release circuit is green bomb fusing circuit is green
check all bomb circuits green okay lothar
when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary major
as soon as i have checked over the route about five minutes all right
primary trigger switch
first safety
seond safety
check ten thousand air burst
master kong
all right lothat that does it master safety on now until bomb run
master safety on
everything still checks out okay
lothar get up here fast and bring your first aid kit i am hit kinda bad i think
cannot ace help you
he is dead
what happened
i bit his jugular vein now will you shut up and get up here
sure sure i am on my way
in the back feels like an arrowhead
hell he looks dead
listen give me a shot quick
quentin how is your gear
recall what mistake
no i think it means recall period mistake and the ope is probably the crm 114 code terry
what do you mean
i mean pulling a stunt like that
what are you talking about
well we sure as hell are not going home just because the enemy tells us to
wait a minute major ope that is the recall code where would they get that
you tell me
they must have gotten it from the base no one else would know it
why should they call us back
how the hell do i know maybe the war s over
look this is different
then that settles it does not it
like hell it does
the crm 114 is smashed right
right so how could we get any messages
that is the point
i do not get you king
i said that is the point
look king maybe you have lost too much blood or something
lieutentant zogg how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back
take it easy major kong
then get off my back
but the code is made up by general ripper and he is the only one left at the base who would know the code
nobody s loyalty is beyond question besides how do we know one of his staff did not see it
come on king that does not make sense
okay how do we know they did not shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew how do we know that
you are giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball
first lesson in war college never under estimate your enemy
sorry king
forget it okay team let s break it up and get ready for the kick off
it is me lothar are you okay
i am okay that is up
well i hate to say this but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck
are you sure
well i cannot get out and look king but i do not get a green light
maybe the warning system s out
but i get a red light
have you tried the emergency system
i tried everything something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took
but i told you i do not think we can get the bomb bay doors open
i asked you a question lothar
let me check
there s no other way boys i am going to have to take her in the hard way
would it matter if they hit at a flat angle i mean do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger
well it would probably help if you took it sort of straight down
what the hell are you doing here lothar
now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for lothar
i thought maybe you would like some company
i would be mighty proud if you did lothar
thanks king i have always wanted to take one of these big babies in
listen lothar you know that crack i made about your butt
forget it
i just wanted you to know i did not mean anything by it
sure king
yes the radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep
but they could not come out for a hundred years

this whole thing was a shakedown
i do not want to know
i do not know who was that guy that used to talk about soze in new york

i do not know this is bad

something i do not know i ever tell you about the restaurant i wanted to open
who s keyser soze
russian i think i do not know
just do what i tell you
i would have to say my spine was broken keyser
this i had to see myself
you know damn well dead man
hey that was your mistake not mine did you ever think to ask me i have been
my employer wishes to remain anonymous
mr soze will be most
listen to me cocksucker there is no keyser sate if you say his name again i 11 kill you right here
a strange threat i can only assume you are here to kill me anyway pity about mr redfoot
neither do we
we will see
edie finneran she is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition i requested she be put on the case personally she flew out yesterday
you are lying
am i 92 92 int hallway fiftieth floor
i have got a ton of work and no good people
a friend of mine in new york tells me you knew spook hollis
business or personal
ai not it a crime call if you are interested
you did not know
who is he
some limey he is a middle man for somebody he does not say and i do not ask
we want to meet him
he wants to meet you he called last night and asked me to set it up what do i tell him
tell him we will meet
what the fuck is that
two hours tops
i want to see him
someplace else then
which is shit
no matter he will have to know how close we came
keyser sate or not if keaton s alive he will never come up again
i 11 find him
waste of time
a rumor is not a rumor that does not die
if it was a dope deal where is the dope if it was a hit who called it in
and i am sure you have a host of wild theories to answer these questions
you know damn well what i think
i told the would a everything i know
i know he was good
he was a corrupt cop verbal
keaton was a piece of shit
i just want to hear your story
that is been suppressed anything in there is inadmissible
oh i know sweet deal you have total immunity
well i do have the weapons charge i am looking at six whole months hard time
you know a dealer named ruby deemer verbal
you know a religious guy named john paul
you know ruby is in attica
he did not have my lawyer
i know ruby he is very big on respect likes me very much
i 11 be sure to mention that to him
you wanted to know what happened after the line up i am telling you
sure and i am supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service was not his idea
come on keaton was a cop for four years who else would know the taxi service
what lawyer
is he the one that killed keaton
no but i am sure keaton s dead
you tell me agent kujan if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor what would you say
turn state s evidence take the stand on this and we will hear it out
if there is a keyser soze he will be looking for you
this is totally irrelevant
give a guy a break huh
what happened
kobayashi told us where we could find fenster
why did not you say anything
wait a minute
i do not have a minute are you saying it was keyser soze you told the would a you did not know who it was
i do not
i do not know what you are talking about
you know you have known this whole fucking time give it to me
then why did not you help him
it was keyser soze agent kujan i mean the devil himself how do you shoot the devil in the back
i don t
no verbal you were not friends keaton did not have friends he saved you because he wanted it that way it was his will
the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to customs has been
why lie about everything else then
you think he is
you posted twenty minutes ago captain leo wants you out of here a s a p unless you turn state s
i 11 take my chances thank you it is tougher to buy the cheapest bag man than it is to buy a cop
no provisions nothing my clients testimony for his immunity
mr kint will plead guilty to weapons possession
you are joking
weapons misdemeanor one
counselor you are insulting me
counselor you are bluffing shall i push for misdemeanor two
yes viktor davidov miss
doctor jones christmas jones no jokes i’ve heard them all
don’t know any doctor jokes
couldn’t make it splitting headache
so who are you
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens
alright then brunch
then it’s no longer a bomb
it’s a bomb alright we’re still dead if the trigger charge goes off
i did kill us she thinks we’re dead and she thinks she got away with it
what the hell are you talking about
it’s part of some plan she dresses it up like a terrorist attack the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium
who’s she
elektra king
elektra king are you insane this is her pipeline
makes her look even more innocent
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium
i was hoping you could tell me
she just upped the stakes all her chips are on the table now and m’s life is part of the bet
elektra would control it all
we go down to the torpedo bay
he’s going to insert the plutonium
like riding a bike
just wanted to put him on edge
but what if
count to twenty i’ll be there
we can’t
so isn’t it time you unwrapped your present
i need you to pass me fit now molly
james it wouldn’t really be
perhaps after this test
quite the opposite in fact
she’s not a girl anymore
it’s barely a scratch the dome broke my fall
well at least it turned out to have some purpose
i took the initiative
you haven’t been given an assignment in this case
i was the one who brought that money in
i’m well aware of your stake in this 007 if you have a point get to it
the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra
now robert is dead he got his revenge
then robert was right about a russian connection
is maybe the inside woman
which is neutral no doubt
who did you get it from
i am just a middle man i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss
your last chance take the money
your last chance give me the name
stripped of all your weaponry you still threaten me
i can’t tell you alright alright but you must protect me
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva
consider me ungrateful
it’s i who should thank you for taking that money back to mi 6 so distressing for m an explosion inside her lair
she’ll get over it
you even brought the plane for us we really couldn’t have done it without you
haven’t you heard the news so is she
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs
a word i’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover
you knew him well
i’m sorry
he died before he could complete his lifelong dream i intend to finish it for him
funerals aren’t exactly memorable
partially yes
my bodyguard he follows me everywhere he’s decisive vigilant and he makes an excellent omelette
how long has he been with you
since the kidnapping why do you ask
it’s my father’s pin he wore it everyday of his life
you are wrong mr bond in fact i am the only person who can do it
always wanted to see the upper lines
you don’t take no for an answer do you
we’re alright
you’re not going to
it’s the only way out
i know
i think you’re one of the bravest people i’ve ever met
you should rest
then take me with you
no you’ll be safe here
i don’t want to be safe
i have to go to work
two shaken not stirred
you had your chance james now i’m looking for a bigger thrill
not at that price time to surrender
a little does it matter after all what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive isn’t that right elektra isn’t that your motto
what are you talking about
or did you steal it from your old friend renard
you can drop the act it’s over
i don’t know what you’re talking about
i think you do
you do what you have to do but i’ve called in m she’s en route from london even now
not interested
soon she’ll be everywhere
five more turns and your neck will break
just like you only you were even easier
he killed me he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom
it is my oil mine and my family’s
elektra it’s not too late eight million people needn’t die
oh james
bondjamesbond what brings you here
you of course i need some information
have some of the rat’s nest caviar from my own fishery they buy my caviar drink my champagne lose to my house
how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with state of the art russian army weapons
what this is not possible
where did you get this
off a high powered paraski that was trying to kill me
how high up does this arms dealing go
bond if someone wants you dead it is renard our government has nothing to gain by killing you
but you would have something to gain by killing robert king and stopping his pipeline
she’s no innocent this is my nuclear consultant
ah i see a purely plutonic relationship
what’s your business with elektra king
i thought you were the one in her business
you are out of your league she’s working with renard
a rope
no the truth she thought i was dead those blades were meant for you what do you know that she would kill you for
and the payoff on the tables
a special job a a a submarine
no get me out
this is too big for even you where is it
this is a family matter if my nephew is in danger we do it my way or nothing now get me out
the right kind of explosion in the right spot it would block the bosphorus cut off the black sea
how appropriate
i’d heard there were some renovations there no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years
former kgb surveillance post the dye factory was just a front now it turns a good profit
c class
could could you come
is nothing his kingdom he stole from my mother the kingdom i will rightly take back
someone will come
who bond bond is dead
how would you know
of course
what do you think
no it is the beginning the world will never be the same
yes au revoir
and expensive cost three million plus
anywhere in this circle iran iraq pakistan syria afghanistan
it’s heading for the oil terminal
where it can do the most damage
still no contact yet
we all do
i am afraid without cerebro s help he will not have the strength to heal himself and without the neuro filter there s no cerebro
i do not like him being here
what are you talking about
his vital signs are weak and getting weaker
we have to find magneto
no i am i do not know if we can do this without charles
well i think that is perfectly understandable
i will tell you one thing though
that is that
he calls me sport one more time and i will blow a watermelon sized hole through him
into the hudson
uh huh
it is too far
storm rogue you take the south entrance jean and i will go in here
i am sorry i am not strong enough
i wanted to talk to you
i do not remember is that what you wanted to ask me
you know you
shut up i got no interest in you xavier or your x men
sure you are sport
some cigars case of beer
there s no smoking or drinking on the school grounds
i will not light the cigars how about that
yeah well i do not like to talk about my past
maybe the professor could help you with that
by reading my thoughts
if necessary
what if they are naughty
he is busy right now
were you now
what do you say
not interested
suit yourself
he takes his work seriously
he takes himself seriously
what is it you are failing to get at are you interested in me
i have seen a lot of rings
yeah i will bet you have
i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded senator the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous
you would not happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to
control senator we teach them control
treat you like a mutant we are not what you think not all of us
tell it to the ones that did this to me
i can assure you there is no such creature in my genes
mr guyrich has been dead for some time senator
you mutant bastards
gosh i hope so
let s just say god works too slowly
what do you want
come with me and i will let her live
you think i care about her i am the only one who s sure to walk out of here
you are backstage at the encore of creation
i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto
this this whole god damn thing making yourselves into some sort of team of super powered freaks teaching wayward mutants about classical literature for what
to find rogue
actually magneto helped me put it together
he helped you
we were friends once but that was a long time ago
i will go
they are all asking how you are doing are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone
actually i am feeling up to leaving
what miss me charley i am gonna walk out the front door and trust me it will not be soon enough for everyone here
the sun is setting logan you have been asleep for nineteen hours
what did she do to me
if she held on any longer she could have
and you think it helps calling her rogue
a piece only a piece
is it enough
enough for a test
and i will never understand terrorists
i am trying to save our kind charles you should do the same
not at the cost of lives max
what do you want with him
still trying to make the world safe for our kind still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves definitively
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me max what is it like these days
i am going to change the world with or without you as a witness charles and this one gets a front row seat
what do you mean to do
what do you mean to do
i know
and what do you do when you wake up to that
i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble
