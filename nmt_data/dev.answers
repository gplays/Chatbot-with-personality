these are originals
it is miraculous
tomorrow night i dine with the emperor one word from me and the post is his
what for
some service deserves service in return no
what do you mean

not at all
where is our friend
he is not in but he is working on it he said to tell you

he is doing his best
oh yes and that is so intelligent about writing a requiem
money money
you are mad she is mad wolfi
i see that you are expecting
oh yes
when may i ask
what is ridiculous wolfi has many admirers in vienna they love him here people send us gifts all the time
but you cannot take her without reference it is unheard of
and so you do the only time you come out is to eat
and what do you expect who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day
oh now i am a bad housekeeper
so you are the place is a pigsty all the time
be careful
let us pass please let us pass at once we are with the emperor
i am sorry madame it is not permitted
do you know who i am  this is my daughter i am frau weber we are favoured guests
i am sorry madame but i have my orders
i am sorry madame but no i cannot let anyone pass
it is such an honour for us to have you here herr mozart and for gertrude
what a strange young man
perhaps a little refreshment first a little coffee or a little chocolate
just one year
who was your teacher
i was but she quite outgrew the little i could show her
what a charming idea may i see
it is just a trifle of course
delightful court composer would you permit me to play it as he comes in
you do me too much honour sire
and here is our illustrious court composer herr salieri
well i am glad to hear that
excuse me sire but what do you think these could be being a foreigner i would love to learn
good morning court composer this is my niece the princess elizabeth
oh your majesty it would be such a tremendous honour
you already commissioned an opera from mozart
and the result satisfies
yes of course my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
i do not think you understand me court composer
majesty i did believe me it was a most agonizing decision but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart
majesty i do not like to talk against a fellow musician
of course not
do you like this salieri
it is not a question of liking your majesty your own law decrees it i am afraid
oh thank you
the director of our opera count orsinirosenberg
and now he has returned the compliment herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you
why so
well what is it about tell us the story
yes where
keep it sire if you want to it is already here in my head
what on one hearing only
it is new it is is not it sire
yes indeed
and german
oh yes absolutely german unquestionably
what do you mean sire
majesty this is madame weber she is my landlady
really how delightful may i ask when you marry
bravo mozart most charming yes indeed clever man
majesty may i ask you to do me the greatest favour
mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre
yes sire
yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true
who told you this majesty
it is not your place to ask questions is it true
well yes i admit it is
would you tell me why
but majesty this is just a frolic it is a piece about love
i have no idea
guess guess majesty imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
well six or seven minutes maybe eight
forgive me majesty i am a vulgar man but i assure you my music is not
you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade
ahha what do you say chamberlain
yes sir
well what do you have for me today
your majesty herr mozart 
yes what about him
he is here
why are you here
am i not welcome
is she not here
do not you have a maid
oh we could if we wanted to but stanzi will not hear of it she wants to do everything herself
how is your financial situation
it could not be better
that is not what i hear
what do you mean it is wonderful really it is  it is marvelous people love me here
they say you are in debt
who who says that now that is a malicious lie
composition does not pay you know that
that is that
oh let's not talk about it
why not
it is a secret
you do not have secrets from me
is not that marvelous we are delighted
why did not you mention it in your letters
no really
yes papa name it name it i will do anything you say
i am tired of this game please play without me

opera opera
please do not ask me to go back again i am frightened i am very very frightened

what did he say what did he say
sublime utterly sublime
wonderful  he liked the monkey did not you
yes well it is all good fun

put it down i said it is nothing for you
why not
look i asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes

and which one of them do you want me to teach
i am afraid i am
good morning fraulein schlumberg
never mind strudel it is part of music getting used to an audience are not i right herr mozart
herr mozart what a surprise what can i do for you
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music
well your pupil is married and living in mannheim young man
really perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction
what is this mozart that is the matter with you
well since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead
what for
if a man cannot earn he must borrow
i am sorry no
please i will give it back i promise please sir
love sire
yes yes er on  the whole yes majesty
dear mozart my sincere congratulations
did you like it then
how could i not
i am flattered and congratulations to you of course
why here is the music it is here i am submitting it humbly is not that what you wanted
my dear mozart there is no one in the world i would rather help but now it is too late
whom did they choose
herr sommer
sommer herr sommer but the mangs a fool he is a total mediocrity
look i must have pupils without pupils i cannot manage
you do not mean to tell me you are living in poverty
no but i am broke i am always broke i do not know why
it has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
how can anyone say that we have no cook no maid we have no footman nothing at all
of course not
do you have a daughter
ah how exciting tell me more
i would better not it is a bit of a secret
come come mozart i am interested truly
actually it is a big secret oh this is delicious what is it
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum crema al mascarpone
ah italian
forgive me we all have patriotic feelings of some kind
two thousand two hundred florins is all i need a hundred fifty
what exactly are you working on
wolfgang what is it sta calmo per favore that is the matter
it is unbelievable the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music pages of it
you burned the score
oh no my wife took it out in time
how fortunate
it is not fair that a man like that has power over our work
but there are those who have power over him i think i will take this up with the emperor
oh excellency would you
with all my heart mozart
what did you think of it yourself did you like it at all
i think it is marvelous truly
oh no the honour would be all mine
grazie mio caro wolfgang
mozart it was good of you to come
how could i not
did my work please you
i never knew that music like that was possible
you flatter me
i have come to commission work from you
what work
a mass for the dead
what dead who is dead
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one
who are you
i am only a messenger do you accept you will be paid well
how long will you give me
i do not have it yet it is not finished i am sorry but i need more time
are you neglecting my request
what happened is it over
i am taking you home you are not well
where is your wife
not here she is not well either she went to the spa
you mean she is not coming back
you are so good to me truly thank you
no please
i would never miss anything that you had written you must know that
do you mean that
i do
i have bad fancies i do not sleep well anymore then i drink too much and think stupid things
are you ill
shall i answer it
the man he is here
finish what
another but that is too soon tomorrow night it is impossible did he say a hundred
yes can i  could i help you in any way
would you actually you could
my dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure
but you would have to swear not to tell a soul i am not allowed
then let us try together i would regard it as such an honour tell me what is this work
where did i stop
the end of the recordare  statuens in parte dextra
so now the confutatis confutatis maledictis when the wicked are confounded flammis acribus addictis how would you translate that
consigned to flames of woe
a fire which never dies burning one forever
confutatis maledictis
the fire
what time
i think so
it could not be simpler
first bassoon and tenor trombone  what
with the tenors
also identical
and that is all
do you have me
i think so
c major sopranos and altos in thirds altos on c sopranos above  voca voca me voca me cum bene dictis
sopranos up to f on the second 'voca'
and that is it do you have it
you go fast
do you want to rest a bit
oh no i am not tired at all
we will stop for just a moment then we will do the lacrimosa
i can keep going i assure you shall we try
would you stay with me while i sleep a little
i am not leaving you
i am so ashamed
what for
then why especially does it have to be in german
what you think mozart is scarcely the point it is what his majesty thinks that counts
that will do herr mozart
mozart herr mozart may i have a word with you please right away
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaro's wedding
exactly a dance
but surely the emperor did not mean to prohibit dancing when it is part of the story
what are you doing herr director
can we see the scene with the music back please
what is this herr chamberlain
what is what
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl
because his majesty wishes it
is the emperor angry with me
on the contrary
then why does not he simply appoint me to the post
mozart you are not the only composer in vienna
no but i am the best
a little modesty would suit you better
who is on this committee
kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri
herr mozart 
i do not think it was really decided director
what do you want
i am father vogler i am a chaplain here i thought you might like to talk to someone
about what
in the sight of god that is a sin
what do you want
do you understand that you have sinned gravely
leave me alone
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain
do you know who i am you never heard of me did you
that makes no difference all men are equal in god's eyes
are they
offer me your confession i can offer you god's forgiveness
how well are you trained in music
here in vienna
oh i know that that is charming  i did not know you wrote that
i did not that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is
of course the man you accuse yourself of killing
ah  you have heard that
all vienna has heard that
and do they believe it
is it true
do you believe it
do you hear me
did you try
you cannot say that
my son no one can speak for god
oh i thought you did so every day so speak now answer me
why why why why add to your misery by confessing to murder you did not kill him
i did
no you did not
i poisoned his life
but not his body
what difference does that make
are you absolutely sure
what anger
about the ballet
ballet what ballet
excuse me  did not his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
yes absolutely is there a ballet in figaro
bravo your majesty
well actually sire if you remember we did finally incline to italian
i know we banned this play but frankly i cannot remember why can you refresh my memory herr director
for the same reason herr chamberlain that it was banned in france
here i am my angel
what who the devil are you
i have taken pity on you my angel i heard your wish
i cannot wait
well promise then
what do you mean  now
excuse me sir there is a lady who insists on talking to you
who is she
she did not say but she says it is urgent
that lady is back sir

the recovery is very impressive

i just hope those plates are not radioactive by tomorrow morning
cheese is particularly troublesome
worse than your kraft holiday dip
oh much worse but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip you remember that
how long will we have to stay down here
rather safe than sorry that is my motto
but what if i go into labor that could happen any time
yes dear
home sweet home
that is that noise
the locks
the locks
to keep us from trying to leave after an atomic blast there's a radiation halflife that lasts thirty five years
thirty five years
then after that it is safe
to go up
we have to be strong sweetheart if not for ourselves for the child
burnt to a crisp  i have given you the most welldone cut
i am not hungry
hot dr pepper your favorite

no kidding  who else would have done it
what did you wish for adam

one who does not glow in the dark
calvin webber what a thing to say
let's eat our cake
you know when we do go upi am going to miss this old place how about you hon
in the generator room again
oh yes  it just fascinates me how all    these things work

and i do not fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards
uh yes you do
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean
yes you do
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady
where did he get all that information
from the oddest place his parent's told him i do not think i got that memo
so now i suppose he is trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible
he did not leave with them
welli admit it i am glad to hear that
it is true  she swept him out the door whispering little french things into his ear
what are you going to do go over to her place and kick in the door
good godyou do not think there really is a bomb shelter do you
what do you want to do with it
give it back to him
and if we cannot find him
that is wrong
i do not know  everything's so neat it is all just sogoddamn dear  damn
have him committed
to get some frozen poultry

why would i be pissed
what are you doing here
i live here guess i do not have to ask what you are doing here
what is it
it is a sweep  c'mon
lemme put some clothes on
out there
no way
but i am afraid of
so you just decided to return it to the sender  or in this case the sender's wife
which is none of your businessor mine
it concerns only jah  but in this case i was the instrument of the most high
where would you clip this
i did not  it was a present from a guy
must think you are pretty special laying this on you
thought so  turned out he wanted me for something else though
same old story  not interested
what are you looking for
i ai not mad at you
i do not get involved with guns
i will make it worth your while
you are light a deuce
so max what do you do with all your money
i made you coffee  that oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little
thanks it is starting to kick in  i feel almost human

you did not
oh my god  in here  in here
damn are you alright
they took my daughter
your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet
can you help me get her back
if i give myself up in exchange for sophy would you make sure she is okay
we are not going that route  sonrisa's not someone you make deals with
what else can we do
goodnight bears  goodnight chairs goodnight kittens  goodnight mittens goodnight clocks  and goodnight socks goodnight little house  and goodnight
i do not want to move away
i know honey but just think how exiting it will be new house new school new friends
but why cannot we stay here
because we cannot  there's nothing here for us anymore
what makes you cry
if i am sad or tired or sometimes when i am angry or when somebody's being mean to me
pretty much the same reasons i was crying  but things will be better when we move to a new place
sophy  are you okay
mommy where are you
soon baby
mommy i am scared
you are a thief
girl's gotta make a living
thank god
first time i ever heard that
i was expecting someone else
guess it was not the pizza delivery guy
i am sorry if i caught you at a bad time
you have good taste  french 1920's attributed to chitarus
whoever that is
so what you liked it because it was shiny
no because it is the egyptian goddess bast
so this guy walks into a bar and says
original cindy say hi to my good friend
sorry about your window
lemme get my coat
how would you find me
was not that hard
so now you tracked me down  what d'ya think
too early to tell
how does mrs eyes only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list
one of my sources  her husband was murdered by edgar sonrisa
that is your shot in all this  being a famous anonymous underground pirate cyberjournalist cannot be much of a payday
fortunately my needs are met in that department
people had a choice even if they took it for granted  and now they do not
you accept the way things are you are an active participant in making it worse
ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time
i will not be staying
like following me around and pestering the people i work with was not bad enough but breaking into my apartment
it was open
you got a lotta nerve
you make it sound i pawed through your priceless collection of underwear
how do i know you did not
so saw my hands off i left you a present
am i s'posed to be grateful
that would be appropriate yes
how'm i s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything i own
whoa there tex  we have been through all this
it is alright peter we are fine
look if i made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out
yes on all counts
i have not been able to get you off my mind
you need to get out more
gold leaf art nouveau french early nineteen hundreds i could probably fence this for three or four grand
expensive gifts surprise latenight visits overthetop flattery you always come on this strong
suppose i could help you locate the other ones
the other ones
the other one like you
ltriptophanea neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures  then the lightbulb went off
we got separated right away  i never knew how many made it
how much do you know
i know they made me  even got the label on my neck to prove it
the technical term for you is chimera
yeaha madeup creature  like in mythologywith the head of a lion the body of a goat and the tail of
a girl
like extra virgin olive oil the best of the best
that is in it for you
your help
i did not make it this far by attracting a lot of attention
see you are back and still rocking the boat
i would have come sooner buti did not how are you doing
not in any painthe good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord
i am sorry
my mother used to say the universe is right on schedule  everything happens like it is supposed to
that is this
it turned up on the black market  one of my sources thought i might be interested
i do not know what to say
and i feel real bad about all that but it does not mean i need to get involved
you are involved  by being alive you are involved
and you still think you can do something to change that
i am looking for a lady who works here
know where i can find her
you do not want to
but she does work here
she may be easy on the eyes but she is trouble trust me  hot run to twoohtwo sansomme
i need to talk to her
max something  i got no clue where she stays
who is it
a friend of your fiance's
what do you want
who are you
my name's lydia  and it seems you and i have a lot in common
look i do not know what you want
well it is over between you and him we are getting married next month
how sweet  standing by your man even after what he did  you are a very understanding person
big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them
you are also a fool
this is not a place you wanna go
say the words i understand
i understand
i asked you to keep that thing outside
you did
you drive away business roaring in like that
yeah does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got going on here
guy says he made the trade in gillette wyoming sometime in the fall of ohnine
then what
then what  that is it  that is all i got
you were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks
nothing so far from arrests hospital admissions or coroners  this kind of searchit is heavy spadework  i am gonna need
i do not know what your story is and i do not want to
whoever tossed this place wants you  and i am looking to stay outta the line of fire
like you said maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations
hardware's too sophisticated  it is gotta be the government  and why do i think they are looking for you
you are crazy
i am sorry i could not come up with something more positive
i need a favor i need you to trace a number for me
sure you wanna be having this conversation over the phone
zero c'mon dan i do not have all day
got a pencil
just give it to me  i will remember
onesevenfourninefive natoma
craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him
what guys do  'nother order
you are way more philosophical than i could ever be
tell me the truth  am i a female fog bank
a little what
you know what i am saying
if i knew what you were saying i would not be asking
how long you and me known each other
a long time
long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right
because you are probably my closest friend in the whole world
and back at ya  only there's a part of you that is i do not know
a fog bank
you are actually gonna bail sketchy out
and because he is my friend
friends do not help other friends cheat
they are prisoners to their genes
so are dogs
they do not have a lot of moving parts
only one i can think of
yeah i can see to it your winning streak continues
not right now
not right now  okay when
right after you change your wardrobe your personality and drop about thirty pounds
i actually know how this works
who are you
and she bought that
make the call
she is gonna need to know that her little girl's alright
she is got my word
can you put that in a bag or something
it is payday need me to pick up your check
playing hooky again
feel like the dog's dinner
do not believe everything you hear on tv
tell everybody hey
quitting time  grab a cold one
i gotta meet natalie for dinner
right the big oneoh
hey sketchy
we gotta talk
lame selfserving arrogantguilty as charged
you left out condescending
but there's another side
here it comes  the part where the guy turns everything around
hear me out  this person i have been seeing is a jam pony client who happens to be married
and lydia telling natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way
i am a toy to her
fight fire with fire  threaten to go to her husband
who either does not care or could have me killed  either way natalie's still gonna find out
what happens if you level with her
even if she does not dump me which is unlikely she would never be able to trust me again
she tells you how i have been
i just do not want natalie to ever find out  she deserves better
how would you get her out of town
convinced her she needed to visit her mom in san mateo
i will give it my best shot
max what did i do to deserve a friend like you
you rock max  you rock
easy sketchy
no i am serious  that psycho got exactly what she deserved yes
lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but
okay okay okay
this is a hot run  beat it  you are late
i was on call 
i want you on call here
that is the difference if i am on call here or deployed in the field
more like deployed in bed asleep
i do not sleep theo asked me to pick up his check
and theo cannot pick up his own check because
he is sick
for a change
you tell theo he is not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job
what about this

that is that
ohhh that is lousy scotch
hey another shot for the lady and a double for me
what a man
hey you are a good quarterhorse kid but you cannot go a route of ground

miss farmer is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night

who are you
i live here
and that is the title of this seduc assault
i am not
yes you win them you bring them into your heart touch them but you do not set them on fire
but i want to i am trying
i need an incendiary an arsonist
then show me that is what i am here for to learn to grow
'but how do i know you love me'
how is it sound
the speech real good
you think i got it
you got it
yes ma
it is not in your hands mama it is my life
yes but important people are concerned about this judge hillier spoke to alma styles 
i do not care
it is okay
it is alright now little sister everything's going to be just fine
tell them who i am tell them who i am
and here's one from nice mr zeiss he says that
then why did you bring them
it is your fan mail little sister
well who have we here
oh mama i am so tired of that song
i think i need a little air
that is wrong
nothing i think i will just go out for awhile
where are you going
how long will you be
i will have lunch ready by one
i will be back
say you promise
you know the surest way to lose an appetite is to drink little sister
yes mama
i do not want you drinking frances
i am back mama
mama shut up
and now you are throwing everything away you are gonna be a nobody nobody you know what that is like
where are you going
i am going out
of course she has not anything definite in mind
oh just leave those things for now
do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath
i was hoping for a kind word little sister
you were hoping for a kind word you are my mother you are supposed to nourish me support me
on behalf of the seattle ladies club as a token of our vast admiration 
do not i know you
i do not believe so
sure you shouted at me in the auditorium when i read my essay
no my dear you must be mistaken
i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance
am i supposed to say 'thank you'
thanks are hardly necessary
aw shucks ma'am t'were not nothing
i am glad to see you have not lost your sense of humor
it ai not for lack of trying
so it seems may we be serious for a moment
do you expect me for one moment to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do
i see
besides i do not want to be what you want to make me
and that is that
normal average
all right will you please sit down now  symington says
did you really say that
just a little joke miss farmer
this whole thing is a joke
is there something else
i am sorry to keep you waiting the staff review ran over did you enjoy your mother's visit
yes it was very good to see her
she told me you said mama you want to kill me
i never said oh look that is just a figure of speech she said something funny and i said
and you accused her of tampering with your mail
i am sure you will see it my way in the end
symington says
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country
no no
i checked the files this one holds the record for shock treatments four hundred seventeen and no end in sight
you are kidding
some say that hessians are invincible
well now there's something worth dying for  what do you think
hmmm she is beneath me i am afraid
i am accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property
you would have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness
over three hundred miles
that is your frank estimation of the british
oh they have reasons there's a lot of confusion these days
go on i want to hear everything
congress is talking  openly  about replacing you with lee
is that a fact
what do you think george shall i resign  it is what they want
the army needs you
the army can survive without me
i hope i never have to believe that
we are so damned important  look at us  nathanael you were a horse shoer benedict before this
well george who were you
our plan is to hit them as they leave
that cannot be
as soon as the men have good shelters i will move  perhaps martha will join me this winter
have you heard  the british are negotiating to make a trade for general lee
colonel sir mrs washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner
you you just need a new flint general
you are never never to touch my guns  do you understand
yes general  but if you have to shoot somebody you cannot
none of the servants is to touch a gun  you know that
misunderstood what
a lot of years have gone by
what  what are you talking about
me  you apologizing to me
yes general
wil i am giving you your freedom do you understand
wil i want to remind you of a conversation we started just before monmouth
no uniforms  no coats even  in this weather
yes my lord
and is that a pitchfork beside him
because they have hardly any uniforms they designate officers with colored ribbons  my lord
by red what rank would you say this black officer soldier is colonel
general lee welcome back  i am happy you have decided to join us
i am to take command of major general lafayette's division and lead the attack
what the goddamned hell do you think you are doing
who is that
that is greene  he is supporting our reconsolidation
captain alexander hamilton sir
hamilton you are going to have to cover our asses as we cross
we have got powder but no ball
how old are you captain
i will be twenty next year sir
i will expect you for dinner this evening captain hamilton  for christ's sake have a bath
i am so inclined
general washington is there actually going to be a compromise i mean a  wouldeal' with england
with pleasure and an honor  did you hear about nathan hale
they are among the best divisions the british have  no conscripts no impressed recruits just professional killers
i was a clerk's apprentice on saint croix  but then i went to king's college
are you going to keep him sir
sir i think no such thing
do not lie to me hamilton  if i had not courtmartialed arnold
sir arnold is a traitor
i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect
what is this
this is a declaration of insurrection  who wrote this
george remember that night when we were drinking with arnold
i want to address the officers all the officers  next friday  can we arrange it at the mess
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention
i am not sure
george you are the only man the people trust trust with power they know you will not betray them
horatio  horatio gates of course you know john adams of the massachusetts delegation
who's in command out there
who the hell knows  everyone's giving orders  it is all very democratic
well john adams your cousin has a marvelous gift
with your support horatio  as one of our own who has seen combat with the british your opinion counts
colonel charles lee hounds and all  quite the character  he is got a tremendous reputation
they are friends of congress
makes you gag
gag on your own invention then
oh come now
i doubt arnold will be afraid
did god ever make such a pitiful army
i hear general lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in new york  why will not he come on
general lee is detained captain
detained by what
congress is bitterly opposed to allowing negroes in the army
we already have black soldiers in our army
unofficially general greene
any word from canada
spies from quebec confirm that the british are sending an entire fleet down lake champlain
my god they mean to finish us what about arnold  he is up there
colonel reed
a grand scheme
a ground swellchristian movement george you see
how many generals do we have like arnold  he is got guts  he is vain and he fights
and hamilton  greene
gentlemen let me get to the point i cannot see the wisdom of pursuing this old courtmartial against general arnold
the man is a traitor
arnold is indispensable do you understand  i need arnold to help me win this war
we have more officers created by congress than we know what to do with
i they look both the same
no please an advance on your salary
mon general i have come here to learn and to give not to take  i am serving without salary
'charming little victories' please do not expect much more of us monsieur
i only meant
these supplies
muskets and uniforms and bayonets
and how rusty are these muskets
well we will accept these charming little gifts  when we see them meanwhile please take your pick of a horse
i rode here on my horse
like flowers after the snow melts
what is it marquis
my god  who ordered this retreat
general lee sir
i feel the same sir
it is another demonstration against the king  this is the wildest yet
my god these people mean to go to war  they really mean it
our beloved father the king also refuses to bend
but to go to war over trade over money  surely there's still time for a compromise
of course if it were that simple  these people  they are after something else
my god what
but as usual it will not go well for them  martha you must trust me
i think i heard that
it is an antichristian dogma  i cannot believe you are so calm about it
what else  from virginia
that is the point of a revolution if it does not
some things must never change
is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men it is damned condescending
martha  for god's sake
leave me now sir i am tired
not today
i want you to see our hospital
we cannot take them  are you all right
we are leaving them
colonel washington  colonel nathanael greene rhode island militia
yes yes happy to meet you
but you do come from a military family
i certainly did not mean you  of course you are a gentleman an officer and a gentleman
general greene
i am with captain hamilton
they are just disgusting jealous bottomfeeding swine  it is their nature
i will not betray you nathanael
at one time i could have chosen not to be
well this must be about something
you know very well who it is that i love
george you know i only love you but
you remember george when we were 'studying' the great philosophers
really  which precious homily was it
think what the play means william perhaps these words have a place in the real world
where do those men come from george
africa of course
africa  that is so far  how do they get here
slavers capture them and bring them here
capture them  well i have never seen anything like it so of course i am curious
the word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus which is latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'
or 'civilized'
what do you really think of the minuet anyway
i always though london was the place to be  capital of the world the most spectacular city on earth
the place to want to be is america every english child dreams of it i dreamt it
it is the freest land on earth
is it  well i am scared of what we have become in our freedom
what are you doing
let's get you darker
you are out of your mind
why  juba was an african and you want to look the part  hold still
they can use their imaginations
i am lost in ecstasy  and dost thou love thou charming maid
remember george it is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong
that is good who
all people have rights
who says so
i say
i see
you hear that
the land here is best for grain and corn
my daughter i ask only
for god sake get that horrid stuff off your face  you look like a damned slave  it is damned humiliating
juba was a numidian
william we have been studying hard i really know my stuff
have you seen my blue spatula
nope what are you making pancakes
will you get off my back for once
it is tough to find a good job without any kind of training
how should i know
hi  look i am kind of tired  i think i will go to bed
i made spaghetti do you want some
i have some good news for you pumpkin
what is it now
are you still looking for a job

you can open your eyes now
oh uh thanks a lot enid i really appreciate it
arrrghhh ah jeez christ
are you okay
what is that
oh uh it is just this elastic thing i have to wear for lumbar support
what like a girdle
i am starting to think that even if i did get a girlfriend it really would not change anything
actually i have got a total crush on this one guy right now but it is a really fuckedup situation
are not you going to get that
wow  what was that all about
it is just somebody's idea of a joke
that did not sound like a joke to me what did you write a personal ad or something
uh yeah a long time ago she called before once it is just somebody trying to humiliate me
seymour i promise you that was not a joke  you have to call her back
how can you be so sure
uh hello

oh uh they were a present from dana
so that is it you do not ever want to see me again
no of course i do it is just that right now i need to 
that is her problem anyway  did she actually tell you you could not see me
no no not exactly she just does not understand how i would know somebody like you
what does she mean by that  somebody like me
just someone so young
you must have done something to make her think you like me
i i do not think so
does that mean you do not like me
no of course not
so do you like me seymour
in what way do you mean
i do not think you understand how i really feel about you seymour
what do you mean
what are you doing here

you need a bigger place  this is like a little kid's room
god she is going to kill me this bottle is halfempty
that is great halfempty  that is what i like about you seymour you are a natural pessimist
if you expect the worst you are never disappointed
what are you talking about you are disappointed every minute of your life
i hate sports
yeah but still it is kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that
i do not think i am in any condition to drive
i will drive then  we will go out in a blaze of glory
so where would we go
who cares let's just go that is stopping us
i dunno i
i am serious i am just so sick of everybody why cannot i just do whatever i want

i have changed my mind  that is the most romantic thing i have ever heard i do  i will
shut up  i am only trying to explain
i mean maybe you are right  but were you really expecting me to say yes

i am an idiot  i should have played the record first  this place is about to get burned down
rob here
hey  it is liz
that is happening
so the minister says nice things and then what we all troop outside and they bury him

you do not need the diary dad marcus has the map
there is more in the diary than just the map
all right dad  tell me
well he who finds the grail must face the final challenge
what final challenge
three devices of such lethal cunning
booby traps
oh yes but i found the clues that will safely take us through in the chronicles of st anselm
but what are they cannot you remember
i wrote them down in my diary so that i would not have to remember
half the german army's on our tail and you want me to go to berlin into the liongs den
yes the only thing that matters is the grail
what about marcus
marcus would agree with me
what did you get
you know sharing your adventures is an interesting experience
that is not all we shared it is disgraceful you are old enough to be her fa er her grandfather
well i am as human as the next man

i know dad
it is a new experience for me
this is intolerable
what do you think you are doing get down

only the penitent man will pass only the penitent man will pass
the penitent man will pass the penitent the penitent the penitent man
the penitent man is humble before god
penitent penitent
junior give me your other hand i cannot hold on
elsa never really believed in the grail she thought she would found a prize
what did you find dad
what did you find junior
i like indiana
after you junior
i knew you would come but my strength has left me
who are you
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it
that was seven hundred years ago
you are strangely dressed for a knight
get that camel out of the way
what happened to marcus sallah
that car belonged to my brotherin law
i am going after those horses
i will take the camels
i do not need camels
but indy 
sallah i said no camels that is five camels cannot you count
compensation for my brotherinlaw's car indy your father and brody 
where is my father
why are you trying to kill us
because you are looking for the holy grail
where is he talk  or you are dead damn it tell me tell me
if you do not let go doctor jones we will both die
then we will die
this is your last chance
all right where is my father
if you let me go i will tell you where he is
who are you
my name is kazim
ask yourself why do you seek the cup of christ is it for his glory or for yours
captain blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the natives
just a routine inspection tour
well mr prime minister my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in pankot
i am sure that will please the maharajah captain
interested in local curios
thank god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing
you think so
i am sure it is nothing just rumors  what was it they claimed was stolen
then she must have run out of the room and you found her
the plane crash and your journey here sound  most incredible
he is not exactly what we call a spring chicken
no no that is uhmed singh the present maharajah's late father
listen mr lal what do you call the maharajah's wife
his highness has not yet taken a wife
i sense the fumes of opium in all this perhaps miss scott picked up the habit in shanghai
i had a question mr prime minister i was examining some of the maharajah's artifacts
i suppose stories of the thuggees die hard
their stories are just fear and folklore
you know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them
dr jones in our country a guest does not usually insult his host
there you see captain a rock
when they lost this rock their fields and animals died they also said their children were taken from them
the newspapers exaggerated the incident
and did not the sultan of madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country
that was a misunderstanding
dr jones
lao she
you never told me you spoke my language dr jones
so it is true dr jones you found nurhachi
you have insulted my son
next time i will cut off more than his finger
that is that
now what about the antidote lao
wow holy smoke crash landing
step on it short round
you got the tickets short round
indy they make our plane crash to get you here
i ride with you indy
indy look
what you look at indy
that little maharajah think he big stuff
you do not like him do you
he was afraid of you he knows a tough guy when he sees one
get to sleep indy  i stay up and keep eye on things
what does it mean indy
the village knew their rock was magic  but they did not know it was one of the lost sankara stones
why they glow like that
come one that is wrong
slow on the curves or we will fly off the tracks
you were caught trying to steal the sankara stones
nobody can say you do not have a vivid imagination
that is far enough
give me the stones
no the stones are mine
on the way to delhi you will stop at pankot
pankot is not on the way to delhi
you will go to palace there
has not the pankot palace been deserted since the mutiny of 1857
it is pankot palace that kills my village
i do not understand that is happened here
the evil starts in pankot then like monsoon it moves darkness over all country
what evil
it is why krishna brought you here
was the stone very smooth  it was probably brought here from a sacred river
but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone
you will find them when you find sivlalinga
i like the service here
look out damn it i need that antidote
for crying out loud a kid's driving the car
listen we just met for crissake i am not that kind of girl
you do not look very good
what are we going to do where are we going
are you crazy a lift raft we are not sinking we are crashing
what would he say
he told me they knew i was coming here
what do you mean  how
the old man saw it in a dream
dream  nightmare is more like it

yes stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae
the what
oh  my  god  it is going to crush me
that is happening
it is starting to let go
thanks for nothing i hate snakes
where would you find your little bodyguard
shorty's family was killed when they bombed shanghai he was living on the streets
what about the future
i would like to find one of those myself
oh really
yeah but he is got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years  fortune and glory
the drawing shows a priest named sankara who lived centuries ago
what does the writing say
it is sanskrit it tells the story of sankara climbing mt kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva
i think you should sleep closer  i meant for safety
could not keep away huh
he is afraid of something
he said he could not take us any farther he has to go sell the elephants
any more complaints
i have always had a weakness for folk dancing
that is the maharajah  that kid
cheer up you lost your prince but dinner's on the way
not leftovers
you are nice listen i am taking applications  how would you like to be my palace slave
yeah  and nothing else  that shock you
primitive sexual practices

you have got to go to sleep now
i want to go home
so now they believe me
i was scared to death last night when i thought they were going to kill you
what are we going to do
let her go our only chance is outrunning them
anymore ideas
i guess mola ram got what he wanted
the last sankara stone
and they do not even know what it really is
i get it
this is the first time anybody ever cried when i left
give me your hat

miles how nice of you to see us  may i introduce howard d doyle of doyle oil
sixteen years howard jr is fourteen and mandy must be what  twelve

they say the massey prenup has never been penetrated
oh right will not you have a seat
so she is uh flourishing
i uh guess congratulations are in order
harvard whoa daddy

a wriggle room maybe we should put that in the malibu house screw the screening room
excuse me mr doyle if i could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment
what part
i would just like to have a word with her
i am here representing mr dumbarton on a matter of some delicacy
who's the pigeon
excuse me
is that one person
you are in a rush
whoever sent you i will pay double
lemme tell you something you are the pestilence i am the exterminator
well actually all whores worship the dollar if you want to get technical
who's next mrs rabinow
we rest your honor
she got absolutely nothing zero zip
so i will not be seeing her your clients usually visit me after the settlement
not this one not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery which incidentally she does not need
everyone needs plastic surgery you need it
i do not need it
you want botox
why in god's name would i want
no frown lines  new watch
it is a lecoultre revers you can flip the face and set it for two time zones
why would you need two time zones you never leave beverly hills
it was a gift from a client
set one side for bel air
botox christ we had aspirations when we were in college
we did not
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon i was going to clerk for the supreme court
i was going to play golf you were going to have asian girlfriends
you are in check
do you think i am going to end up like herb myerson with a colostomy bag instead of a family
got any symptoms
yes the inability to experience pleasure
the center counter defense the thing is not to move your queen too early
marylin rexroth she came into my office and signed a prenup with howard doyle
doyle oil  a massey prenup  she loves him
he is the wrong man
i am happy for you pal
thanks buddy
is she asian
asian no
i have it
you have the prenup
no i have the ring was i supposed to have a prenup
no you have the ring wrigley has the prenup
it is your move miles
he was rex rexroth's personal attorney
what do you mean was
i am sorry to hear that but you were not close were you
she is rich we are still married we have no prenup
who was that
marylin what have i done
mrs guttman you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirtysix years ever since you were married 
except for two years when he was in the navy in korea
prior to your marriage what was your profession
i was a hostess for transworld airlines
what is your husband's profession
so who would you hire
you like kids
why do you think she did it
maybe she wanted a free trip to la maybe they offered her money massey is very seductive who knows
i begged you to have a baby
you are vulnerable
you said 'yes' did not you
is tong older than ming
well he said to make the house mine
oh boy if he only knew
it sounded like a bell
 ruth rabinow this is rex rexroth and you must be mrs rexroth
how nice
these are yours
i assume this is on rex
your husband told me you were beautiful but i was unprepared
do you have a hard heart marylin
did you see the tape
not yet
tell me mr massey what was your performance about this afternoon
what does your lawyer think
ruth says you have been too successful that you are bored complacent and you are on your way down
but you do not agree
how do you know
why would you be here
i will have the tournedos of beef and the lady will have the same  i assume you are a carnivore
who ever lov would that lov would not at first sight
you do not believe in it
as a matter of fact i am a huge fan
you just have not met the right person
what is it you are after miles
oh i am a lot like you  just looking for an ass to mount
yes i loved my husband rex
and you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him
he will regret this
oh for the love of
that is true is not it miles your prenup is the best there is
getting married
to him he is a sick freak
he is passionate
passionate he is a pervert he should have to register when he moves
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time
but why him
the massey prenup has never been pene  successfully challenged
so i hear is that all
i would like to offer my congratulations that was a beautiful gesture of howard's
it was his idea it was a gesture of love and trust be happy for me miles
well when this goes south  promise you will have dinner with me
it has bones be sure to swallow one
to victory
i do not feel victorious miles i feel betrayed abandoned and humiliated i have pictures of him with another woman
more pictures my god marylin you can open an erotic art gallery
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs
yes marylin
you are right about me i am worthless i am nothing i do not deserve to live
screw you asswipe
marylin forgive me but are you  drunk
a little  you get out of the car that is right fuctard i am talking to you

no kidding i will bet you have some very grateful clients what would rex buy you
is that you
me yes
oh and that is  mom
yeah mom mom and brother
and your mother was very beautiful she must be proud of you
she never particularly cared for me
she held that against you
apparently she was very disappointed
and here i thought my mother was
your mother was
we are damaged goods
i have to say  i am speechless no i am never speechless
i am a little embarrassed i am not used to losing control with such  volume
and i am not used to  marylin  there's something i want to ask you
what is it miles
no that was not right i want you to be my wife
yes yes you do have more experience
yes miles i accept
you do
do you want to sleep on it
no ma'am i have been asleep all my life up to this moment marylin will you marry me
i do not have a ring
i know
was not she the judge at my divorce hearing
no judge  just a sec but marylin if we sign it i cannot hope to benefit from the marriage
oh miles
i am sorry i am squishing you i will move to the
honey i could sit
in fact this is not a married house  it is a bachelor pad
here's my card spend as much as you want we get mileage
well i suppose i could girly it up for you with a little fortuny and some passementerie 
good  are those foods
hello marylin
i have a surprise for you
you do not like me
i love you i want to have your baby
well well well look who made bail
i would just like to pick up a few of my things
what do you want
i want to nail you ass
are you threatening me because i am sure that is a violation of the terms of your bail
i am reporting you to the irs
i am clean with the irs i have reported every dollar i have ever made try again girlfriend
stuff  got a light
those are gifts
salary unreported income  by the way what time is it on bellagio road
meaning my house
i believe the residence will be part of the settlement
did our marriage ever mean anything to you
drop the bogus forgery charge and i will forget about your generous friends slash clients
that is blackmail
miles miles where have you been i have been trying to get in touch
you have to leave the house immediately
i will miles i will leave but miles 
no buts now out
just listen to me i am sorry miles it is true that my initial intention was to
please leave the house
i fell in love miles
so did i now pack up a few basics and 
wait he works for you
now but first he worked for you
you were going to have this thug
nonono marylin  i am your husband i would be entitled to rex's money no matter what happened to you
marylin run i will distract him
hello marylin
hello miles
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us
it is not something i wanted either
but then  i guess  something inside me died when i realized that you would hired a goon to kill me
you wounded me first marylin
your forgetting rex rexroth
you are forgetting howard doyle
forgery fraud
rex get away from the door
look marylin cannot we have a civilized discussion about this
are you alright you lost weight
do you need a tagamet
have you been taking your digestive enzymes
i am sorry where were we
i was devastated of course
forgery and fraud
you used his credit card
he never even asked he just assumed 
he was right was not he
so now what
you want to come out to the beach house tomorrow
i did not know barry had a beach house
she is a legend did not she do kravis or a pearlman she definitely did a factor
miles massey
of massey myerson
do you know him
who's she
please i am not seeing anyone until this is over one husband at a time
well what does he want
i do not know ruth kept her cool but i could tell she was surprised
lilly's up
every week 
so where are you now
nothing specific but i will have my own place soon
so marylin is that what you said when you were a little girl
you are not
sarah sorkin ramona barcelona  this is miles massey
but marylin without this you are completely exposed
is this ming
i cannot do this anymore let's get some lunch
he is not what i expected he is very  he is so  happy
but you are going through with it
yes yes it is just  you know i have never been the first wife rex was married before me
so what
miles is different he is still so idealistic
well that is about to change big time
he has no cynicism or anger for once i am not the repository of rage at some other woman
soon you will have your own rage
excuse me
herb wants to see me
mr massey 
please no calls i am feeling very fragile
i am sorry mr massey but i felt certain you would want to know  marylin rexroth wants to see you
marylin rexroth when does she 
so ruth how is sam
so miles if you have a proposal let's hear it
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation
my client has ruled that out
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice
that is delusional
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order
ha ha
 so much for the icebreakers what are you after ruth
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets
why only fifty percent ruth why not ask for a hundred percent
oh brother here we go
why not a hundred and fifty percent
are you familiar with kirshner
arty farty
he divorced his wife  he married marylin  he divorced marylin  and he  remarried his wife what kind of sick 
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle they do not like the way you operate they helped her
he never ate the prenup did he
i have no idea what howard doyle eats i am not a damn dietician
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
do not give me that crap that is my crap
and it is good
i will have you suspended i will have you disbarred
do not threaten me miles i did nothing illegal
where does that leave us
mr rexroth
thank you
well my wife has me between a rock and a hard place
you know what i mean when i say it
gotcha no need to get anatomically correct with me rex
i do not know i can assume
not in court you cannot has she retained counsel
i am not sure
that is kirshner
i think that went as well as could be expected
she always looked out for me
and she had private investigators assisting her
she brought my digestive enzymes
in anticipation of making you sick
sometimes i have serious doubts about you
i am very sorry
am i mentoring the wrong mentee
no you are not
what do you think
what are they
and i hear she is richer than croesus
ah but is she richer than mrs croesus
she owes me a meal
i would stay away from her miles
kenneth this is my associate wrigley wrigley this is my friend dr beck
the plastic surgeon i read about you in la style
i tried to reach ruth but we could not get her
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well 
yes  it is for your protection sweetheart you are the one with the  the
hi sweetie
no i have not but i have been out of town  hello rex hello there
you were never invited to meet your soninlaw
did you know mrs rexroth was married
let me tell you something about patty
ramona do not get mia farrow on us
three is not farrow
george was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second
it is not so bad these days kids like joint custody two sets of toys
thorstenson gieselensen he just separated from his third he is in fish he is fish
she is keeping his name and one of his planes and all seven of his children
that does not make sense it is like punishing you for being goal oriented

i mean why the sudden voluntary visit   usually it takes gun point to get you in here
routine i assure you  i just wanted to gage my health  am i healthy
yes  you are
i know what you are getting at
you do
i have seen it before
you should start slow and easy  fifteen minutes a day
you thought i sent them
have i forgotten something  is this a special day
the new store
honey i told you  if it makes you happy we should just do it
it is a tremendous amount of work  moving
what it is  is the truth
is this going to be similar to the flower incident
sometimes people need to see things done for them  because sooner or later they do not believe the words anymore
why do you polish that thing all the time
you are talking to me
then why
i do love you very very much
show me
walk with me
you like to take walks
it is one of those thoughts you keep to yourself
i thought we both wanted the same things
i have changed my mind
i want children
ellen there are two kinds of people in the world 
you can change
face it ellen i am not the type of person who reads bedtime stories but you love me anyway
it must have hit the window i think its neck is broken
it is not going to make it ellen let the poor thing go quietly
your father
he is plastered
i do not know
i think it is a different place for each person
if i die you will know where to look for me
go to sleep ellen
what did they ask
if i had seen you  by the way i am sorry about your wife  they told me
to where
pacifica california
from where
philadelphia pennsylvania
do you believe a persongs soul lives on after their death
most certainly
and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them
that is a reasonable assumption
i do not want my wife's soul having any doubts
doubts  about what
that is his story
his name is maurice  he is dancing around everything else
red flags man
not our problem
why so vague  why so evasive  he could be somebody hot
this guy's not a murderer
a marriage certificate  who the hell carries their marriage certificate around
hansengs whipped  has to call his wife every two hours or she will go ballistic when he gets home
i am going to drop off tandy at the station and then drop you back
shit  he jumped
jumped where
well hello

good morning
is it a boy or a girl
i do not have kids
you look so happy  how long have you been married
where did he go

confused  i am not sure what to do now  i am not sure what he wants for me
he wants to reward you that is why i am here
what do you mean
that is your shoe size
evening news
i have always wanted a watch like that
i really want that watch
fool's magic
fight's over before it is begun soon the survivors will be in full retreat
then we smash 'em
you go  not watch fun
fire moat why do that
we go out smash 'em now
birdies pretty
we watch good fun
more fun win battle
this is another victory my friends what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress
you go to lady now
my generosity is not so large as that
what do you want with me
your love
your words sting more sharply than your whip
i like well what i see  it pleases me
but i am hideous
you are magnificent
you lie  you wish to humiliate me as if the form i am forced to bear were not punishment enough
god protect me
not from me surely
you you are a beast
we are all of us beasts my dear only most are afraid to show it
and you are you not also afraid
i am afraid of nothing
then why hide behind a mask  you are ashamed
like some vile toadstool
i prefer to think more like the sagacious owl
do you feed on mice and rats
i prefer a plump capon but will happily serve you rats if they are to your liking
why have you brought me here
to be my bride of course
damn you
when the time's come you will not need to jump i will throw you out myself
do it now
your moans seem almost pleasurable my dear developing a taste for the lash
kill me i want so nice
sweet princess you begin to sound most reasonable
what do you want from me
we will get you cleaned up find a suitable gown i imagine you will enjoy a good meal
oh yes
a few day's nourishment will see your strength returning
what will become of me then
when you are ripe for my pleasure i will enjoy the harvest
i see
i am pleased you are not troubled by the prospect
do as you wish with my body you will never possess my soul
your soul  why should i bother with such a paltry trifle
you are a beast
what was that  did you hear that
it is nothing  my men take great delight in routing the enemy  do not trouble yourself beauty
it sounded like it came from the courtyard
from the parapets most likely  the men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving
might we watch too
and i with you i never dreamed life held such pleasures
and now
now i want to live forever  i have never felt so strong or happy
or looked so beautiful
yes  i feel that too  weakness is what is ugly
precisely my darling  your animal strength your primitive power has surfaced you are what you desire

aye honeythorn gump come to serenade you jack come to make you dance

oh but you will be jack think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night adancing
faerie ring
no  tis not the time  i want no part of your frolic
no i i need to rest
you will have a long long rest in the tomb me lad
i meant no disrespect
did not you now  well then answer me this riddle and all be forgiven
and if i cannot
damnation  codfish and cockles gammon and trotters  you have bested me jack
a riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you are thirsty for wine
you be our guest jack
i am honored honeythorn gump but no more tricks
you have me word lad  to answer a faerie riddle deserves as much
twas the princess lili gave me the answer have you seen her by chance
i have laid eyes on no mortal but you this day jack
elderberry wine  no finer drink under heaven
well i i do not want to be rude but it is generally known that 
generally known  what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots
please do not misunderstand  i am grateful for your hospitality and 
but but why
big question that lad  why what
why has this happened to the world why is it winter now and dark
aye  honeythorn gump would be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer
do not you know
then that is gone wrong  why did it happen
if ye want more tricks i am your man but for big questions ye must go elsewhere
there must be an answer somewhere
true but it will not come easy or free  if ye want to ask ask jenny greenteeth
will you lead me to her
are we here
aye  that foul wallow be where jenny greenteeth dwells  oona lure her out  play the part of a girlchild
what do i do
and if she thinks me a liar
the princess is dead
lamentable news jack but tis the fate of the living concerns us now
did you hear  twas the killing of the unicorn caused it
aye  black barongs mischief
if the horn be restored the curse is ended
time for a champion  can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests jack
i will do what i have to do for princess lili's sake
bravely spoke  you have the heart of a champion true enough
twill take more than heart  where do we find the armor of achilles for a start
there it be lad  the lindfarne mound  kings long forgotten lie there lost in their final sleep
have we turned graverobber then
a tomb it once was boy and a tomb it may yet be there's another in residence at lindfarne now
and who might that be
better pray the worm's a sound sleeper jack
you do the praying  i have work ahead
there's the spirit lad  if ye run into trouble give a yank here and we will haul ye up
there be no finer victuals than worm flesh lad
by the grace of god
what is it
pregnant is she
damn them
do not see why i cannot ride too i am second in command damn it
save your mischief for the black baron
aye  that too
you will need more than bird droppings for blackheart
i will drop a cow on the knave
finelooking army
we march on castle couer de noir within the hour
track the demon to his lair
we must follow that bird
whatever for
jenny greenteeth said  follow the raven in her flight
aye  said to follow it to the edge of night  but is this the right bird
i am sure  it spoke to me
how do we follow a raven we cannot even see
send oona up above the tree tops she be our eyes
aye  he is enchanted the lot of them  his reward for delivering the unicorn
foul fellow this couer de noir
the foulest  mayhap i can cut them free
worse than the battlefield
there it seems to quit i will wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing
well if the knight be already dead what harm is there in borrowing a thing or two
oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance
twould appear other travelers precede us
nay jack tis not what you are thinking
and this  some of their handiwork
nay  that is but to distract the casual visitor  a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly
nice piece of work
my god  look
something the matter
shhh  not so loud mayhap he will hear ye
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet
certainly understandable
i should hope not
i pray always to be worthy of it
we are not in a tournament gump  ah but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons
tis not the sword that counts but the man what swings it  rest easy jack
god protect you honeythorn gump
 this rate we will all be in our graves 'fore we reach the barongs fortress
we will surely be in our graves if we do not
god's blessing
what make ye of that jack
archers  bring down that spider i will deal with this other creature
is she dead
we will find it
easily said the raven passed this way hours ago
heading true north  we continue in that direction
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course
we will trust in faith gump
why not admit it honeythorn gump we have lost our way entirely
long as we do not lose heart jack
wait jack
hold jack  do not strike
nay  i show no pity to imps and fiends
aye  we be on a quest to set the world aright 
can we trust him
never felt so cold in all me born days
do not like the feel of it jack
give in to despair and all is lost
it feels wrong jack like a trap
there's more than one way to spring a trap
that be so better you pinch yourself now jack
on the morrow i will be awake enough to see if dreams come true
tells you something about him what lives there
we will need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders
why not mine the damned walls
a fine mess this is horrid nipping creatures what do we now jack
defend ourselves  we have bested far worse already
there are not enough arrows
water does not burn
and frog do not fly and bite like tomcats  it be magic jack powerful ogre's magic
there is not much time
been telling you that all along lad
what magic have we on our side
will you chance a miss
one more turn
have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory
aye  before the wee pesties attacked
then it is godspeed screwball
he will be atop the portculis ere long
best get down close to the moat lad
aye  we are good as inside
it does not matter
nonsense  course it matters
she is sore hurt jack tis true but not dead yet
the wound is mortal
nay  you have not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine
can you save her
easily the question is can we save ourselves  be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war
in the dark lad  why should he do that
because sunlight will kill him quickly now give me the key
sunlight you say
aye  hurry now gump the key
mean you to seek him out below
i am not afraid of the dark
did you bring me here to sup
nay lad we are here to collect a weapon you will need fighting the baron
plan on carrying some away in a kettle
will you explain that is going on
hey  stop it  i cannot see
cannot we move any faster
seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead
do not get too far
he is getting away  he was at my mercy
never show mercy
ride like wild fire jack
he will not escape me
a good day for singing
i have not heard a note out of you
not in the mood i am afraid
listen to him  not in the mood
on a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen a day so fair as forty springtimes 
i am not denying it is a joyous day 
where is your joy if you cannot sing
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst
she lives is not that worth singing about
by the pond  she was teasing me
go on go on
she tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it  said she would marry me if i did
and did you
nay  it was lost  when i came up for air the pond was frozen over
you must find the ring it completes the cycle answers the riddle
i will try
keep me belly full jack  kill us another worm
hush up screwball  do your own wormsticking if you like the taste so well
well done lad  stout heart
barely living from the looks of it
you see  you see
ogg lives there  and thurgis
we seek to undo the curse
well done lad
look at that shot  three at once i cannot miss
sweet slippers of oisin
someone like floki or squarefoot or 
aye my lord
start acting like you are worthy of this mission here  whatever you do do not dare drop it
nay sire i will cling to it as to life itself
how are these
greetings my lady the green wood is honored
these for me
but you did you did
blackheart  aptly named
a promise is a sacred oath
let's rest a minute  i am so thirsty
stop complaining
a gentleman would offer water
only were he a fool to boot  see yon viper
i detest serpents
that viper has envenomed the water no animal will drink here now
what shall we do
oh dear
i will go search for it
do not leave me now  i fear the unicorn will not show himself without you
i am not its master
the napkin will keep  i would rather not be alone
i am a princess  you have no right to order me about
such grace and their smell it is ambrosia
they rival the angels of paradise
oh jack might not i touch one  it would thrill me so
tis a fair question  if you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap
he will not flee if i show myself
not if you be chaste  tis an awesome test of virginity
i have no fear of failure  your implications are most unbecoming
where are you going
what happened
my father and the baron
they tricked you
my own father
how bad was the unicorngs wound
it happened so fast  he was hurt and ran away
he did run
oh yes and the mare with him
there are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood
i do not want it on me
its powers are strong
i do not want to be reminded of what happened
not even the birds sing sweet as you
jack green jack you must not flatter me so
tis the truth
a maid must beware of flattery methinks you want to kiss me
there's no happier thought under heaven
if i were your bride would the kissing ever stop  do you wish to marry me jack
my lady mocks me
nay jack i am but wary of your intentions
my heart intends no more than that you love me as i do you
i am afraid it may storm
let it  have not you a cozy bower we might hide in
tis not fit for a princess
be it fit for your wife green jack
i have no wife
then perchance you will me
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride
do you wish it jack  wish you this our wedding band
lili  no
what have i done
i thought you were dead i 
i was bewitched it is better this way
no  i will not let it happen
you have freed me jack
it is the barongs damnable work  too cowardly to stand and fight he used you to save himself
that is why he goes masked during the day
so he is hiding in the dark
in the dark where i join him
no  do not let go you must not  i love you
oh  green jack  what a dream i have had proper nightmare
sweet jack  i am so sorry you found me asleep  do not know what came over me
i cannot have been under much more than a minute
seemed like weeks and weeks  such a terrible dream i could never tell you
is what you said about the ring but another dream
oh no dearest jack i meant every word
you wear your weeds as well as golden armor jack  like a true prince a champion
lili i love you
that is the matter
ouch  something's biting me
biting you
pinching me
pinching  where
everywhere  ow
oona  do you suppose it is a faerie
honored to make your acquaintance
grand champion is it  and what great cause leads you to me
we seek the ogre baron couer de noir  he slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter
step lively now
sigurd's sword
well spoke boy  you have discerning taste for one so young just who might you be
they call me green jack ma'am
come closer then jack that i might give you proper thanks
think me fair do you jack
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you
the moon is too round of face methinks
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross  all the heavenly angels must envy your grace
a unicorngs been slain  the last stallion in all the country
here be the death weapon the unicorngs blood dry upon it
couer de noir  a demon if the devil ever made one
where do i find the barongs castle
follow the raven in her flight follow old black wing to the edge of night
not very precise directions
come sit beside me sweet boy and i will draw you a map
nay  tempting as your invitation be  tell me one thing more
ask away sweet man
what became of the princess
princess  i know of no princess
princess lili godwings daughter she was with me when calamity struck but after i could find no trace of her
is she fair this princess
exceeding fair
as fair as me
twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky
dead dead dead
i do not believe you
this is sad news be it true
do not be sad jack not with me here to give you cheer
tis not the time to speak of cheer
you will visit again
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom
courage jack
were i a mortal girl jack methinks i would be in love with you
then i would kiss you without turning my garments insideout and sewing bells all over
such a sad world be there no unicorns to brighten it
never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday
i am partial to oaks as are all faerie folk  may not i come visit sometime
i would be honored
only that
and charmed of course
fie  do not speak of charms  i should charm you for being so dull witted
i had no thought of offending you oona
do i not please you jack
in every way
and am i not fair
wondrously so
then why do you speak sweeter words to jenny greenteeth
that was in jest
jest with me then
how so
tell me i am fair as you did the hag
you are fair as the first new flower of spring
and sweet
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind
nay oona tis not possible
a faerie's love makes anything possible
i am promised to another
oona do not cry please you must not
and as barren of love as stone
i would build a wall around me with such stone so the likes of you might never enter
be fair oona
is this a may day pageant  are you all off on a lark  the raven passed this way hours ago
heading north still
the fastest in the world
what do we do now
that is she doing
i am in your debt screwball
praise be to god
master jack  master jack  these woods are alive  they are alive
up ahead
what can you steal from a man already lost his life
what care the bones when the soul is free
maybe there's a better idea what about birds get a lift from some friendly bird
have not heard a bird sing in days
hello jack
sorry jack
your fond wishes give me strength dear friends
how came you by this blade

had enough
you need a lift let's go to arcade and celebrate  your alert successor logan6
has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are
just wondered what happens
did you ever see francis8
i do not know what makes you so curious you have any idea who his seedmother was
you missed something special
you should have been with us in nursery daniel i am positive i recognized him 
now there's a few who could have been his seedmother
who invited you
that was a great shot you made
i just might look in on new you 483 myself
you why you are already beautiful
what the hell took you so long
did you ever see anybody renew
i think you have been skulling out too much first nursery and now stupid questions
did you
of course
anybody we know
look why do not you get into the water you need it more than i do
i am fine  see you
that is going on logan
it has nothing to do with you
why did you do that
i did not do anything francis they have made us believe that
it is him the first sandman he killed doc
that is your name
i am mary 2
why are not you in nursery
i am very smart
when do you go up
that is wrong available
no  just no
well then
nothing i felt sad i put myself on the circuit it was a mistake
sad what made you sad
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight now he is gone
yes probably he was renewed
he was killed
killed why do you use that word
is not it right is not that what you do kill
i never 'killed' anybody in my life sandmen terminate runners  who brought you
nobody i felt sad i put myself on the circuit
but you put yourself on the circuit
i changed my mind
about what
let's have sex  i thought you were curious
not about that
i am listening
i am afraid to tell you
i am not armed  well
why is it wrong to run
you should not even think such things  and you picked a strange person to say them to 
i suppose but what if you want to live
but if you are one of the misfits that is where i come in
i did not say that i would run i just
are you a 5 or a 6 
you could have called me yourself
but i was not sure you would come
i could not get you out of my mind
i am the most beautiful woman you have ever seen i suppose
maybe sure
thanks but i have the choice
of course
you can have any woman in the city what do you really want
you know
i do not believe you there has to be more
why show me
i am going to run
why tell me
you know something
about running dying what
both running's what i am interested in
i know what everyone knows try like hell for renewal you have the same chance everyone else has
it is different now help me
where did you get that
a runner gave it to me
and then you killed him right
i let him go believe me
i do not
speak to your friends for me jessica please
please what friends
i do not have much time
i never heard of a sandman running ever
are you here to help me
what are you going to do
that is tomorrow
i wish i could help you
maybe you will think of something
if you did know you would tell me
of course 
if you trusted me you would know
a runner cathedral a woman
you are not going are you
i would rather be with you
they are like beasts wild
some people say children need human mothering
insane nurseries are better than any mother could be
i have
when did you begin to question lastday
i do not remember exactly except i was a green  what would you like to relive logan
just follow  no matter how it seems
i am ashamed i was bringing you to be killed
where sanctuary can you take me there
logan i do not know where sanctuary is but if i take you to them they will kill you
all right but why i did not kill the runner
yes but they will not know that or care they are hunting you logan maybe me too now
that is nothing there's a sandman behind us too and there will be more soon take me to them
i  i cannot
then  why do not you leave me  go to them  explain
are you taking me to them
yes  i do not know what else to do  with him following us  why do you keep running from your 
because he is my friend   and i do not want to be killed by him  or anyone
they will not believe us
i would rather take my chances with them than with francis
they will not listen
you think sandmen will  there's no other way for me
how will they know we are coming
will you take me with you
how do we know this is the right way
what do you suppose this was
some kind of breeding pens i suppose they say people used to breed animals fish anything  to eat of course
i am afraid
it does not make any difference anymore
you are really one of us now are not you
you knew that i was not before did not you  why did you stay with me
i wanted to  and you what made you kill sandmen
i had to i did kill for the first time in my life i killed
that is that
it feels like breath it makes everything move your hair is moving
i hate outside i hate it
do not
it is getting dark and cold i am tired
do you think everything's going to turn to ice
i doubt it
do not ever let go
it all seemed to make sense until box
you are right it must be near now we will find it
what does it mean
you can have any woman in the city what do you really want
you know jessica
but i still have the choice
of course
they all have names and numbers on them i wonder what they are
look at his face and his hair  is that what it is to grow old
that sweet madman  how could he come to exist
he had a mother and father  and he knew them
there's a sanctuary there is
you want there to be one that does not
what are we promising him what can we possibly give him
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes
we cannot we are going back
to what
yes you and i jessica 
and sanctuary
beloved husband
what does that water do
it is part of the hydrogalvanic system the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow
is it inside the city
yes cats of course what else could they be cats of course each one has his own name too
are you sure
what kind of jewel is this
i do not know
what belongs to the people
all this all of it
what people
we will have to bury him
that is that
i will make the arrangements

the police
that is too bad i got a half million shares my whole foundation and now look at me
just call me barney
barney why should i never we have nothing in common hmmpf barney what effrontery
yeah you know
so that is where you are i might of known it no wonder you could not hear me
you were asked to have a glass of wine sit down
and be poisoned out here in the open
there you are
i am going to sleep in my bed come on lovey
they were in a quandary and
oh my is not that pretty what is it
charming chap
well that is that i guess
what are we going to do
it is better than freezing to death down below is not it
hey hurry up you slowpokes  i am starved
chalmers bryant
yeah i though you ran this joint
it is unbelievable
think of it in times like these
say you are an american are not you
hey that is happened to you
nothing why
look honey we run the pipes through here and we connect with the main water line here
pipes where are you going to get pipes
if you want me to
cave eh where
hey  look
i think i will stick around i will leave with the porters on their next trip
you mean you do not want to go
well  i am
i see you are afraid of going to jail eh
and mine's conway
where is your mad pilot
you will need suitable clothes for the journey it is not particularly far but quite difficult
and the wine  excellent
who and what is shangrila you
goodness no
so there are others
oh yes
who for instance
for a man who talks a great deal it is amazing how unenlightening you can be
there are some things my dear conway i deeply regret i may not discuss
you know that is the fourth time you have said that today you should have a record made of it
by the way what religion do you follow here
how about law and order you have no soldiers or police
oh good heavens no
you have no disputes over women
only very rarely you see it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted
they were
buy and sell
108 and still active
you are startled
that is all very fine if it works out a little amazing of course
why mr conway you surprise me
mr chang if you do not mind i think i will go on being amazed  in moderation of course
one moment you say the high lama is the only one who can give us any information
the only one
and he can arrange for the porters to take us back
the high lama arranges everything mr conway
yes i am afraid it does
shall we have another
charming is not she
yes charming
your brother seems quite fascinated by her
amazing  she still does not look over 20 when is she likely to grow old in appearance
not for years shangrila will keep her youthful indefinitely
suppose she should leave it
leave shangrila that is not likely you could not drive her out
no i mean about her appearance if she should leave the valley  what would happen
oh she would quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age
you must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey he could never get through that country alive
what do you want
i have offered you some warm broth i thought perhaps
please calm yourself you will soon be well if you do
i do not need any advice from you get me a doctor
i am sorry but we have no doctors here
no doctors  that is fine that is just fine
of course the porters will be very well paid  that is within reason
i am afraid that would not help you see we have no porters here
what exactly do you mean by almost any time now
you may not know it mr chang but right here you have utopia[15]
is not it is not it you know i was a professor for twenty years  and a very good one
i am sure you were when would you like to start
oh immediately
then it is done
oh thank you thank you
we were just going to bury him when you came along
in that event we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately some means to get us back to civilization
are you so certain you are away from it
as far away as i ever want to be
how can we get in touch with them
the high lama is the only one from whom any information can come
it is all your fault it was all arranged until he spoke to you why cannot you leave us alone
are not you afraid to leave you do not want to look like an old woman do you
are you taking me
sit here near me i am an old man and can do no one any harm
it is astonishing  and incredible but
that conway seemed to belong here in fact it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here
that i be brought here who had that brilliant idea
sondra bizet
oh the girl at the piano
yes of course your brother is a problem it was to be expected
the power house  they have blown it up the planes cannot land without lights
all right go ahead  we go on to the next plane bring out any people that are left
bob these are all that are left
hello freshie did you make that report out yet
yes bob
do try to sleep bob
oh stop it
george what are you going to do
what are these people
what is it has he fainted
what is it
that is it mean
hello george  cigarette
thanks  i suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure
what are you talking about
what do you mean if we should get out
did i say if
that is what you said
well  i mean
well  i heard that if you want a mangs wife she is yours if he is got any manners
good heavens bob we have been here two weeks and we have not found out a thing
george what do you think you are doing
george come back
let me up let me up
did not you find out anything about the porters
for heavengs sake bob that is the matter with you you went out there for the purpose of
george  you are behaving like a child you have not opened your mouth in two weeks
you cannot leave george
why not that is going to stop me
well i  i really do not know what to say except that you must be completely mad
is that all my story meant to you
what else could it mean to me it is obviously a lot of bunk
i am tired of owing you things you are free to go go ahead
it is that girl  that girl has twisted and turned
oh george   
besides i  i do not feel like making that trip alone bob
george you could not possibly stay here could you
george are you sure of the porters about their taking care of you i mean
yes the little russian girl
that is she got to do with it
you cannot take her away from here
what do you mean  fade away like an echo
this would be funny  if it was not so pathetic why she is not a day over twenty
the clothes
yes everything
what was that
was saying
bob cannot you get them to wait for us they are leaving us farther behind every day
target practice again one of these days they are going to hit us
where did you come from
i am alexander p lovett sir
where were you hiding
hiding oh no hunting  i was in the interior  hunting fossils this morning i looked up suddenly
no that is not possible if we had landed we all would have been awakened
of course we never left the air i know  i did not sleep the whole night long
that fellow got on at baskul
what if he refuses
we will smash his face in that is what we will do
i guess we are in for it
you mean to tell me you are not going to do anything until we land
what do you suggest
imagine having all that fuel there waiting for us  george something tells me our journey is just beginning
huh i give it up but this not knowing where you are going is exciting anyway
at the mercy of a mad pilot
oh please i hope you are not going to run away this time
my name's sondra
you know each time i see you i hear that music what is it
was this your idea
yes hold this pigeon
you suggested my being brought here did not you what gave you the idea i would fit in
that was easy i read your books
oh you have read my books you do more things what have my books got to do with it
i saw a man whose life was empty
father perrault i envy you i talked to him last night
yes i know
i am thirty
perhaps because you have always been a part of shangrila without knowing it
goodness no from what you tell me about it it certainly does not sound very attractive
oh the usual reasons a world full of people struggling for existence
struggling why
would you like to wring my little neck
could not you arrange to make a little less noise
i tell you we are going west and shanghai is east of here
be quiet fenner's the best pilot in china he knows what he is doing
what do you want him to do
what is it
that is what i mean  mysterious mr conway i do not like that man he is too vague
how about you do you want to go
go where
home away from here i have got porters to take us back
oh my dear boy i am sorry that is impossible why i have my classes all started
i do not care what you have got started do you want to go
well  no  i think i would better wait yes yes i will i will wait
you will wait till you rot
excuse me
you promised to come for tea yesterday i waited for so long
i am sorry  i have not even got any cigarettes left
please say you will the days are so very long and lonely without you  please   
all right i will be there
the hell happened
hesitated sir
you shot an eight year old girl
uh yes  apparently i did air
the hell were you thinking
well i dunno  i mean when you looked at all the other options it just seemed sorta obvious
so this door  it is not an exit  
touch that
what the hell
kids' game a couple galaxies over
i guess i lost
we have one motto peace on earth
and goodwill toward man
no just peace on earth
once i thought the biggest thing i will ever do was guard the president
your supervisors have no idea why you are here
well you know when you say normal what exactly
for instance  it says here you lost your parents at 15 and since then
sir  i thought those records were sealed
only the damn guy will not know it
his physics are a little different than ours  do not worry
it will make sense later
sorry cowan i found out literally just before the ceremony' apparently you are to report for further review
further what are you talking about air  that makes no sense i hold three cadet class records
well this did not
actually sir
cowan  do you ever think that maybe just maybe other people might be right and you might be wrong
all the time sir
you do
which do you have your money on dee
i would go with number three
oh shit it is in the car
i was not scared
grab the coffee will ya  i told zed i would give him a buzz
listen do me a favor do not mention the 140 thing
helluva night is not it
we will take it from here
what  who the hell are you
pasen alfurgon v larguense de aqui take the van and go
sir you cannot just
why  what are you gonna do
well how about if i guess then black vast space  deep spiritual the essence of infinity
the point is to not call attention to ourselves
it is the way we do it  the way we have always done it
i know but we are on a college campus
keep her out of here while i check it out
i am just saying it was cold  i think she kind of liked me
such a shame too  cause you made such a good impression the first time
hey i was working her  i was working my thing
just so i understand you are thing is acting like an idiot  or is it actually being an idiot  besides
i know i know  i read the manual no attachments  we work alone blah blah
if you do not have anyone to tell you will not tell anyone  believe me you get used to it
i think you are too used to it  if you ask me you have been doing this job too long
you do not know the half of it
what would you do before this anyway wait let me guess ice sculpture rock
i taught kindergarten
ha ha  no really
you do not know me at all
kay um how uh fast does this thing actually go  
if it was just a meal why did they have so much luggage
i dunno  maybe it was baby supplies kay starts the car starts to pull a uturn
i guess it is simple huh  they are either gone or dead
or someone has a nitrogenizer
a signazoid's eleven thousand pounds i think we would know if held left
then would not we also know if he is here
something's wrong here
gee  you really think
jeebs is eager to have me deport him but would rather kill himself than go downtown why
i dunno why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner
why did mikey leave nazca
looks like a train ticket
that is going on kay
i do not want to rattle you but dee was here for the war of the worlds
the radio show
no the aliens organized all of them and tried a coup they made it seem like a radio show afterwards
you think that is that ishappening
ernie goose  cynthia
jesus christ
where is it coming  where is he landing
perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs
oh yeah  fill us in why do not you
what if he is telling the truth
he is here to help
yes  well in his own mind yeah  what if from his point of view he is
how does that help me
kay  all i am saying
i know what you are saying  and i am telling you i do not trust him
since how long
maybe they did not get here  maybe they have been here
we saw it in the office  it went from this big    to big   in a day
it is marble
would you call this a code 100
do his job
wow this one's cool  and it looks just like a shotgun
actually it is a shotgun  hold onto it
in case i need it
you were saying
after i got the shit beat out of me
and i almost got digested it goes with the job
you coulda told me what you were doing
who's she gonna tell anyway she only hangs out with dead people
not her me    they are beautiful are not they the stars i never just look anymore and they are beautiful
kay you are scaring your partner
i have not been training a partner  i have been training a replacement
i am just wondering that is so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it
yeah  his dream and our worst nightmare
i put word out you know how long it takes to get the signals across
so how would you hear about this
oh yeah well you know  i am a big fan  i have read all your work
right right i like that stuff
with exclusionary frectoinhibitors
exactly  i very much enjoy that
once just once i thought i would made the discovery of a lifetime
why not
i swear to god that was not here two days ago
but it is definitely a nest is not it
it would have had to have been recently within a few weeks
what do we do
what do we do    lean into it
what the hell does that mean
is it my eyes or is that thing a little
the only thing i could think of would be you would have to get rid of the queen
what if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is
what are you doing
the kid looked desperate  i figured
your licence is revoked permanently
and i am arranging deportation papers
yes  yes that is eminently fair of you
let's go jeebs  downtown
i dunno one
try seven  from unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident  you wanna tell me that is going on  huh
it is coming
so now what  cattle call again
we have got about eight or nine prospects	i want you look
nothing at all  now  last month anything in the last few years
i know what this is    zed you in
yeah kay
did our friend announce when he is making his speech
noon exactly
did he say where
actually yeah
would not happen to be the lincoln memorial would it
how would you know that  kay
listen to me you are holding something very very dangerous you have just iced 350 of your pals
they are not my pals
they are not even gonna be your enemiea if you do not give that to me really soon
what if i do not
in about 10 seconds they are gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute
found it
tell us the truth  you do not just find these things at least not in this neighborhood
we are from scientific american  we read about your discovery  we would like to take a look
this it
i mean i dunno  i have seen insects with really great camoflauge ability  but never like this
hmnn wall it is funny cause usually i am not all that attracted to stupid guys but
we need to talk to you about the alien
which way
really nice wheels by the way
how is dee
jupiter actually well one of the moons
kay  that is your 20
highway 119 just west of smith why
i need you in philadelphia  i got a code 90 in ahigh school
he is gone too
even that little bug you found in sudbury seems to have taken off
jesus everyone's moving  could be an assembly  does it look aggressive
hard to tell  i hope not
they are gone
i am getting a trajectory
and they are buying it
they went right to the president
well it was not in the jar
did it leave
actually i do not know
how would you know
now what are we looking at  keys  look at them all  why do we have them  mr president
if i may sir what exactly are you offering
a good question  and a simple answer  no more hunger  no more smog no more overpopulation  no more war
drop some money
forget that guy 
no  follow him
he will turn around
he is here
oh god
please i want to go back
i cannot leave  you said so yourself there is no minority report  i do not have an alternative future
where are we going
someplace safe
the other two will die without me
agatha you are never going back there
cannot you see  she just wanted her little girl back
who wanted her little girl back
the drowning woman  anne but it was too late  her little girl was already gone
she died
she grew up
she is not alive but she did not die
 but he did not
then who was he
just some guy they found
think john  why would they set you up
because i found out about her
about who
i am so sorry i just want him back i want him back so bad
john  what is it
and replace them with new ones
that is not much
you do not remember me do you
we know each other
from where  dc
i put you away 
yes you did
you made those tapes
they were performance pieces
there's food in the refrigerator make sure you drink a lot of water
it goes from the bathroom to the kitchen
i cannot even stand up 
i know you are in a hurry so i juiced up the nanoreconstruction around your new eyes
you the sentry
i do not ever see any of you precops down here i am not in trouble am i
no you are not in trouble  i am interested in a murder
that is an old one  one of our first
this is the official composite of the three precogs
that is right  it is a combined data stream based on all three previsions
show me just agatha's data stream
you the only sentry
hence the expression
 graveyard shift
why's he still a john doe  why was not he ever id's from an eyescan
huh we do not seem to have her data
hey you wanna know where the word came from glitch
tell me not to worry john
do not worry lamar
has the observer from justice shown up yet
and this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it
lamar i am sorry  i do not know what 
i need you to do two things for me one watch danny witwer
i understand  that is the other thing
danny witwer is scheduled for a tour of containment tomorrow 
so give him a tour  he does not know enough to ask the right questions
if he is looking for a flaw in the system 
she is worried about you  and quite frankly so am i
i am fine
i hear you have been spending a lot of time in the sprawl
i go running down there
what if danny witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run
you understand john that the minute precrime goes national they are going to take it away from us
we will not let them
just so you know i have overridden the vehicle locator  i just wanted to talk to you before justice 
justice already knows  talk to me john  tell me that is happening
this is all witwer  he is setting me up
stop  just wait  who's the victim
somebody named leo crow
all right john just take a breath let's think about this
i am out of breath  i am a fucking fugitive
then come to my house  we will talk 
i cannot  they are following me right now  they will meet me there they will halo me
how could witwer have accessed the case file
john  please  listen to me 
i am not getting halo would
you cannot run 
people want to believe in the system  that is the beauty of it
no doubt the precogs have already seen this
no doubt
seventeen minutes
chief the investigator from the fed is here
you are kidding that is today
uh sir
victims are pronounced here killers here  we never touch anything
do not run chief  you know we will catch you  you trained us
everybody runs
you do not have to do this chief
okay jad that is coming
we cannot grab it
somewhere near the capital
no maglev system
look at the kid  in this one he is on the left of the man in the suit
yeah  so
go ahead
jad  how come you are not out there with father witwer
red ball
nope  somebody's thinking about this one
i have got no address  last known or otherwise  no tax returns for the last five years
i show time of occurrence friday at fifteenzerosix hours
confirm with trig and image
any id on the shooter yet
uh yeah you mind getting me a piece of that cake they are eating down there  i am starving
sure chief  i think i will grab one for myself while i am at it
i am sorry danny but i will have to give you the full tour later on
as i recall they outlawed compression firearms in the district ten years ago
they did  make yourself comfortable  we will be back in an hour
but it is not the future if you stop it  is not that a fundamental paradox
why did you catch that
because it was going to fall
the precogs do not see what you intend to do only what you will do
it was iris hineman  she developed the precogs designed the system and pioneered the interface
speaking of interfacing i would love to say hello
to them
cops are not allowed inside the temple
really  you have never been inside
we keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering
so i will be the first one to go in then
maybe you did not hear me
if it is a question of authority
there's no question  you do not have any
i find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs
the precogs are pattern recognition filters nothing more
but you call this room the temple
you set me up
it seems i have found a flaw john  you
you gonna tell on me
her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system what did you do to her
she was looking right at me
she spoke to me
to you  i do not think so  what would she say
wally listen to me
are these all of her previsions
just go to the beginning
i need your help
well hey you did not have to come all the way down here  for you chief i make housecalls
i need help with her
rufus  she is a precog
she is a precog
are you reading my mind right now
i tell you what  i do this i get to keep whatever images i get from her head
they do not belong to anybody
what happened  where is the rest
rufus play it back
i scored a goal
i won
four  wow  what a big boy  i love you sean
okay now let me time you
are you kidding  there's absolutely positively no way on my best day i could ever beat twelve seconds
come on
sean  you are not real
you gotta have faith dad
it is a little late for that
wanna hear something funny
you are alive
no  he got tired of pretending
oh sean 
i feel bad about that  i need you to forgive me
i forgive you
once i even told him i loved him
i forgive you
the more you want to believe something the easier it is to be fooled
i wanted to
who are you
i am your son  i am you
sean wait
six years ago  baltimore  you grabbed a kid at francis public pool in the west end
do you know who i am
some  somebody's father
where have you got him  is he all right  tell me you fuck  where is he
but you have to  they said you would
the precogs were wrong
you are supposed to kill me  he said you would
look i have put my family through enough misery  you gotta kill me this way i can leave 'em something
crow  i am not gonna kill you
look believe me i know it is hard but you gotta do it 
what about the picture 
fake  he gave it to me  now    shoot me goddammit before i lose my nerve
tell me who was it set this up
if i tell you my family gets nothing
who made you do this
kill me
let go of the gun
you are not gonna kill me
something wrong
yes i am afraid that would be from the doll's eye
the what
just what is it you think i can do for you
you can tell me how someone could fake a prevision
you do not seem all that proud
i am not  i was trying to heal them not turn them into something else
heal who
the innocents we now use to stop the guilty
you are talking about the precogs
i am not a murderer  i have never even met the man i am supposed to kill
and yet a chain of events has started  a chain that will lead inexorably to his death
not if i stay away from him
how can you avoid a man you have never met
so you will not help me
jesus christ  why did not i know about this
you are saying that i have halo would innocent people
i am saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might just might have an alternate future
answer my question  did lamar burgess know about the minority report
the system would collapse
i believe in that system
i am not gonna kill anybody
hold that thought
what safe place is that
if you have one
 and then walk out
actually i think you will have to run out but yes that is what you have to do
i will get eyescanned a dozen times before i get within ten miles of precrime  they will pick me up
how do i even know which one has it
it is always in the more gifted of the three
which one is that
he is dead lara
oh god what did you do
nothing  i did not kill him
this is all my fault
i have not worn this damn thing in years  i just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight
it is insanity around here
anne lively  john was talking about her right before they took him
john said something about him being set up because he found out about her
we know why john was tagged
the guy from usa today is here
tell him not now
he just wanted a few minutes before 
sir the press conference is starting
congratulations sir
how did you get this
you have an emergency call on your private line
why are you protecting him  you knew he was doping yet you did nothing about it
the man lost a child for christ's sake
six years ago  what did you two talk about yesterday afternoon
shall we call the attorney general i am sure he would be happy to clarify the issue for you
i do not wanna say over the phone but i think we may be chasing the wrong man
good god  what was that
it is the same prevision
now the second image  watch the water  the wind's changed  the ripples are going the other way
i do not understand 
danny tell me what you are thinking
precog deja vu
i wanna kill my boss
uhhuh  okay  you got some images i can work with
right here
uh yeah being concert master of the philadelphia symphony orchestra is one of our most popular choices
no i wanna kill my boss
this is evanna the team pilot
so if you wanna kill someone you take him to miami
cannot they shut that off
do not worry  i will bring him in unharmed
sir the team's gonna be light without those men
there's thousands of units like this one
no offense sir but why would not he just run
it does not matter  he wins
we can stop him
he is trying to prove his innocence

i think it must have been a sea gull
a seagull that is a seagull doing around the city hall that is a bad omen is not it 
me more than most
why are they ganging up against me
i said you must come out to the house for dinner on thursday
really you think so
 the argument had nothing to do with it
i understand i just want to know what the argument was about
i had ordered some books the 100 greatest books ever written
one hundred books
it is irrelevant it had nothing to do with what happened
i know my time's up but i have got to get this out while i have got hold of it 
you can go out there if you like

why not
mr follett do you trust me or do not you
well i do not know i only been seeing you 
without trust there's no point to any of this you might as well not come
now hold on i did not say i did not want to come 
or maybe it was not an accident at all 
mr follett
stop now
why i am paying for this
not for this not me you are not
you find it distasteful do not you
it does not matter how i feel about it it is how you feel about it that matters
i enjoy it does that make me some kind of pervert just because a man has a rich imaginative life 
you came because it is taking over you are in its grip
where is your wife henry

i was never satisfied
that is that
what is it
it is a thought i had
let me just say something here i have no idea if this is going to help

i feel like we are making real progress here
i did not see you there can i help you

i want to give you something will you let me
thanks lily i do not need anything
here it is some advice  do the hard thing
that is it that is what you are giving me
what it might take is doing time
but it is not really my school  and this is very interesting  it is the school from the next district 
 you crazy you cannot do this
do not you at least have a back door i can use
maybe some of us do not need this crap
it is a country club do not worry about it

dr mumford does yes i have put myself completely in his hands for today anyway

phd psychologist
oh not a real doctor
what would you want
finally some common sense

well you see the problem is 
wow you are something
well look who's here
good evening mrs cook
just who is here can you tell me

hmm as in  that is interesting sometimes with enough clues it is possible to figure these things out
what would you do
we we would try several things but i need to see you a lot
i do not know i barely made it today
we will take it slow you will never feel you cannot handle it
i do not think i can afford it i do not want my dad paying
you have the best answer for everything  you seem so hopeful are you always this sunny
no one ever thought so you must bring it out
is it contagious 'cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down
i am not making any promises
we will turn back anytime you want
mom's such a cutie
maybe but you are the one whose ass is dragging
is that the technical description of what i have got
is she against you getting help
we do not discuss it
okay then are you positive your mother's a bitch  just kidding
you have got a funny idea of funny
is this the treatment
sorry i am done
i am embarrassed the list is so long
painful lymph glands  forget fulness irritability depression
yes yes and definitely yes also i get confused
i do not know if i mentioned the headaches
did you get headaches before this  but you get more now or more severe
no not really they are about the same my marriage was one long headache
i can give myself a headache instantly
sometimes yeah pulling in two different directions at once it makes tiny little tears in our fabric
you are doing great
i do not know if i am going to make it the whole way
who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me
and i will bet you can interpret the whole thing
so whose route is this
brady peck's fourteen years old lives next door
and he is where
you like it
it is all right
then you can expect me at 530 tomorrow morning
and this is legitimate therapy
that is what i like
which thing
either one
why would you come to the house the other night
i thought i had something to tell you but it turned out i did not
my brother said you were about to fire me
i need to talk to you doctor can i come in
it might have been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctorpatient relationship
is something wrong sofie
yes something's very wrong dr mumford
you are upset
i am glad
given that i am obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way
i guess you saw the show
part of it we were watching er until someone called
how violated i feel
you feel violated
not me all my other my patients i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here
but nothing i am mad as hell this is a terrible thing you have done
will you think about it
i do not know depends i am in a bad mood
but first you have to tell me something
anything just ask
you got off easy
will you wait for me
we are only talking about six weeks
will you be here
what do you mean in no time
in maybe three or four issues
weekly or monthly
monthly god how shallow do you think brad is why do i waste my time telling you this stuff
why do you think you tell me nessa
do not do that thing  that shrink thing
the school board does not pay you what kind of deal is that
it is called pro bono
pro boner  pro bono huh for whose good supposedly
you been spying on me in the supermarket nessa
is not she amazing that is such a wicked look
what do you want me to see
what are you doing we are not done i just need to find the thing
what happened today
what are you talking about
was it something that happened at school
these appointments were not my idea remember
what would he say
what did he want you to do
what balls on this guy what are we  going steady jesus
you are doc mumford  skip skipperton
how are you
would you like another beer
nah scotch
can i ask you a personal question
of course that is exactly what i want
is that the question
i understand
i have a lot of money do you know how much money i have got
do not tell me 'cause i am not going to tell you what i have got
i have got three big ones
i am impressed i could not make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes
this is great
this is exactly what i wanted
okay then  have you got a lot of friends
lily and i talk a bit you know lily runs the coffee shop
no i have seen her goodlooking woman
she is probably ten years older than you
goodlooking woman
lives downstairs from me she is got a great dog named for danny ainge
really i am the only person i know that likes danny ainge outside of celtic fans maybe phoenix
unbelievable  and lily named her dog after him far out
so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours he is my pharmacist
hey skip
doc i know we are not supposed to get together till wednesday
sometimes it is best to keep a few things just for ourselves
you are a shrink doc are not i supposed to be able to tell you everything
yeah well what i was gonna tell you 
guess  go ahead guess
slash what
sexual surrogate slash companion
how is it coming
you do not think i am insane
and that is your secret  you meant  like a trade secret

skip that is not much of a secret
who else knows
just you
damn what is your name
does not matter you can call me doc
i have told you a lot of private stuff
i can tell you anything else
but there was one job that looked like it might be fun  investigator
 an investigator for the internal revenue service
everybody has a story skip
an irs investigator with a drug problem
it was not the best situation
of course him being insane did not make it all right that i fell in love with his wife
get to know your therapist
you were messed up man
but look at me now
at least you pulled yourself out
things got a lot worse
somebody's taking a shower down there

where ya going i have got a million questions
i have never brought anyone down here before
skip i have got a problem and i need some advice

this does not seem a little perverse
there are a lot of lonely people in the world somebody's gonna figure this out someday
it is all your fault in the last 48 hours i have completely lost interest
i guess that makes sense
it is possible i do not know about that
oh yeah very tough but i guess that is good to keep out the quacks
which examiner did you have i probably know him
that was a terrible thing
he was a cool one that harper never broke
what do you figure he done with it

i do not follow
you did not just say injuns del
the indians injuns whatever they are always drunk and doing stupid things
like what
driving their cars into trees puking on the sidewalk stupid shit
let's see around here that would be kiowa kickapoo or osage if i am not mistaken
oh jesus please please god
bourbon little water thank you
hey you got a fine one right here
relax we brought the cash
no that is ignorant they just do not know any better
that is right
stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are by their very nature untrustworthy
now that is really stupid
are you out of your mind you scalped him
you told me how to do it
this is great  just great now we do not know where the goddamn stuff is
he told us it is in the buick
we do not know which buick do we
well why would you shoot him
i did not you gave me a look
what 'look'
it is not here let's go
you just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this
why not it will confuse 'em gotta do something now that you fucked it up
we can live with that
del's dead by the way i sent him to the great beyond
he is telling the truth he does not know
should i kill him now
what the hell was that another statement
well no one ever spit in my face before especially some cracker fuck
i hope you are right

betty betty betty
like us
wise beyond her years i am sure and such poise too  very very impressive
okay thank you goodbye keep in touch
i know that
that was a really shitty thing to do
i dunno something  why is she doing this to me why
how would they describe her
you know blonde thin whatever
one of the seven natural wonders of the world
every american should see the grand canyon are you an american
well guess what i found betty where she is been anyway
where where is she
this does not look like the kind of place betty would go to
so you believed the bartender why
wait wait wait a minute that does not make sense
what does not
you gimme this bullshit psychic friends theory you believe that dumbshit trucker you believe this woman
'cause i just do not buy it call it instinct call it 35 years of professional knowhow
i call it 'nutty' as my shit after i eat almond roca
who's this
what in the  what the hell is this you have been holding out on me all this fucking time
it just did not fit her profile
fuck the profile that is the same guy
she cannot be here because of a a soap opera not a soap opera that would make her
crazy no shit shaft and you ai not far behind
man you have got to get some therapy
i said 'got it'
yeah i got it  come on you are stretching out my vest
you were right del was not lying
what do your instincts tell you to do now kid
it is to follow my instincts and my instincts say get the fuck out of dodge
this is betty at twelve
very graceful perfect form
what do you mean
and how long did she work here
oh five years give or take
hmm you two in high school together
are not you a sweetheart no not quite anyway she is been with us awhile
i see  may i
if it helps bring her back be my guest
thank you for your cooperation  just one more thing did she ever talk about getting rich
what would you get her
seems like a nice place
jesus christ
he is waiting
funny that is just what i was thinking
i know george i was there i am not denying that she is good
she is even taken a job as a nurse  david ravell's getting boring lyla
we know that
can i have an evil twin
no george we have already done that with lonnie the blind one last year remember
oh of course who can forget the emmy  then let me bring betty to the set and see what happens
i do not know george
i will tell the cast ahead of time what do you say

jesus do not do that if it gets around that you fired me i will never land a pilot

ahh mercedes i think black
and she always had such spirit but after her mother died
you have got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone that is not our betty
why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody
because it ai not natural young man
you are wasting your time roy
nothing complex about it del's dead betty's gone she is probably dead too
you would like that would not you you have hated betty since you were in pep squad together
what did you say
the driver was killed i think there's a connection

probably the same thing my mom would do if i got engaged have a heart attack
so tell her to settle for the old one in orange county
she is gonna have to 'cause i am out of ideas
maybe we are suing him for malpractice that is his name again
david ravell

you believe that
you stole my boat
my dory  the jolly mon  where is it
safe  at port royal  with the royal navy
that boat is my livelihood
you will get it back  or one better
how does he do that
anamaria trim the mainsail
aye aye sir
that is in your head boy
she  goes  free
you have got one shot  and we cannot die
enough of that  name your terms
elizabeth goes free
we got that part  anything else
you must swear by the holy bible
hah  ten years you carried that pistol and you end up wasting your shot
i know whose blood you need to end the curse
say the name or i slit your throat
the pearl  oh that is fine  and just how do you expect this to work
that is right
i will torture it out of you
blast you  i will throw you in prison
let's say i tell you the wrong person  what would you do
i will watch my back
you would best take a swim jack
so how did you get off that island anyway
you can go to your grave not knowing
no i really think i do
why do not i want to do this
you have no hope of surviving norringtongs attack  that is if you are mortal
the situation has changed
now you can take care of the dauntless right
there's  another exit
looks like your back to having nothing to offer
that is proper sir according to the code
no reason to fret  it is just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood
turner blood does not flow pure in his veins  best play it safe and spill it all
do you believe him
my apologies miss  as you were saying before you were so rudely interrupted
i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request  means 'no'
i will drop it
you have a name missy
you have got sand for a maid
thank you sir
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that  a family heirloom perhaps
maid or not it fits you
dare i ask the fate of it previous owner
oh there would be no sense in killing you miss turner
then why are not you eating
do you not know what this is then
it is a pirate medallion
the curse drove you to gather this
agreed  you have my word as a gentleman of fortune 
man overboard
boy overboard
did he speak
his name is will turner  that is all i found out
i cannot breathe
commodore i must protest  pirate or not this man saved my life
on his heels  gillette bring a squad down from the fort  elizabeth are you 
elizabeth i am relieved you are safe  clap him in irons  and behind his back this time
commodore you cannot do that
you are speaking up for him again
commodore i beg you  please do this  for me  as a wedding gift
i am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition i rescue mr turner
you may seclude yourself in my cabin  i am afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard
then i can wear mengs clothing
elizabeth is everything all right are you decent
it is  beautiful may i inquire as to the occasion
i knew it
difficult  to say
i am told that dress is the very latest fashion in london
elizabeth this is hardly appropriate 
i know the code
if an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete
you will be dining with the captain and he requests you wear this
i could never forget it miss swann
will how many times must i ask you to call me 'elizabeth'
i am glad we got here in time
why would my father send this to me
to keep it away from them  no pirate would sail to london for fear of execution dock
if i had known 
i cannot believe he would make such a sacrifice for us
there  and do not you dare tell me that was not a proper kiss
elizabeth i think it does not matter that we are of a different class 
it does not
miss swann
you are despicable
you are in league with barbossa
come on
has it changed since the last time you were here
captain sparrow  we have to get off this island  immediately
what  that is wrong  how will this help us get off the island
a month  will does not have a month  we have got to do something to help him
drink up me hearties yo ho 
what  what was that  something funny miss swann share please
nothing  it is nothing  just  i am reminded of a song i learned as a child  a song about pirates
that was before i met one of course
now i must hear this song  an authentic pirate song  have at it
well perhaps  with a bit more to drink i might 
jack it must be so terrible for you to be trapped here on this island all over again
ah well  the company is better than last time  and the scenery has definitely improved
mr sparrow  i am not sure i have had enough rum to allow that kind of talk
to freedom
what are you doing  you have burned our food the shade  the rum
you did not tell commodore norrington everything
nor did you i noticed
these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed
i have a plan  if it succeeds then any battle will be decidedly brief  and onesided
make it last then  now that is the nature of this venture of yours
a fool's errand
not if the fool has something barbossa wants  something he needs
kid's a bit of a stick is not he
we would best drop canvas sir
that is in your head to put you in such a fine mood
how did you get off the island
blast it i am already awake
it is a signal  if we resist it will not just be death  there will be torture as well
we are not going to just surrender
we can at least fight  we might be able to kill a few
raise the sails
the wind is quarter from astern  by the time we are underway we will never catch them
hands  come about  jackets off the cannons  we are to fire on our own ship
all the men in place sir  ready to fire
sir  shall i break out the cannons
dead serious
you understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men  you will never make it out of the bay
agreed  you have the momentary advantage sir  but i will see you smile from the yard arm sir
this dock is offlimits to civilians
some sort of todo up at the fort eh  you two were not invited
no  somone has to make sure this dock stays offlimits to civilians
well well jack sparrow is not it
we had time to get to know each other
you would do that
they left me stranded  twice what have you got to lose
nothing i would not be please to be rid of
that chart i drew up will get you past the reefs  if you are steersmangs good enough that is
you look familiar  have i ever threatened you before
do you think this is wise boy crossing blades with a pirate
you threatened miss swann
who makes all these
the ship's real enough  so its anchorage must be a real place where is it
why ask me
because you are a pirate
and you want to turn pirate yourself
i can get you out of here
not without my effects
we are going to steal a ship  that ship
commandeer  we are going to commandeer a ship  nautical term
this is either crazy or brilliant
everybody stay calm  we are taking over the ship
is that so
that is not true
i swear you look just like him
it is not true my father was a pirate
figured you would not want to hear it
my father did not think of my mother  his family  as a burden
sure  because he could always go pirating
put it away will  it is not worth getting beat again
you did not beat me  you ignored the rule of engagement  in a fair fight i would kill you
just do it quickly
shut up before you lose them all
miss swann  we are here to rescue you  it is going badly
go to the opposite end of the island and signal the ship  i will keep 'em busy
are you certain this is the right way
there's no *real* ship as can match the interceptor
the black pearl is a real ship
no it is not
yes it is  i have seen it
you have not seen it
that is your business in port royal 'mr smith'
i think he is telling the truth
he is not telling the truth
he may be
that jack sparrow  he talked about the black pearl
captain norrington i appreciate your fervor but i am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter
he is still breathing
what happened here
has my daughter given you an answer yet
no  she has not
well she had a very taxing day ghastly weather tonight
this is doyle's house
this is the baby sitter
oh when are they expected home
does he have your number mr jefferies
this could go off in a month  or an hour
i will pull somebody out of japan
name me a better photographer
but his leg
like disposing of their wives
of course it is normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope
mrs  thorwald's  clothes  clean  carefully packed  not too stylish  but presentable
i would say that is looked as if she was not coming back
you think i made all this up
i think you saw something  that probably has a very simple explanation
for instance
his wife took a trip
she  was  an  invalid
you told me  i have got to run jeff
we know the wife is gone i will see if i can find out where
by the way  what happened to your leg
i think they missed their chance with her
she never left the apartment 
then where is she  in the ice box
 until yesterday morning
what time
i think that is about the time i fell asleep
feel a little foolish
who said they left then
who left  where
a very convenient guy  this superintendent have you checked his bank deposits lately
doyle  are you interested in solving a case or making me look foolish
i cannot do it even if he is gone
by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment
a detective's nightmare
how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years
you know every day for three years i asked myself that same question
ever get an answer
forget the story  find the trunk mrs thorwald's in it
is  is anna  who i think it is
enough to scare me that you would not get here in time and we would lose him
you think he is getting out of here
he has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there
that was not mrs thorwald who left with him yesterday morning
did you ever own a saw
but i am not a killer
oh  that phone call  i gave them your number  hope you do not mind
that depends on who they were
this is doyle jeff
listen to me lisa's been arrested
i told you that 
i know what you told me she went in to get evidence and she came out with it
like what
like mrs thorwald's wedding ring if that woman were still alive she would be wearing it
where would they take lisa
precinct six i sent a friend over with bail money
just do not dally thorwald knows he is being watched he will not hang around long

swell i get myself halfkilled for you  and you reward me by stealing my assignments
i did not ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track
you asked for something dramatically different you got it
read some good books
i have been taking pictures so long i do not know how to read anymore
i will send you some comic books
listen  if you do not pull me out of this swamp of boredom  i will do something drastic
like what
i will  i will get married then i will never be able to go anywhere
yeah maybe in the high rent districts they discuss  but in my neighborhood they still nag
well  you know best call you later jeff
yeah is that you jeff
it is me

stella  in economics a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market absolutely none
right now i would even welcome trouble
you have got a hormone deficiency
how can you tell that from a thermometer
i knew it
do not you ever heat that stuff up
gives your circulation something to fight  what kind of trouble
lisa fremont
you must be kidding a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood
she expects me to marry her
that is normal
i do not want to
that is abnormal
it is happened before you know some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gung you might say
she is just not the girl for me
she is only perfect
too perfect too beautiful too talented too sophisticated too everything  but what i want
it is very simple she belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of park avenue expensive restaurants and literary cocktail parties
the only honest thing to do is call it off let her look for somebody else
i can just hear you now get out of here you perfect wonderful woman you are too good for me
there's an intelligent way to approach marriage
when i married myles we were both maladjusted misfits we still are and we have loved every minute of it
the insurance company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed not the wheelchair
how did you know
eyes bloodshot must have been staring out the window for hours
i was
what will you do if one of them catches you
keep your mind off her
she is real eat drink and be merry girl
and she will end up fat alcoholic and miserable
speaking of misery miss lonely hearts drank herself to sleep again alone
poor girl someday she will find her happiness
and some man will lose his
is not there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction
well the salesman could be available soon
he and his wife splitting up
it is hard to figure he went out several time last night in the rain carrying his sample case
is not he a salesman
now what could he sell at three in the morning
flashlights luminous dials for watches house numbers that light up
his personal effects he is probably running away  the coward
sometimes it is worse to stay than it is to run
what about this morning any developments
no the shades are still drawn in their apartment
a federal offense
you called the police
i am just going to get the name of their truck
mrs thorwald
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around
there's a dip at this end and since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks
thank heaven that is over
miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules
you can tell that from here
i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter
would four of them  
no  but it makes the rest easy to take and she is reading the bible
you know you might not be too bad a bargain for lisa after all
what are you two talking about
there's probably one in the basement
you know miss fremont  he might just have something there
that is she trying to do why does not she turn him in
smart girl
smart she will be arrested
when you took your first snapshot  did you ever think it would bring you to this
stella  how long do you think he will stay there
what do you need money for
one hundred and twentyseven
how much do you think you will need
ten here
thirtythree here totals oneninety not enough
what about the rest
jeff again  has tom come in yet
not yet jeff
you have not even heard from him
it is something really important jeff
i am afraid it is tess
who's thorwald
he knows  do not worry tess it is a man
goodnight you idiot
how is your leg
mmmm  hurts a little
and your stomach
empty as a football
and you love life
not too active
the lisa fremont who never wears the same dress twice
depends on the quote let's see  there's the plane tickets over import duties hidden taxes profit markups 
 a steal at eleven hundred dollars
that dress should be listed on the stock exchange
we sell a dozen a day in this price range
something big going on somewhere
going on right here it is a big night
it is opening night of the last depressing week of l b jefferies in a cast
now that is no way to spend your hard earned money
what would you think of starting off with dinner at the 21
big enough
yeah  i want to get this thing off and get moving
tell me  what was slim hayward wearing
you cannot buy that kind of publicity
that is good news
someday you might want to open up your own studio here
jeff  is not it time you came home you could pick your assignment
i wish there was one i wanted
make the one you want
for what
i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit
that is what is know as manless melancholia
miss lonely hearts at least that is something you will never have to worry about
well she picked the most prosperous looking one
she is not in love with him  or any of them
how can you tell that  from here
oh some songwriter in the studio apartment lives alone probably had an unhappy marriage
almost as if it were being written especially for us
did you ever eat fish heads and rice
oh i do that all the time whenever i have a few minutes after lunch
you do not think either one of us could ever change
there's nothing wrong with you lisa you have the town in the palm of your hand
not quite  it seems  goodbye jeff
you mean goodnight
cannot we just sort of keep things status quo
i am not exactly on the other side of the room
do not you ever have any problems
i have one now
so do i
he likes the way his wife welcomes him home
not that salesmangs wife and why did not he go to work today
homework it is more interesting
that is interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper
nothing thank heaven
why has not he gone into his wife's bedroom all day
i would not dare answer that
what do you think
jeff  if you could only see yourself
you would better before you catch the disease
what is it you are looking for
i want to find out that is wrong with the salesmangs wife does that make me sound like a madman
maybe she died
where is the doctor  the undertakers
lisa please
it is pretty hard to stay away from that word is not is
you could see all the things he did could not you
no comment
the name on the second floor rear mailbox reads mr and mrs lars that is lars lars thorwald
that is the apartment house number
okay chief that is my next assignment
to get on home
it does not seem to be in any hurry
that alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost 
someone not his wife
i wonder where he is going now
i do not know
suppose he does not come back again
well i guess it is safe to put on some lights now
all day long i have tried to keep my mind on work
thinking about thorwald
something on your mind lisa
it does not make sense to me
what does not
women are not that unpredictable
inside stuff
basic equipment you do not leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag
i am with you sweetie but detective thomas j doyle has a pat answer for that
that mrs thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband
still  those witnesses
do not be too hard on him he is a steady worker i wish he would get there though
we have all  what
night i am going to stay with you
i have the whole weekend off
say anything else and i will stay tomorrow night too
you said i would have to live out of one suitcase  i will bet yours is not this small
that is a suitcase
i will trade you  my feminine intuition for a bed for the night
from his landlord  once a month
it is utterly beautiful  i wish i could be creative
you are you have a talent for creating difficult situations
i do
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls and overpassionate daughters of the rich
the same
but he never ends up marrying her strange
weird  why do not i slip into something comfortable
you mean  like the kitchen and make us some coffee
i hate funny exit lines
whatever happened to that old saying love thy neighbor
did mr doyle think i stole this case
i will rephrase the question
do you like it
for a minute doyle almost had me convinced i was wrong
but you are not
do you think this was worth waiting all day to see
is he cleaning house
it is just a picture of the backyard that is all
something's in there those flowers have been taken up and put back again
was not that close
what for
get an ambulance  do not move try to lie still
lisa  i  i  cannot tell you how scared i was that you  you might

that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson i would forget it if i were you
i have been waiting for you miss gibson i want you to know i have decided to take your case
you think my sister is there
you cannot tell
can we go there now
i do not like this
which room is it
it is only a little way mr august
we cannot stand here all night
yes i understand
when i wanted to
mr ward will see you in just a few minutes will not you wait dr judd
i read your book the one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking
you are not a dipsomaniac at your age
i have come from jacqueline she needs money
if jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself
i am afraid she cannot do that ward it would endanger her
it is not just for myself i am asking her sister is here the kid's half crazy with anxiety
how much does she want
she could use a hundred dollars
i will give you a check
i have not got that much in cash
how much have you got
about fortyfive dollars
tell me how is jacqueline
but tell me 
she is nervous naturally under the circumstances
why mary 
hello frances
how is miss jacqueline
i do not know that is why i came to see mrs redi i am trying to find her
nothing's happened to her it is just that i cannot understand her not getting in touch with you
i cannot see much fun in teaching school why do not you go into the beauty business
is mrs redi nice to work for
redi's all right
she seems rather an odd woman to me
she is a pretty good sort
it always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy
the tip is anyhow i like to work on your hair
do you know what this is frances
i ought to know
what did she want
i did her hair
nothing that is absurd i heard you laughing and talking she was asking questions
she was just asking about you  whether it was nice to work for you or not
and that was all
no she asked about the trademark
what did she want to know
she showed me a drawing
we are not exactly strangers mary jacqueline spoke about you often i suppose she told you about me
noat the morgue they told me a mr gregory ward had made inquiries about jacqueline
the morgue no wonder you fainted  i wish you had come to me first
then you know where jacqueline is
thank you goodnight
this is about another murder  a woman at fifty second street
but you do believe me
i am sorry i did not intend to treat you like a child
but you have treated me that way
maybe the romaris might have a room they seem nice
what brought you down here greg
oh i had business with a man but i missed him 
 what have you done about irving august
oh i am making investigations
greg it is not a wild tale it is true if there were only some way 
please  i cannot explain things like this to your right ear
last night in this very restaurant mr jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear
who the devil is he
you could have told me any time you were jacqueline's husband
things changed mary the reasons for finding jacqueline changed i want to find jacqueline to settle things
i thought i might close up the apartment  maybe get a place in connecticut
good night jacqueline  good night mary
that was dr judd he was phoning to say that jacqueline is on her way here 
gregory   you would better take jacqueline with you tonight
i know  i should not have told you
i am going to find your sister
i do not think that is a good subject for jokes mr hoag
but i am not joking
you do not even know jacqueline gibson
but i understand her that may be more important
all very nice but what are you going to do  listen at every house in new york for jacqueline's voice
i am looking for a party  a merry party
do you think he knows about this
could you find him
that is that
let her know what
she will have to know some time
who are you
and you do not want to die i have always wanted to die  always
i am tired of being afraid  of waiting
why wait
i am not going to wait i am going out  laugh dance do all the things i used to do
and then
i do not know
please jacqueline
if you get lonely go down and see mrs romari i told her you were staying with me
wellthen i have spoiled your dinner  your food will not digest and your wine will sour
it is terribly sweet of you jason
i have been at the library
but you are always at the library
i went as a detective i found out that mrs redi reads the same books as dr judd
i am at sea jason
such a simple matter this figure is the symbol of the palladists
look i am serious it is a real and vary earnest society  a dangerous society
i want you to see my room i want you to see all of it
my window   through which i see the world
it is beautiful  that searchlight  the stars 
it is not a searchlight  it is a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince  not stars 
i have to go 
it is not that  you said have to go what could compel you 
do not make me tell you jason
i had begun to write again that is whet i was doing when you came in
it is because of jacqueline  i cannot go on looking for her 
you went to see mrs redi she told you something  what was it
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man
if it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find jacqueline
and gregory  he loves her
he loves you mary and you will have to tell him
i cannot find gregory i have been trying to find him
that is wrong mary
jacqueline mr romari phoned me she went out this afternoon with two men he would never seen before
what are you thinking of bella can i eat dry
we are happy mrs romari because you have everything  and i am happy because i have nothing to lose
and the other was judd
yes dr louis judd
would it be asking too much miss gottschalk for you to get me these books
why mr jason most of these books are on the closed shelf you have to get permission
i would not want to take them out i just want to look at them
where is jacqueline gibson
what a peculiar question
i saw you with her last week i knew you would be here tonight where is she
see that girl that is jacqueline's sister it is because of her i ask
what was she to you
i have lost my knack
well it will not work love and understanding will not make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet
actually i want to ask two favors of you  one as a poet 	one as a detective
and this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life
wait  there is that other favor
i would forgotten
tell me where jacqueline is  we have got to find her
you do not expect me to do that do you
yes when i tell you
tell me why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like byron and find yourself famous
i think it is time
i am afraid this is no time to play cyrano my friend what was in your mind
a book of successful verse might have changed that eh
if you like i will go with you to dinner
dr judd
it is my cloven hoof it trips me up sometimes
cloven hoof
yes you could become a country wife  fool around with petunias and pullets
would they hurt her
i know the others  redi fallon leo bruns but i would never have guessed it of you natalie
one believes  it is like any other religion
i would hardly describe it that way  the worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing
i have not said anything of the sort
but you would like to know where she is
yes there are certain punitive measures
i was a great dancer
it would be a charming experience she might only protest half as much
is it about jacqueline
this is incredible i it must be some sort of a joke
i am very very serious
but you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister
i did not know
leave me your address and if i find anything i will get in touch with you
i am stopping at the chatsworth
i am afraid not
this is mrs redi mary
i will be out in a minute
i can almost feel your doubt about what i am saying mary
once you would seen my sister you would never forget her
yes  yes if she made that much impression on you i am sure it was jacqueline
she is not been here for a long time
you mean she just came here rented the room locked it and left
your sister   have you heard from her lately
no mrs lowood she does not write often
that makes it all the more difficult 
difficult has anything happened to jacqueline
we do not know mary we have been unable to get in touch with your sister
i thought you might know her she was seen here about a week ago her name is jacqueline gibson
i do not know no gibson this is a restaurant many people come here
fo come ti pare to desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza
miss gibson i am tired of resting
is it fifteen minutes yet
but she told him frances she told him about us
it is a very real danger and one which forces our decision
i have taken care of mary i have spoken to her she is going back to school
i am sorry to be late natalie
sorry i am nervous this is very trying for me
i know you introduced jacqueline to us  but how could you tell 
you have only to stretch out your hand take up the glass and drink a little
oh you feel very good betts you have such a cosy body i am jealous i am so skinny
c'mon let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now your father will never miss it

you have to give me your word you will not come in  then i will come out
what happened to gibarian
did not you talk to snow
i am here to recover this mission report my findings and make a recommendation  now what happened to him
the same thing that could happen to any of us
where is his body
in the lab  with her probably
no  there's no behavior modification
that is fantastic
you killed her
she will come back
no she will not
you fucking bastard
it is changing characteristics  it is solidifying taking on weight
that is wrong  what happened to gibarian
i cannot talk just now  i am too tired
where is sartorius
in his lab  he will not let you in
he will let me in
is there anybody else here
why who did you see
gibarian warned me  he left me a message
who was it
tell me  i will not think you are insane
how much sleep do you need
how much sleep
how long can you go without sleep
that depends
was her breakfast conversation that bad
shut up
i told you try to stay calm  you are supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch
personally i think it is god  at least it fits my definition
it started about three months ago right after the government sold the expedition  we were ready to go home
i wish you would told me
what will you say
to who
what are you going to report back to earth
kelvin you awake
what is it
is it being deliberately cruel you mean  i do not think so
i am just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances
 we are not sure of that  we are not sure we are not all hallucinating
if god is beyond our comprehension and she    is here for reasons that cannot be understood is not god here
consciousness is enough that is all i have saying  consciousness should be enough for anybody
perhaps it did
they come when you sleep
what happened
she knows everything  she knows who she is
what do you want
i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan
what plan
just get him to stop
her oxygen would have run out
that is wrong with you  we need your help
but i cannot leave with you  i will not make it
i need to see snow
i will go with you
i do not know  i cannot be alone
what are they
to calm your anxiety
poem  dylan thomas  i thought of it when i saw you on the train
not a very happy poem
you did not look very happy
i was not
you want to fuck her
stop it
you behave as though you want to fuck her
let's go home
you go home
i am  please come with me  i do not want to do this here
you are better when you take them
i know i know  but still somehow i do not feel better
what do you remember
what do you mean
is it intelligent
intelligent beyond our comprehension
then it is god right
it is something
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang
as i said it is beyond our comprehension
what happened
you were trying to break down the door  do you know why
where have you been
what happened to us exactly
why did you say those things
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you
i think so
you sure say god a lot when we are doing it
he has a point
he does have a point  that is just not the way i would like to see it proven
do i really feel like i am
yes  yes
that is wrong
what are you talking about
i am sure there are worse people to talk to but i do not know who they are
but we fought
yes  especially toward the end
why did she do it
you she said i did not love her
was she right
no  i love you
can you sleep
i do not think do  it is not sleep it is something else  it is all around me
you are the coward
do not debate him he will say anything
but that is what happened before
do you want to stay here
do you
that is wrong
gibarian  he was here
you said he was dead
that is happening to us
how could it be so cruel  how could it torture us like this
listen i do not care about anything but the fact that you are here  you are her you are rheya
you are lying  i am not human
rheya i am not going back  i am staying here with you
then you will die

i i am rheya  but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago
yes  i told you  it was exactly like mine
is that really what you want
i want to stop taking those pills
i wish you would not
they do something to me  it is hard to think straight
i think they help
i have consciousness but i am not mortal  do not you see why i am going crazy
you have to remember that i love you that is all that matters 
am i really her
what are you taking

that is the general idea  only it is not so general as far as i am concerned
lieutenant dunbar it would not be james schuyler dunbar from boston

no bother i am very grateful for a little company you see i suffer from insomnia
you are being rude again
i want to sleep i have not slept for three days
oh come now you threw a time bomb
here we have a typical barrack it houses seventyfive men every one of them has his own bunk naturally
naturally it would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk
as for the blankets you will notice they are very warm fifty percent wool
what do you do for heat in this barrack no stove
the men here used it for a trap door so we had to remove it temporarily
well herr inspector how did you find the camp crowded but gemuetlich shall we say
i want to talk about lieutenant dunbar is this lieutenant dunbar
it is
and the way you search your prisoners it does sound rather unlikely
all i know is he did it i am satisfied
aufstehen gentlemen please you do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today
then droppen sie dead
why do not we accept animal the worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades

anything else
good evening sergeants  a bit dank in here is not it where is the barackenfuehrer
yes sir
a lieutenant james dunbar
wait a minute we have some rights here  why is this man being taken out
look  if you do not like the way i am handling this job 
do not worry we will take care of it
you are wasting your time duke  outside everybody let's get it over with
not yet
cut the horseplay harry that is the matter with you guys
it is not schulz it is that stoolie whoever he is he is sure batting a thousand
what are you going to do
i do not know what your scheme is but it sounds crazy
maybe it is crazy but it is better than having dunbar dead
what about schulz
we have all done a poor job of it
i still say this is my tag any objections hoffy
what do you say hoffy we will hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of barracks nine
you would better cut out in back of the south latrine
why the south latrine
los los dummkopf
lay off schulz he is got a sickness he is krank
we know we got them last year five minutes after the geneva man was gone the blankets were gone
one more thing gentlemen the kommandant told me to pick up the radio
you must get out for your own good you must get out
stay out of it sefton
anybody call
if i were you sefton i would eat that egg some place else like for instance under the barrack
if you cannot get the bbc how about getting guy lombardo
that is the big idea sefton take that telescope out of here
says who
says me
you take it out only you are going to have a riot on your hands
lay off sefton
with your mother's pull how come you are not a chicken colonel by now
that is the matter boys is my slip showing
what happened cookie who did it
we did it
you heard that sefton
so who stays with me maybe joey no  not joey would not you feel safer with security on the job
two packs of cigarettes say dunbar never gets out of the compound
you starting that again
look sefton i had my hands full so they would not tear you apart 
how do they know
you told them hoffy
who did
you did
you off your rocker
what are we going to do with him
you taking dunbar
you could use a new one yourself
pirelli coleman agnew shapiro
nothing for kuzawa
shapiro shapiro
now you have done it you have given me nervous indigestion  anything else bothering you boys
just one little thing how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson would not get out of the forest
and that is that crack supposed to mean
when the krauts find that gadget they will throw us all in the boob
so was the radio private property so was manfredi and johnson
yes i am from cleveland
three hundred and sixtyfifth bomb squadron out of chelveston
are you questioning me
just getting acquainted trying to make one friend in this barracks
ach so
what did you say
are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the germans find out where dunbar is
no i do not sprechen sie deutsch
maybe just one word kaput because you are kaput price
will you get this guy out of my hair so i can go
go where to the kommandant's office and tell him where dunbar is
december seventh fortyone
what time
six o'clock i was having dinner
the what
let us see we have now two empty bunks here  nummer einundsiebzig und nummer dreiundsiebzig in baracke vier
which one of us is the informer
schulz you are off your nut
give me the radio
we have no radio
nun was ist haben sie's herausgefunden
ich weiss alles
wie hat er's gemacht
good morning sefton
good morning schulz and how is mrs schulz and all the little schulzes
du lieber gott how do you look you had a fight
how would you like to give frau schulz a pair of silk stockings for christmas
you should go and see the doctor maybe i can   silk stockings
wunderbar maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife but there is a piano teacher in the village 
three hundred cigarettes what is it you want from me
who's the guy schulz
what guy
the one you work with who is he how do you do it
i do not want those cigarettes
i will make it five hundred
talk what i do not know anything
that is the matter with you you want to be killed
hey schulz  as long as you are going to move somebody in  how about a couple of those russian broads
just get us a couple with big glockenspiels
did i interrupt something gentlemen
yeah we were just passing out guns
this is me in cincinnati
who's the other wrestler the one with the mustache
that is my wife
look at all that meat is not she the bitter end
why do not we just plug up that tunnel  with the kommandant on one end and you on the other
we will put pink ribbons on the bedbugs
from a chicken bugwit
is it all right if we smell it
that would not be the cigarettes you took us for last night
you must have been some tail gunner  go ahead cookie
have a nice time over there
so you are stuck with me eh
you heard him
you are not disposing of those russian broads
all automates ready and functioning automatic moorings retracted all speeds available through transwarp drive
enterprise maintaining full impulse power
and we are gaining stand by tractor beam
tractor beam aye
steady steady boys keep scanning  i thought you people were reliable where the hell is he
he has been here for some time i can feel his presence
do not give me your klingon mumbo jumbo  there ai not another vessel in this whole damn quadrant
put me on the hailing frequency
that is going on when do we get paid off
mr chekov  
an energy reading from 'c deck  from inside mr spock's quarters
mr chekov i ordered spock's quarters sealed
shall i alert dr mccoy
unit two this is one the kobayashi maru has set sail for the promised land acknowledge
calm yourself bones
sir commander starfleet on emergency channel he orders you to surrender this vessel
excelsior closing to 4000 meters sir
you did great bones just great
admiral there is no response from the grissom on any channel
still no response sir
i would swear something was there sir but i might have imagined it
what did you see chekov
for an instant a scout class vessel
nothing on my scanner sir
aye sir coding now
do you wish to advise starfleet sir
surge from astern sir aft quarter
could it be spock's
it has to be gravitational fields were in flux it must have soft landed
i do not believe it
all right  get your gear i will put you down next time around
hello sir it is david
david what went wrong
sector two indicating desert terrain minimal vegetation temperature thirtynine point four
sector three subtropical vegetation temperature   temperature decreasing rapidly 
all the varieties of land and weather known to earth within a few hours walk
you must be very proud of what you and your mother have created
same sector metallic mass
underground deposit
negative on surface a manufactured object
approximately two meters long cylindrical in form
new orbit commencing coming up on sector three
short range scan
as before metallic mass verifying triminium photon tube no new data
check for trace radiation infrared enhancement
there ushould notu be any only plant forms were built into the genesis matrix
captain please  we will take the risk we have ugotu to find out what it is
saavik to grissom request computer study of soil samples for geological aging
i will handle that later
my readings indicate great instability
what is it
later let's go
saavik my god what happened to them
it would seem that grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack
you mean we are stranded down here
logic indicates that is the case
how can you be logical at a time like this we have to get thee hell off this planet
that may be difficult
why do not you just call for uhelpu
it is time for total truth between us  this planet is not what you intended or hoped for is it
i used protomatter in the genesis matrix
protomatter an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable
it was the only way to solve certain problems 
did your collaborator know
my mother knew nothing about it that is why i asked her to leave genesis in my hands
so like your father you changed the rules
this planet is aging in surges
 how long
days maybe hours protomatter has made the situation unpredictable  i am sorry
it will be hardest on spock soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood
i do not understand
pon farr vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life
whoever they are they are getting closer
i will go
if equipment is functioning properly indications are  an animal life form
captain the logical alternative is obvious beaming down to the surface is permitted
grissom to landing party we have you approaching radioactive indications do you concur
affirmative captain our readings are well below danger level
very well exercise caution lieutenant this landing is captaings discretion and i am the one who's out on a limb
captain this is saavik come in please
ah saavik that is ah extroadinary what would you ah like to do next
request permission to beam aboard immediately
saavik does dr marcus think there could be  any chance of  ah  radioactive contamination
none that i can detect sir
i am sure starfleet would approve sir
captain that is happening
eight weeks sir  but you do not have eight weeks so i will do it for ya in two
mr scott have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four
certainly sir how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker
mr scott
i would be grateful admiral if you would give the word
aye sir she is got her second wind now
mr scott all power to the weapons systems 
mr scott two photon torpedoes at the ready sight on the center of the mass
good shooting scotty
aye those two hits should stop a horse let alone a bird
i am all right  stand by to return fire mr scott transfer power to the phaser banks 
oh god sir i dinna think so
that is wrong
how many more
just him sir
admiral this is lieutenant saavik
saavik is david with you
yes he is and someone else vulcan scientist of your acquaintance
this vulcan  is he alive
what happened
is there uanythingu we can do
the genesis planet is gone
yes admiral but that may not be possible
what what are you saying
the katra ritual is meant to deposit spock's consciousness in the hall of ancient thought  not in his body
and if they do not what will happen to spock
my god
i know you do i not
yes and i know you
my father says you have been my friend you came back for me
you would have done the same for me
why would you do this
yes yes spock
the ship out of danger
on course admiral estimating spacedock in two point one hours
 admiral that is going to happen to enterprise
the word sir
the word is no  i am therefore going anyway
count on our help sir
 we have cleared spacedoors
warp speed mr sulu
excelsior the great experiment is adrift in space
estimating genesis 29 hours present speed
we are secured from warp speed now entering genesis sector of mutara quadrant
see that shimmering area
that distortion is closing rapidly opinion sulu
i think it is an energy form sir
yes enough energy to hide a ship would not you say
 a cloaking device
klingon bird of prey sir she is arming torpedoes
mr sulu what is the crew complement of a bird of prey
about a dozen officers and men
sir planet core readings unstable changing rapidly
what about surface life signs
close there 
if i read this right sir we have full power
we are clear and free to navigate
the planet vulcan in hailing distance sir
mr sulu you are on manual
uhura any response from starfleet on our project genesis inquiries
no sir no response
standby automatic approach system  advise approach control
would you look at that
gentlemen good evening
good evening commander everything ready
welcome aboard admiral
where is doctor mccoy
admiral i do not understand the enterprise 
jim the enterprise is twenty years old we think her day is over
but we had requested  we were hoping to take her back to genesis
genesis whatever for
why  a natural desire to help finish the work we began
that is out of the question no one is going to genesis
as surely as if it were my own  harry give me back the enterprise with scotty's help
no jim enterprise would never stand the pounding
then i will find a ship  i will hire a ship
out of the question the council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to genesis
yes i hear you  i just had to try
of course now take my suggestion enjoy your leave  and let all this tension blow away
you are right  thanks for the drink
i say again grissom this is enterprise admiral kirk calling captain esteban or lieutenant saavik come in
who is this how dare you 
there are two more prisoners admiral do you want them killed too  surrender your vessel
commander klingon vessel stand by to board this ship on my next signal
no tricks kirk you have one minute
maltz prisoners are at beam coordinates standby
but why
genesis i want it
beam the vulcan up  and we talk
give me what i want  and i will consider it
you fool  look around you this planet is destroying itself
yes exhilarating is not it
if we do not help each other we will all die here
ambassador i  i had no idea you were here  i think you know my crew
yes i was
then you must know that you should have come with him to vulcan
he would not have spoken of it openly
then how 
kirk i must have your thoughts may i join your mind
 the needs of the many outweigh
 the needs of the few
yes but  how
one alive one not yet both in pain
what you ask is difficult
what about spock
i am not sure only time will answer  kirk i thank you what you have done is 
what i have done i had to do
but at what cost your ship your son
so  speak
share this with no one
sir may i suggest 
i ordered no interruptions
we are cloaked enemy closing on impulse power range 5000 kellicams
perhaps they wish to take you prisoner
how can you tell that
i give two minutes for you and your gallant crew  take every last man form a boarding party armed heavily
i will be in my quarters execute course to the federation boundary
range 3000 kellicams
1000 kellicams closing
my lord enemy commander wishes a truce to confer
my lord what are your orders
i underestimated him he did the one thing i did not anticipate  he destroyed himself
sir may i 
killing his son was ustupidu it made kirk willing to die
we still have the prisoners sir perhaps their information 
they are useless it was kirk i needed and i let him slip away
you amaze me commander
commander these are some of the most famous people in starfleet admiral kirk my god
good for you lieutenant
but it is damn irregular no destination orders no encoded id
all true
well  what are we going to do about it
i am going to do nothing about it uyouu are going to sit in the closet
the uclosetu have you lost all sense of reality
fuzzy face is gone
do you know who i am
you are me
do you know where you are
brother i cannot move
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship
i do not understand
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship
no can i move now
no i must deactivate you
sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath is not it
please beverly this is hard enough
when was he created
about twentyfive years ago they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell
beverly come in
remember him
he was a bit proud as i recall
he was a damn fool selfish and ambitious very much in need of seasoning
jean luc whatever you were right now you are the man you have made yourself he is someone else
aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels you are completely normal
how long does he have
that was another time
not tonight i have work here
so to happy endings
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan
will and deanna joining the titan dr crusher going to starfleet medical
now you make a toast
to new worlds
the closest signature is two kilometers to the west that direction sir
the final signature is approx imately 300 meters up that incline
he is very observant
my mission was a success sir i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation
good work the download
a bit less florid data
a weapon
it will only work for one of us
yes sir
we will find a way off together recommendations
what do you imagine this is
can you open the shuttlebay doors
affirmative sir negative sir they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals
do you think this is a wise course of action
we are about to find out power up disruptors and fire on my mark
how long until we reach the fleet
for now we see but through a glass darkly he said he is a mirror
he would deny a human connection is possible he considers himself entirely reman
how can you be sure
we are passing through the bassen rift the projections will return when we have cleared it
it is interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography
yes sir the rift effects all longrange communications
we are losing dorsal shields
captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine
we are being hailed
why am i looking at me
you are not looking at your self you are looking at me
you have a red shirt
how many of you did dr soong make
but i believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions
do not give up hope data i know i know you are not capable of hope
we have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten
it appears to be   an arm
why is it moving
it is you
if you would not mind
really captain it was a lovely toast
the least i could do for you deanna  besides you know me im a talking head
may i have this dance
do you have a moment sir
as much as we care for him deanna we have to remember that data is not capable of disappointment
i am going to miss you
is he sincere about wanting peace
how could i not
captain do not assume he is anything like you are you should resist the urge to think you know him
how can you be certain
the one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle me
but how can he he will kill you
he can never know you as i know you he can never touch you as i touch you
this is not real
i will always be with you now now and forever
captain picard commander donatra of the warbird valdore might we be of assistance
your timing is impeccable commander
the empire considers this a matter of internal security we regret you have become involved
i am afraid that drink will have to wait captain
open a channel
this is commander donatra of the valdore we are dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies
it is very faint but i have isolated it to the third planet in the kolarin system
what do we know about the planet
i read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface
cannon fodder
i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical
which is why our initial scans did not pick it up but he is got it captain
that is he doing
aye sir
deanna on my mark
how long until he can fire
you have the bridge commander use all available power to move away from the scimitar  now mister la forge
sir we are being hailed
geordi prepare the shuttle bay for arrivals they do not know our procedures so just open the doors
i will take care of it sir
new praetor
just lucky admiral
enterprise we are the reman warbird scimitar
praetor shinzon i am pleased to
so human you have met your better self
that will never happen
it would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest
there will be another after me and another after that you will find we are a resilient species
i will not do it
wont do what mister worf
captain i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear  naked
i am picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system
to find the head sir
sir i recommend we raise shields
tactical analysis mister worf
we are being hailed
sir we have had an unauthorized access into the main computer
sir we are being hailed
coordinate our attack with the valdore's tactical officer triangulate fire on any shield impacts
captain the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock
that is this
diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone
captain i hope i do not have to remind you 
captain you have an alpha priority communication from starfleet command
we have to assume he had romulan collaborators
a coup d'etat
why do not they answer our hails
it is an old psychological strategy number one to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy
captain with all due respect to diplomatic protocols   the federation council's not sitting out here we are
she is not out for a pleasure cruise
not very chatty
he was not designed to live a complete human life span
oh boy destroy humanity and the federation is crippled
strength in numbers
counselor troi report to the bridge
the titangs a fine ship will and she is getting a captain worthy of her
but she is not the enterprise
when your first officer insists that you cannot go on away missions ignore him
serving with you has been an honor
i hope you will forgive the darkness we are not comfortable in the light
praetor shinzon were not here to discuss your lack of a social life
yes i am sorry captain  there's so much we have to talk about
and the senate supports you
we need to talk just you and i
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow just the two of us or just the one of us
you know i need to verify this
romulan ale  i am surprised i cannot stand it
it is not quite the face you remember
yes the eyes have it
our eyes reflect our lives do not they yours are so confident
you are doing this to liberate the remans
you do not trust me
there's so much and so much of it is dull
and you dreamed about what was up there about
after you praetor
so i am not as tall as you expected
i always hoped i would hit two meters
with a full head of hair
shinzon i am trying to believe you
in time jean luc
hello jean luc
why am i here
what are you doing
that is this all about
it is about destiny picard about a reman outcast who
i will not defend my life to you
it amazes me how little you know yourself
you cannot trace my holographic emitters captainn so do not bother and you cannot contact starfleet we are quite alone
you know that is not possible
long ago
not so long
childish dreams captain lost in the dilithium mines of remus i am what you see now
i do not know
its too late
you can still make a choice make the right one now
i hope you are still alive jean luc
praetor we have received the transponder signal
target disruptors destroy them
deploy the weapon kill everything on that ship then set a course for earth
what about picard
our greater goal is more important brother
well that sounds relaxing too
so theyve got him up and running
he is a very unusual android
my god
minimal damage to the scimitar
believe it or not i think the cavalry has arrived
intruder alert
are we prepared
this is a mistake
he is gentler than i thought and he has a sense of humor
do not forget our mission shinzon we should act now time is running out
the bond is broken
find her again
no  this is wasting time
it is accelerating you have no more time for games
how long
how long until we reach the rift
what is it focus on your job
join us commanders  now that is the disposition of the fleet
they will obey praetor
praetor you have the whole fleet at your disposal they supported the coup they will follow you
the scimitar will serve my needs
but surely
then i do not understand the reason for the delay
you do not have to understand
and bringing the enterprise here what possible purpose could that serve
i have a purpose
then perhaps you will enlight en us
commander suran the games are over in two days the federation will be crippled beyond repair does that satisfy you
for the moment
come on let's go i got to get back
okay cash  logical  here's everything i have on me what do you say  how about a rolex
i already got a real one  come on it will not be too bad  it is not personal
superconducting quantum interference device  squid  got it  there's gonna be a test
no problem
we have nothing to talk about lenny
lenny the loser  panhandler of stolen dreams
you are too goddamned paranoid
i made my choice lenny
he does not know that is going on leave him alone
the only time a whore should open her mouth is when she is giving head
fuck you
oh my god  i do not believe this is happening
believe it  now bring me the trodes baby  come on quick
you cannot just kill him
and then she said 'since we are going to be spending so much time together'
hey you going to watch or you going to do
i feel like you are turning me into a vcr
i do not feel anything  is it on
forget it is there
cut it out tran
i do not think that is a good idea lenny
faith call me okay
hi baby  i have missed you
i know  lenny if tran finds you talking to me he will hurt you
you have to go  i mean it
yeah ok whatever you say  just answer one question  is anything wrong  iris said you might be in trouble
i know you faith  you are afraid of something  that is going on
he has his uses too
damn right
you are crazier than i thought lenny  coming here trangs just in there
i have a gun  it is under my bed
you do not know what you are fucking with here
that is going on
faith we know about jeriko  iris made me a copy of the tape
how did it happen  what was iris doing riding around with jeriko wearing a wire
we should talk alone
yeah he figured out what to do all right
you think tran killed her
the killer knew right where she was because he put her there
i understand  no i am not
you understand  attorney  right am i right
what kind of things exactly
talk to me about costs here
listen before we get into numbers i want you to try a taste  i got a deck with me
what  right here
yeah i am interested but can we get someplace a little less public
you see the look on that preppy puke's face  fucking pissed in his topsiders
thanks max
d'you always have to dress like a fucking pimp
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe
that is not saying much
i just hate to see you pining away it makes me want to vomit frankly  broken hearts are for assholes
see if you packed your piece you could have made the guy see sense
i am telling ya it is over  we used it all up
shoulda told me about your new gig buddy
i was gonna tell ya  hey it is just a job  i feel like shit about it
you alright  y'okay
yeah  no not really
let's work it
not now i do not want to think about it
come on lenny  you used to be good at this stuff  play it down that is the perp doing
he stalks her  he rapes her  then he does her
and he records it  thrill kill wants to see it again  and again
he records himself raping and killing her
so have i  too much
but this is a bad one
that is right  he wants to share needs an audience  this is one sick puppy
hey the last day of the world and you spend it in bed
looks like she was holding out
yup  hey so i heard you dropped in on tran last night  another slick lenny move
he is in this somehow i do not know how  just stay close to faith

you are not a client anymore tran i would not sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls
i always do

excuse me  what part of no do not you understand
mace you are my friend  i need you plus i will give you 25% of what i make tonight
mace  you are a lifesaver
so that is up with you  another busy night selling porno to wireheads

i know you would not be saying all this if you did not care about me thanks mace  really
look i gotta get some sleep
yeah  i do not see a way out of it
macey i know you are tired but can you drop me at the retinal fetish it is on your way
who's the new side of beef in trangs posse
guy named wade beemer  used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97
forget her
she still loves me
she thinks you are a bucket of dog vomit  trust me on this
i have crawled through the gutter through every wrinkle in the human brain
what i am saying  but you still come out this goofball romantic
that is that  present from faith
what is it
my god lenny  what is it
black  jack
and gives it to you
jesus mace  back off
uh unh  no way  they would crucify me
is this great fabric or what
you ever wonder why you get beat up a lot
he knows what he is doing  he is worn before a lot
so that gives you something
do not crank the gain any more you are gonna fry yourself
no more lenny
but that does not add does it
no it does not
so the guy's not a sicko
because it had to look random  not connected to anything or anyone  but then why give the rape to me
that is where it gets a little strange
and what about the guy that was following me
how is zander
whatup lenny
where we going
what is it
will you relax  there's nobody back there
mace the guy had a knife  to my throat  in my living room relaxing might be right out okay
you better keep a low profile for a while
think back about what she said exactly what she said
she wanted to go out to my car something about my car
lenny give them the tape
take it easy  the glass is bullet resistant
bullet resistant  whatever happened to bullet proof
goddamnit  911 is busy
this is bad
are you out of your fucking mind
those two guys were cops
you sure
tell me
i cannot tell you  you have got to see
hang on  hang on max  you see
i see  i see the earth opening up and swallowing us all
we got to make another copy of this little life insurance
you know what this tape could do if it gets out
i have got a good idea yeah
people finding out seeing that the lapd just flat out executed jeriko one  jesus  maybe they ought to see
well look at the plus side
there's a plus side
yeah  you gave up your hot tub tape to save me  that is real progress for you
it was a tough call
i still cannot square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops
he is totally cut off from the outer world
the only card we have to play is the tape  you know we get it to the media somehow
kinda guy you can count on in a pinch
okay we gotta get over there  can you borrow a dress from cecile or something
i am not going
yeah  lenny  i have
it did not stop you from loving them right  or understanding them or being able to forgive them
i guess
and it did not stop you from wanting to protect them  did it
mace you are a girl
got your ticket
you see tran
alright  we are going up
and do what  take on his whole posse
that is the original  there are no copies
take it to him
a cop  you want me to trust a cop

i do not follow
just an earthquake dylan  every once in a while we get a few
one of mom's cups got broken
dylan it is breakfast  not arts and crafts  what
you get any sleep last night
anything other than the obvious bothering you
five earthquakes in three weeks is enough
no you do not
what if it is not over
just be careful okay
i should survive two days in palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial do not you think

ms langenkamp  i am afraid there are no evening visiting hours in intensive care
is he all right
dylan  he is holding well  earlier he had some problems he is in an oxygen tent just now
if these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist what did you say you cut yourself on
it was an earthquake and it was dark  i have no idea
these look quite fresh
do you mind
i want my kid out of here now
very well as soon as we gather the appropriate papers
no way he is going anywhere  he is been well sedated
you going away

in what a romantic comedy
must have read about the funeral  sick mother  that is the last thing you need right now i am sure
darker  moreevil
yeahhow would you know
you are not crazy by the way
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy  and jumping in

it can be captured sometimes
if freddy's loose i mean in your script where is he going to go  another age  another form

me  why me
dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense  you played nancy after all the first to humiliate and defeat him
dylan  and  chase  my god wes did you know
heather it is just a movie a dream really
choice  what kind of choice
now that you have a child is it possible you have decided horror is bad for children

this dust is getting clogged in the intakes again
so does anybody have any suggestions
we could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship  that would kill it
might even incinerate the damn thing
it is clear
it looks completely different from the first one  it is more like a worm with legs and tentacles
so it is trapped in between  now we have to drive it out
hey are you guys still there that is going on
there's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge  i will go get it
no i do not want us separated
where did it come from
uhe isu the only one that knows that
blood's thoroughly oxygenated
god that smoke's poisonous
i never saw anything like that in my life except molecular acid
but this thing uses it for ubloodu
it makes me sick to see him like that
it is a crude symbolic language  looks primitive
we cannot go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose
it is over hunter
boy that is terrific
that thing god almighty did not you try to get it off him
hey now what is this
there  should be coming through about there
i will do it  the rest of you continue
how could anything be indigenous to this asteroid  it is dead
now we are in for it
no do not open the door  we do not want it escaping
well what the hell good can we do in here  we cannot grab it  it might jump on us 
how is broussard
he is running a fever
can you do anything for him
do not worry it will not damage it it will just give it a little incentive
we cannot pump poison gas down into the cooling unit  it will flood the whole ship
while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net
sounds like a rough one
we would better seal off the lower maintenance level at least trap it there 
we have got six hours left
oh my god
oh no  we cannot fight this thing there's only six hours of air left  we are dead men
if we could just get the ucreatureu into the lifeboat we could launch it into space and blow it up
good  that is good
you cannot say that i think it is a good plan
the flamethrower needs more fuel
the ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back
should we go outside and bring him in
it will be
it must have stopped moving  i am not getting anything
the flamethrower
now that is wrong
i have completely lost their signal
can you get them back
what  what was that
what do you mean no
we are not going anywhere
why you chickenshit bastard 
i have got 'em  they are back on my screens
how many
oh no
i keep my mouth pretty much shut but i do not like hitting
look at that
what is it  i cannot tell anything 
it is some kind of organ  it is inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat
i think that is how it is getting oxygen to him
that is happening up here
this is horrible
what common objects
you mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him
do not count on it
well i suppose that starshaped thing could be the parasite that got on broussard  is that what you mean
 and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle
blow the ship up
i think it is going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat
we can use the flamethrower
is not bait the word you used
just keep your finger off the button till she is way away from the ship that is all
is it armed
if you press the button right now it will blow the whole nose of the ship off
sandy you want to give us some vision
first contact
sandy can you home in on that beam
that is the frequency
i have got it  it is coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds declination 39 degrees 2 seconds
well we cannot go anywhere in this darkness  how long till dawn
just settle down  sandy you get any response yet
that way
that is wrong
it is close real close
how far
air lock
does not seem much doubt about it does there
this looks ancient
what would he say
if we do not hear from him soon i think we better go in after him
but what can we do  he is out of radio contact
there it caught
is it still coming up or is it hooked on something
no it is coming
uwhat is itu
oh god oh god no
it will not come  it is stuck
what is it
it is not coming off  not without his whole face coming off too
it is stopped
yes thank heaven
we are just plain lucky  that could have gone right through the hull  taken uweeksu to patch it
no thank god just missed him
is it still dripping
too primitive  it is a pre technological construction  that slab was engineered by an ironage culture at best
we are going home  we are in hyperspace
i am going to write a book about this expedition  i am going to call it the snark log
the commander normally has first publication rights
and what do we do when we find it
we came out there we will go back  a long time by the clock but a short time to us
we are the new pioneers chaz  we even have our own special diseases
i have got hunter and something else as well in front of him
are they close
they are on the next level up
my god it is stormy for a piece of rock that size
it appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort it blocks the xrays
that tube must be depositing it in him
first thing i am going to do when we get back is eat some biological food
that is the matter you do not like this stuff
all right tycoons let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand
where are we
chaz i have got something here on my security alert  a high priority from the computer
let's hear it
oh my god
it is out of focus
atmospheric turbulence  dust storm
what the hell happened
yeah okay 
10% argon 85% nitrogen 5% neon and some trace elements
nontoxic but unbreathable pressure
ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter
good  moisture content
zero  dry as a bone
any microorganisms
not a one  it is dead
anything else
okay chaz i hear you  i have got you on my board
martin uh we have found it
found what
find anything we missed
i do not even know what i am looking for
still worried
oh well you know me
this ship is full of cat hair
hey can you guys hear me
yeah we hear you  we are coming back
thank christ  we lost you  listen there's been a new development 
here chaz
we are coming up now open the outer lock door
chaz  what happened to broussard
you hear me martin  open the outer door
chaz if it is an organism and we let it in the ship will be infected
what film
look at these suckers  no wonder we could not get it off him
i cannot lean on faust any harder  he is been working nonstop on the engines
take us up
we made it  damn we made it
you bet we made it  martin set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive
that is the part that always makes me feel like i am gonna puke  when we accelerate into light speed
we will have to go into quarantine maybe for quite a while
we will not need it then
all right so that is what we have got a week  it is plenty of time
we have got it up here  it is trapped get up here fast
where are you
foodstorage room
that is it doing having a seizure
it started crashing around right after we locked it in
now what
this stuff's deadly  i hope we know what we are doing
now what
are you ucrazyu
so the only question left is who gets to crawl down the airshaft
that is a flipflop gate to channel the air but we can use it to trap the thing
how did it get so ubigu
two down four to go
can you make out any pattern in all that
well yes there's a pattern but it is meaningless to me
that next thing there  six legs tentacles  that is the thing we saw in the food locker
which presumably means
i saw it  faust got himself jammed in the air lock door  his body held it open
let's hear it
okay  first we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines
yeah i forgot
uhey watch itu
yes and maybe launch the boat and blow it too if the others are injured
all right martin we will be in touch with you on the communicator
and you will let me know when you have got it coming this way
kill me
that was melkonis it ate hunter
i will get you out of there
no do not
but i can save you  get you to the autodoc
no good it is eaten too much of me
what can i do
what the hell were you doing rewriting my story
i sure could not hurt it could i
it was fine the way it was
it was bullshit the way it was
i have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from virginia
you only got the job because both you and bradlee went to yale
bradlee went to harvard
they are all the same all those ivy league placesthey teach you about striped ties and suddenly you are smart
i am smart enough to know my story was solid
mine's better
no way
what is it about my writing that is so rotten
it is ok i am sorry i called you a failure
forget it the main thing  did you call me a failure
all right what do we know
let me lay a little theory on you
i am not interested in theory what do we know for example hunt's disappeared
what do you think
hunt does not seem like your ordinary consultant
maybe a political operative of some sort
a spy you mean
july of '71
that was fun  what now
i met a presidential aide once at a social occasion
that is that
i am trying
fifteen phone calls
fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in miami to gordon liddy at creep
why did not we get that
christ and i even know somebody at the phone company
she was panicked carlevery time i mentioned watergate you could tell
who's first
i do not get it this really was my turf
this is terrific work if you like rejection
i never scared anyone before
it is not us they were scared before we got there  what do we know
facts or theory
anything you have got
we never reveal our sources which is why you can talk to us
we understand your problem
you believe in the president you would not ever want to do anything disloyal
i hate both parties
did he just say what i think he said
i  could not believe what she told me eight cups of coffee worth
then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit
it goes very highwe have got to find out where
we will
she was really paranoid the bookkeeper
how do you want to handle sloan
you mean who's going to play the mean mp and who's going to be the nice one  whichever
he is another ivy leaguer so he will probably expect you to be understandingmight surprise him if you are not
you want me to be the bastard
the la times has a huge interview with baldwin
the lookout in the motor inn  he say anything we do not know
we gotta top the times
i know i know
if we could name the guys got the reports we would be ahead again
shit who do we know
i know a lawyer at justice
has he got an ax
almost every source we have used has been republican this guy's a card carrying democrat
i want you to shut up and listen to me
california illinois florida new hampshireall the major democratic primary states  why does everything you play sound the same
what would you have done
you think this was clawsengs initiation
he will give us a sworn statement
that cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the democratsfive guys had control
mitchell stans magruder kalmbach
nah  maybe
what if i went up and introduced myselfthink he would slug me
well we are trying to ruin his life
it is nothing personal though 
that is the matter
same as magruder i do not like it when they turn out to be human
i wish we were investigating attila the hun
sloan told the grand juryhe answered everything they asked him that means there's a record somewhere
how many fucking sources they think we got
deep throat will not confirmi never thought he was scared of anyone but he is scared of haldeman
i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury 
what does it say
sir i would like to ask you a few
listen i have got a dinnercannot we do this tomorrow
i will never get out of here in time
the telephone calls we know about that
the rest is barker's bank records it is mostly the eightynine thousand in mexican cashier's checks
i never could figure just who this dahlberg was  think it might be anything
sorry  now if it was hunt you were interested in
howard hunt
sure him i liked he was a very nice person secretive too traveled all over but a decent man
any idea what he did
oh the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating kennedy
hi it is me i am still here
i am so glad
i would really like to see mr dardis
and you will  but not now
i called him from washington he is the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning
could you reach mr dardis by car radio
mr dardis does call in every so often
well of course
donald segretti
you cannot
according to what we have been able to verify you have been busy
i have got a lot of energy
listenwe know you are involved in thiswe are going to get the story why not help
they never told me anything except my own rolei had to find out the rest in the papers
i know where dwight works
do you feel much about the things you did
i did not do anything wrong
tell that to muskie
sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe  off the record
you wrote the canuck letterthe one where you claimed muskie slurred the canadians
i did not
none of it was my idea carli did not go looking for the job
chapin did contact you then
sureoff the record
i am the one sent you to toronto bernstein
and we got a guy in justice
that is a real denial
it would have been nice to have had this i sure would have liked to have had this
where are your bills carl
five hundred six maybe
you are two months behindyou got enough to cover
i think
give me your checkbook then
i thought you had to get to miami
there's always a later plane
this is practically a high school reunion for us janei would have sprung for a classier place
anyplace really public they would know about itthey know everything at the committee carl
if you do not like it down there why do not you quit
i do not know what they would do to me
hey easy
you have really got to go
one minute but then
no never in so many words
there are too many people watching methey know i know a lot
could buy a lot of steaks 350000 dollars
i cannot be positive that it was used for the breakin but people sure are worried
which people
the ones who could disburse the money
who were they
there were a group of themi think five i do not know their names
why could not you have just dialed me from the office irwin
'cause i am not calling out from the phone company anymore  i think the place is bugged
so tell me about the times article
what do you want to know
something maybe big
and that makes anything you do ok is that it
just tell me about the goddamn article
it was accurate but i cannot get a fuller listing for youall barker's phone records have been subpoenaed
who by
a miami da the guy doing the investigating is named martin dardis 
then again maybe things are even worse than we have written
do you think the truth will come out at the trial
that is another of the things i am not so sure of
because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors
we were never told flat out do not talk but the message was clear
to cover up
but they both worked at the white house
i will not talk about the other two
i really cannot talk now
i am not your source on that
that leaves haldeman period
if we wrote a story that said haldeman controlled the fund
then it is our asses is not it
i do not know i do not know it feels thin
that is this
i was told by this guy at the white house that hunt was investigating teddy kennedy
how senior
just tell me his title
i do not know titles
this is a daily paper we will explain it tomorrow  you are certain on mitchell
i got clawsen on hold
his dialing finger must be falling off
what do you think
i am sure
we cannot talk inside either
mr rafferty was very helpful four cubanamericans and this other man james mccord
look i told you inside
what i do not understand is how you got here
did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break in called you
there is no reason to assume other people were involved
they are not my clients
you are a lawyer and you are here
i met one of the defendants mr barker at a social occasion once  i have nothing more to say
it was really nice of you to come since you would only met him once
are you implying you do not believe me
i have nothing more to say
you claiming it was all a misunderstanding ken
absolutelymarilyngs gotten it totally wrong
she is an awfully good reporteri cannot remember her getting too much wrong before can you
that is a bullshit question that is a question straight out of wichita kansas
sorry ken listen one last thing where did your talk with berger happen
where  what do you mean where
well was it in a bar her apartment some restaurant
you are definitely doing a story
that twentyfive thousand dollars is money i collected for nixon in this year's campaign
i saw the flag signalthat is up
if you do not like them why will not you be more concrete with me
follow the money always follow the money
to where
you changed cabs you are sure no one followed you
that is the whole thing aboutdo you know
what i know you will have to find out on your own
yes the little ratfuckers are now running our government
whobe specific how high up
you will have to find that out will not you
i hope you noticed how coolly i behaved under the threat of discovery
do justice and the fbi know what we know and why the hell have not they done anything about it
they know but they focused on the burglaryif it did not deal with the breakin they did not pursue it
why did not theywho told them not to
someone with authority i would imagine would not you  do not you know what you are onto come on
haldeman too
talk about segretti
do not concentrate on segretti or you will miss the overall scheme too
there were more then
follow every leadevery lead goes somewhere
the canuck letterwas that a white house operation
do not you miss the grand scheme too
fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats
we know thatand if we were wrong we are resigningwere we wrong
howard hunt here
hi i am bob woodward of the post and
your name please
james mccord
and what is your occupation mr mccord
government recently retired
where in government
i am so glad you could come mr
i think so
when will you be do you think when are we going to know it all
it may never come out
never please do not tell me never  ben says you have found some wonderful sources
some justice department lawyers and an fbi man and some people from the committee to reelect yes ma'am
and the underground garage one  would i know him
i could not say
but it is possible
i would if you really ever wanted to know
we are going to need lots of good luck are not we
you are ignoring the importance of the dahlberg repercussions
nobody gives a shit about the dahlberg repercussions
well i have got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around would not you say so
absolutelyand that is all they do sit sit sitevery once in a while they call up a senator some reporting
preliminary hearing at superior courthouse
go on go on
ok get on this whouse guy and do a better job then you did on mccord
what would you get on whouse
lotsa hints
who's colson harry
who you got
woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the breakin thingabsolute page one stuff
in other words you got nothing you are thumbsucking
could develop
remember toronto harry
that was awhile ago
has any of them got an ax
listen we did not make them do these thingsonce they did it is our job to report it
harry were not you just arguing the opposite way
more denunciations
you think she wants us to ease up on the story
which young
and he says chapin hired segretti
well and good but when will he say it on the record
mr sloan
the report on the cash in maurice stans' safe the three hundred fifty thousand that is true
no it was closer to seven hundred thousand
and as treasurer you could release those funds
when so ordered
colsongs too smart to get directly involved with something like that
haldeman  right
i cannot say anything i am sorry 
a boy or a girl
and it was not ehrlichman or colson or the president
look when the watergate grand jury questioned you did you name names
hi i am bob woodward of the washington post and i hate to bother you at home
i already get the post i do not need another subscription
no i am a reporter i wanted to talk to you about the committee to re elect
the what to what

how long have you been up north
six months
you should know something
have you talked to eric
i have not but i very much want to  what do you know about the trouble in devil's cauldron
what happened here
the radio's on the fritz
where would you say eric is
somewhere along the pipeline
what about that hotheaded marshal sam wilder  i heard he was in the middle of this mess
sam  we have not seen him
he is coming around fine
what are you doing
stay here
great idea  pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a highpowered hunting rifle
i call it 'the turtle' as in carrying your home on your back
best thing is meyerling has to chase around to find us
i will go into town with you
eric leave it alone  it is not your business
did you catch corbett
sure did  he was one of the trappers we rousted from the haul road
was there any trouble
he was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker
oh sweetheart  it is beautiful
you make it sound like a prison sentence
that is not what i meant
winter  two straight months of night  we may never get out of bed  which would suit me fine
prolonged darkness makes people crazy
hightech in the wilderness gets me excited too
let's go
maybe you should drive him into devil's cauldron let them decide what to do with him
be careful okay
oh christ sweetheart  four days  i thought you were dead or worse
you cannot stay here  go back to the turtle  i will meet you back there in a few hours
that is going on
i will tell you everything later
where is corbett
here  a transport plane is due at eleven  once i put him on it it is all over
please anne marie you being here only complicates things
you are hurt
technology in the wilderness only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip
when you ran off i thought you would keep going until you were back home in washington
leave it here
let's keep going  we are only an hour from devil's cauldron
had no choice  given the situation
go ahead  take the jeep  i will come to cache with bob when he gets here
okay by me  you are the one likes these hot springs so much
you got two counts against you  trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land
cannot be much of a crime if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid
ben corbett
yep  afraid you have me at a disadvantage
kenai at the general store asked me to bring these  did not expect we would already met
new to the country kid
six months  ecological study for northland oil
nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window  see you again maybe
a lot to ask dragging him away from such a goodlooking girl 
does he have people
a daughter in oregon
how the hell were they smart enough to find us
been driving long
i needed a pilot's license to take the job here so i got one in six weeks
stay put
next time you want to kill yourself do not include me
i took the odds on getting down in one piece and i made it  now we are in my territory
i am not gonna carry you out of here
that is right  you are not
why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in
we will stop here dig out a snow shelter
we get wet we freeze to death in a couple hours
be my guest
it was not my idea to crash the plane
let's camp  there's grayling under this ice i will snare some for dinner
we have got another two hours of daylight
have to backtrack find another way down
forget it  it would take days
it could blow over tomorrow too
where in hell meyerling dig you up
you know meyerling
sure love to know where you fit in up here
there's a cabin maybe twenty miles south of here
have to get these wet things off
stay awake  you want to go hypothermic
told you i am fine
how many do you see
what  fuck off  save yourself
you do not feel cold
stay still
where is my elt
emergency transmitter  all your gear is back at wilder's
you got one
it was blown up with the plane
i am hungry  go kill me some dinner
an appetite  maybe you will not die after all
killing wildlife not good enough anymore so you go on to bigger and better things
do not judge me  you are a joke coming here from a fuckedup culture telling us what to do
do not push me
they think you are in fairbanks if not they still will not find you before the plane comes tomorrow
do not bet on it
i already have
talk to that goodlooking girl of yours
you broke the radio remember
maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend
answer and i will shoot
can you walk
wound's a throughandthrough missed my liver i think
how come you did not let him shoot me
like i said i would still be up on that mountain frozen solid it was not for you
hullo sam  slow day
benboys  yeah real slow and i would like to keep it that way
relax  one more day without drink will not kill you  right sam
i am living proof of that sad fact
can we buy the marshal some dinner
you would not shoot anyone
i got it from here  thanks
i will get loose before that plane comes
goddammit i do not need this aggravation  i will shoot you ben  bank on it
i do not want to hurt you sam
i am not too old to knock the snot out of you
i need to rent a cabin
that is the problem with sam wilder's place
 here's a hundred dollars  and if you or anyone else will back me up on this 
 forget it  and try not to bleed on my throw rugs  why do this
you do not mind me saying mr desmond you look like hell
have you heard anything from the girl staying with me anne marie
not a damn thing  that is going on  mr meyerling was here all steamed up looking for you
look neff i have got ben corbett with me 
 here  where is wilder
if corbett's men find out 
 i am putting him on the plane to fairbanks eleven tomorrow
that is wrong
i was just on my way to your ladyfriend's but i guess she found you
look mr desmond i did not count on it turning this ugly
what are you talking about
bastards killed sam you think they will not kill the rest of us
neff you know better than this
alleged killer
fuck you
bet you are right  but i did not come by to wangle a meal 
what would you say they call these spaceships
hey sam look over there  black and white smoke
damn  likely that is an sos have to pass on that lunch

exactly two hundred dollars a pop
you wanted to be partners with me

long term psychic or physiological repercussions
no do not be an ass
can i be anyone i want
two hundred dollars please
boy this is a toughie to be honest i did not anticipate this
and as i said sir we cannot very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel malkovich
right lester i heard you the first time i am not a dummy
have a seat i wracking my brain over this malkovich thing
we saw his show at the luxor last night
vegas what would you think
the kid's got talent you have never seen malkovich like this schwartz had him up there singing and dancing impressions
impressions those are hard
a scary dream
no a sexy dream of course a scary dream
what kind of circumstances
maxine says she will leave him if he leaves malkovich plus he is been challenged to a puppetduel by mantini
the great mantini
no the mediocre mantini of course the great mantini
oh he is good great actually i saw him do tru with his sixty foot robert morse puppet sensational
but i think i have another plan
do tell i love a good plan
can you do that i mean do you know anything about puppetry
i am the devil lester i think i can handle it
i was just asking no disrespect intended
fine i am not mad let's just drop it
floris get guinness on the phone
gehginnis ondah foam

yes of course dr lester
oh be still my heart
i am getting divorced
no you must not my child
i blew it dr lester
you followed your heart my child and that is not necessarily a bad thing
but now we have lost access to craig
you know i think it pays to leave juicemaking to the trained professionals you look terrible my dear
craig stole maxine from me dr lester
hmmm a lesbian are you i must inform you that i find that highly arousing
no i did not know that
aaaahhhh the portal
no do not harm the vessel
thank you all for your efforts but i am afraid we can no longer get into malkovich through the portal
why not i need to get in there
i am not certain my dear but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route
that bastard i will gladly dispose of him in the name of the order son of malkovich
yes hello i wanted to place an ad  hi are you craig's wife
do not stand in the way of my actualization as a man craig
and the funny thing is mr malkovich my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me

jm inc be all that someone else can be
i have to see you
we have to meet
but maxine i thought it was me you loved
hello schwartz i saw your show

like right now there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us  fingers rotting off
maybe  but there's an invisible wall a fabric that kinda keeps things separate
lucky thing

the dead get out
or the living fall in  who knows

ah ha  there you are sam

jill layton   you are a very good little girl what are you doing here
i am waiting for my daddy
in fact killing people 
and the cost of it all deputy minister seven percent of the gross national produce 
but the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year 
thank you very much deputy minister
thanks very much sam
if i can help you 
mr helpmann i have changed my mind i would like to accept the transfer  am i too late
too late that is for me to say
sam what are we going to do with you can you hear me sam
where is jill what have you done to her where is she
gillian layton
yes you have got to get me out of here i have got to find her
this is all a mistake do not you understand
yes well from the department's point of view you are certainly a bit of an own goal but 
please i have got to find jill
yes it is all a bit confusing but it seems she was killed resisting arrest
that is the matter
sorry nothing  see you  i am going to be late
you are late
hello jack
winking at sam she does not like me telling anyone but she is pleased as anything really
er i knew you looked different
remember how they used to stick out
dr jaffe has pinned her ears back
quite absolutely  i always thought they were false
sam what a surprise
sorry about that  mr helpmann told me you were coming aboard  congratulations
thanks are you officer 412l
for my sins are you settling in alright
i have got numbers all over these  i am not sure which is the one you want
layton oh shit
how do you mean
how much do you know
not much
enough though eh
b58732 that is a buttle is not it
christ you do know it all
what has tuttle done
we suspect him of freelance subversion
that is she done
you did not know as much about this business as you pretended to did you
er  no
very smart
er  but i would have found out anyway
yes i am impressed
but surely i mean perhaps she just happened to live above the buttles and 
look after that suit eh barbara chose it for me
right er you are not going to keep calling her barbara are you
barbara's a perfectly good name is not it
why hell not for any reason 
baffled i do not follow you
out of kindness
kindness that is the purpose behind this line of enquiry
so what are you going to do about her
get her out of circulation  i have put her on the detention list
you mean you are going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department
well i  good point what do you suggest
let me try to get to her i will deactivate her
what does that mean i do not want to be involved in anything unsavoury
trust me you do trust me do not you
of course we went to school together you are my oldest friend
and you are mine
you are the only person i can trust
then we would better keep this business just between the two of us
right just between as and the security forces
they were not at school with us
but i have already put her on the search and detain list
take her off the list
there's no procedure for that until she is been arrested
say it was a mistake
thanks jack i will be in touch
do you know what you are doing
trust me
come off it jack of course you can check to see if she is been arrested
i am sorry sam i am afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked
you do not really think tuttle and the girl are in league
jack she is innocent
sam  we have always been close have not we
yes we have jack
jack jack
shut up
how could you do this to me
help me jack i am frightened
i want to report a wrongful arrest

think reggie you have got to think  it may be what we are looking for
that money's not ours adam  if we keep it we will be breaking the law
nonsense we did not steal it there's no law against stealing stolen money
now what
five o'clock  thursday  the garden  it is got to be something around here
but charles' appointment was last week not 
i know but this is all we have got left
it is hopeless  i do not even know what we are looking for
it is all right  i do not think tex does either
reggie  stop
why so you can kill me too tex is dead i have seen him he said dyle did it
i am not dyle  you know that
but tex did not  he still thought  
reggie  why will not you listen
but i did not kill anybody
he is  with the cia  i have seen him at the embassy
reggie  listen to me
you lied to me so many times 
reggie  trust me once more  please
can i really believe you this time adam
you did not have to chase me so hard 
and that is all the gratitude i get for saving your hide
the truth now  was it my hide  or the stamps
i said tell me to go to the 
i heard you i heard you
then say it
reggie  listen to me 
i am sorry  my secretary must have gone to lunch you are  
mrs lampert  mrs charles lampert
mr bartholomew  are you sure you know who i am
have some please i have got  liverwurst  liverwurst  chicken and  liverwurst
do you know what cia is mrs lampert
i do not suppose it is an airline is it
central intelligence agency  cia
you mean spies and things like that
only we call them agents
we you mean you are 
someone has to do it mrs lampert 
yes  that all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he is in business
that is all this got to do with me mr bartholomew
your husband was wanted by the u s government
to be more specific he was wanted by this agency
so that was it
yes we knew him of course by his real name
very sweet
are not they  now look at this one mrs voss and 
stop calling me that lampert's the name on the marriage license
mrs lampert i am afraid you are in a great deal of danger
danger why should i be in any danger
you are charles voss's wife  now that he is dead you are their only lead
mr bartholomew  if you are trying to frighten me you are doing a really firstrate job 
please do what we ask mrs lampert  it is your only chance
but it is charles's money not theirs
oh mrs lampert i would love to see you try and convince them of that  oh dear
oh i see
and i am afraid we want it back
but i do not have it
that is impossible you are the only one who could have it
i believe you
thanks very much
oh you have got the money all right  you just do not know you have got it
mr bartholomew  if i had a quarter of a million dollars believe me i would know it
nevertheless mrs lampert  you have got it
wait a minute  you think those three men killed charles do not you
we have no proof of course but we rather think so yes
why not
where are you now  can you meet me do you know les halles
what did you want to see me about mr bartholomew
dyle or whatever his name is
what does your mr dyle look like mrs lampert
he is hardly my mr dyle
no what
there's only one dyle connected with this affair mrs lampert  that is carson
mr bartholomew  why did not you tell me you knew about dyle
i did not see any point dyle's dead
i suppose you are old enough to have heard of world war two
gratine choucroute garnie salade de pommes  et un ballon de rouge
mrs lampert i really had not planned on spending the entire night here
have you any idea what these things cost over here
please go on mr bartholomew  what happened then
but what has all this got to do with the cio
well if i am going to die i might as well do it for my country
that is the spirit
oh stop it what do you want me to do
we are anxious to know who this man is  the one calling himself dyle
maybe he really is dyle he could still be alive
no mrs lampert
but no one actually saw him die
no mrs lampert his death is registered with the war department in washington
oh then who's this one
i do not know  but i think you would better find out do not you
me why me
mrs lampert  bartholomew i have spoken to washington mrs lampert 
are you sure there's no mistake
it is charles
very good
he looks so young  when was this taken
yes  and he was there too  a little fatter now  and less hair  but it is the same one
that is a face you do not forget  he was there too 
herman scobie and you have never seen him before either
well of all the mean rotten contemptible crooked 
crooked i should think you would be glad to find out i was not crooked
you could not even be honest about being dishonest why did not you say something
we are not allowed to tell may i have the stamps please
here   wait a minute  how did carson dyle get an office in here anyway
when did you see him  what time i mean
then how do i know this is your office
 recommending that all embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour
starting with his own
okay now  hand over those stamps
brian cruikshank  it would serve me right if i got stuck with that one
who asked you to get stuck with any of them
my mother  she lives in detroit come on now  give me those stamps
only if you can prove to me that you are really brian cruikshank
how about if next week some time i put it on a marriage license  that ought to 
quit stalling  i want to see some identification  now
i would not lie on a thing like that  i could go to jail
you would lie about anything
well maybe we would better forget about it then
you cannot prove it can you you are still trying to   marriage license did you say  
if you do anything funny or try to talk to anyone i will kill you dyle  here and now okay
what now
how long do you intend  
sorry about that
do i knock or something
keep going
very pretty now what
and i say maybe you both have it one more time dyle  where is it
supposing i did have it  which i do not  do you really think i would hand it over
back where
and stop threatening that boy he does not have the money mrs lampert does not either
then who does
not my room
we would better exchange keys here's mine
it is the only name i have got how about you
no cat and mouse  you have got me what do you want to know
why you lied to me
i had to  for all i knew you could have been in on the whole thing
well you know now so please tell me who you are
but you know my name  it is dyle
carson dyle is dead
did not anyone ever tell you it is impolite to   what happened
i left him hanging around the american express
does it hurt
are you really carson dyle's brother
would you like to see my passport
your passport what kind of a proof is that
okay i will drive you around there some day  ouch
is there a mrs dyle
yes but we are divorced
i thought that was peter joshua
i am no easier to live with than he was
alex  how can you tell if someone is lying or not
you cannot
why could not you just look at his feet
because he is wearing moccasins
oh well then he is a truthful whitefoot of course
why not a lying blackfoot
which one are you
whitefoot of course
i hope it turns out you are a whitefoot alex  i could be very happy hanging around the tepee
reggie  listen to me 
ohoh  here it comes the fatherly talk you forget i am already a widow
so was juliet  at fifteen
i am not fifteen
well there's your trouble right there  you are too old for me
why cannot you be serious
there you said it
what are you doing
cutting it out
who told you to do that
you did
now please reggie  cut it out
the phone's ringing 
they have got jeanlouis
that sounds like their problem
hello herman it was a happy landing i see
come on  let's get busy who gets your vote
because i really suspect gideon  and it is always the person you do not suspect
do women think it is feminine to be so illogical  or cannot they help it
i would love some thanks
i am scared
do not worry i am not going to hit you
hurry up and change  i am starved
got you
did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf
reggie  open the door
this is a ludicrous situation there must be dozens of men dying to use my shower
then i suggest you call one of them
what are you doing
i usually sing a medley of old favorites when i bathe  any requests
shut the door
the suit needs it more than i do anyway
every day the manufacturer recommends it
reggie  you have not spoken a word in twenty minutes
i keep thinking about charles and scobie  and the one who's going to be next  me
what do i have to do to satisfy you  become the next victim
i can explain if you will just listen will you listen
i cannot very well leave without a pair of water wings
okay then get set for the story of my life  not that it would ever make the bestseller list
fiction or nonfiction
are you going to listen
i suppose all this is leading somewhere
it led me away from umbrella frames for one thing but that left me without any honest means of support
i do not believe it
monsieur flix  
have you ever in your entire life seen anything so beautiful
how much is it worth
the money is unimportant
i am afraid it is important
in your money perhaps $65000
that is its value today
in human life in greed in suffering
in money
fortyfive thousand
do you have anything to eat  and the orange one  what about the orange one
a twopenny mauritius  issued in 1856 not so rare as the others  $30000 perhaps
please keep it
i am  i am sorry
i suggest you get about your business  nothing soothes herman like success
what for if it is not here why bother him
and if it is
you sure nuthings missing
there sure ai not nothing here worth no quarter of a million
not unless we are blind
you think that mebbe we are fishing the wrong stream
you know i would tell you if i had it
nachurly jus' like i would tell you
what do you mean no
mrs lampert 
what do you want
did not charles tell you mrs lampert
tell me what
it does not belong to you mrs lampert  you do know that do not you
i do not know anything
mrs lampert any morning now you could wake up dead
leave me alone  
dead mrs lampert  like last week's news  like charles mrs lampert 
i am afraid that will have to wait mrs lampert
but his mother 
you loved him
your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'maranguape' it sailed from bordeaux for maracaibo this morning at seven
oh swiss his profession
he did not have one
he was a wealthy man
i do not know i suppose so
about how wealthy would you say
i do not know
where did he keep his money
i do not know
besides yourself who is his nearest relation
i do not know
c'est absurde madame totalement absurde
i know  i am sorry
is it all right
i do not know perhaps he met somebody
obviously  one ticket of passage to south america  one letter stamped but unsealed addressed to you 
we took the liberty of calling your dentist  we thought perhaps we would learn something
if you will sign this list you may take the things with you
is that all can i go now
of course it is
i do not understand
i was too
in mr dyle's room
no  in my room
oh la
yes of course  but if you went back and wrote me a letter 
oh la if i find the treasure will i win a prize
come on now  if you wanted to hide something where would you put it
i know i would bury it in the garden
swell  only this man does not have a garden
oh  neither do i  voil
voil what
i found it i found it
if you think you are getting credit for this you are crazy
up there it is up there
jeanlouis  thank heavens do you have    that is that
a man traded with me  all those for only four
but he is gone
i do not blame him jeanlouis  do you know where this monsieur flix lives
oh forgive me  is this yours
it is hers where would you find him robbing a bank
he was throwing snowballs at baron rothschild  we do not know each other do we
why do you think we are going to
how is that
clever fellow  almost missed me
i am afraid you are blocking my view
peter joshua
i am regina lampert
good for you
no it is not i am getting a divorce
please not on my account
no you see i do not really love him
well you are honest anyway
yes i am  i am compulsive about it  dishonesty infuriates me like when you go into a drugstore
oh i guess
is there a mrs joshua
yes but we are divorced
that was not a proposal  i was just curious
mr joshua  well i have enjoyed talking with you
now you are angry
no i am not  i have got some packing to do i am also going back to paris today
oh well was not it shakespeare who said when strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again
shakespeare never said that
how do you know
it is terrible  you just made it up
well the idea's right anyway are you going to call me
are you in the book
charles is
how did you find out
it is in all the afternoon papers i am very sorry
i rang the bell but i do not think it is working
where did everything go

what it is worse you are pregnant with an asian design major's child
i am not pregnant

i would have told you and you would have stopped calling like a baby
how do you know that
because i know you you prefer drastic measures to rational ones
thanks for the vote of confidence

let me take you out tonight
you mean on a date

want something to drink i am buying
no thanks
you do not want to know
you called caitlin again
she called me
did you tell veronica
one fight a day with veronica is about all i can stomach thanks
i will bet the most frequent topic of arguments is caitlin bree
seven months
chick's nuts about you how long did you date caitlin
five years
chick only made you nuts she cheated on you how many times
eight and a half
that is cheating
in the middle of it she calls me brad
she called you brad
she called me brad
that is not cheating people say crazy shit during sex one time i called this girl mom
i hit the lights and she freaks turns out she thought i was brad michaelson
oh my god

that girl was vile to you
interesting postscript to that story do you know who wound up going with brad michaelson in the other dark bedroom
your mother
allan harris
chess team allan harris

that is frightening
because there was a lot of good in our relationship
oh shit i have got to place an order
i am talking to myself here
caitlings on the same wavelength
i think it is safe to say yes
then i think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over
all four
do you know that article is accurate caitlings really getting married
you know what i just watched
me pulling a can off some morongs fist
return of the jedi
did not you hear me caitlin really is getting married
that is that
all right vader's boss
the emperor
right the emperor now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes
it would stand to reason yes
hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution
you know what else i noticed in jedi
there's more
now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it
luke blew it up give credit where it is due
and the second one was still being built when they blew it up
so when they blew it up no prob evil is punished
and the second time around
she is in here
that is he looking for
he said he has to find a perfect dozen
perfect dozen
each egg has to be perfect
the quest is not going well
why does not he just mix and match
what did he say
he said it was important to have standards he said nobody has pride anymore
did you ever notice all the prices end in nine damn that is eerie
you know how much money the average jizzmopper make per hour
that is a jizzmopper
he is the guy in those nudiebooth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off
nudie booth
nudie booth you have never been in a nudie booth

liar tell me there are not customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis

how can you lie like that why do not you vent vent your frustration come on who pisses you off
it is not really anyone per se it is more of separate groupings
let's hear it
the milkmaids

because my exgirlfriend is getting married
can you come next door i gotta make a phone call
smokey three thumbs up am i right

he did not mention it when he called you this morning
not a fucking word slippery shit
i heard you apologize why you have every right in the world to be mad
i know
that seems to be the leitmotif in your life ever backing down
you know what pisses me off the most
the fact that i am right about your buckling
i am going to miss the game
because you buckled
would you shut the hell up with that shit it is not helping
see there you go again
i cannot believe i am going to miss the game
at least we are stuck here together

i am not missing that is probably going to be the social event of the season
you hate people
but i love gatherings is not it ironic

if you go i go
she meant nothing to you
she meant nothing to you either until i told you she died
i am not taking you to this funeral
i am going with you
i cannot close the store
you just closed the store to play hockey on the roof
you were saying
she was pretty young hunhh

his dick was in his mouth
balls resting on his lips

i know it was a bad idea to close the store
i cannot fucking believe you
i am telling you it was not my fault
you knocked the fucking casket over for chrissakes
i was just leaning on it it was an accident
does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose
so the casket fell over big deal
her fucking body fell out
so they will put her back in it is not like it is gonna matter if she breaks something

may i be blunt with you
that is stretching it you are not being asked to slay children or anything
what the fuck did you do that for
you are a danger to both the dead and the living
i like to think i am a master of my own destiny
please get the hell out of here
get to work
what would you rent  best of both worlds
hermaphroditic porn starlets with both organs you should see the box beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame
and this is what you rented
i like to expand my horizons
i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor
no way
five hundred dollars
i did not think they even enforced this
living proof
i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids
little girl maybe five years old
holy shit that girl
as opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here
then how come you got the fine
because i am here
you are lying
i swear i could not make this kind of hell up
then why are not you like screaming at me right now
because i am happy

what did she say
she is not going to marry that guy she went home to tell her mother
you are kidding
i am not
wow you have had quite an evening
she went home she is getting ready and we are going out
i feel so ineffectual is there anything i can do for you
watch the store while i go home and change
what happened to title dictates behavior
this is my way of spitting water at life
you are a snake
in my absence try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns
all right but you are missing out chicks with dicks
i love your sexy talk it is so kindergarten poopoo weewee

how do you figure
what time did you get to work today
like ten after
you were over half an hour late then all you do is come over here

listen to you oh shit oh i do not hang out with drug dealers
i work just like you you are more of a crook than i am dude
it is not my store
and these are not my drugsi just sell them
the difference is you exploit a weakness
that is that mean
you sell to people that cannot stay away from an addiction
all right how much is pepsi here
a dollar sixtynine plus tax
i cannot believe you just rolled a joint in here
hey man what happened with that old guy
he died in the bathroom
that is fucked up yo i heard he was jerking off
knock it off that used to be my girlfriend
you used to go out with her
we were going to start again i think
i jacked the car up all she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on
damn she sure goes out of her way
i am sure he was not sleeping
you calling me a liar
no he was probably just resting his eyes
what the hell is that resting his eyes it is not like he is some goddamned air traffic controller
if you will just tell me the title of your rental choice i will have him hold it for you
be careful
i am trying
you know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer
so i am told
and he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass
no he got hit by a bus
oh can i help you
well that depends do you have a bathroom
uh sure go ahead it is back through the cooler
thanks son saywhat kind of toilet paper you got back there
the white kind
i am not asking about the color i mean is it rough or cottony
yeah but
aw c'mon boy that is the difference you said yourself the stuff that is there now is rough
yeah okay go ahead
jesus go ahead
you know you probably could have been home already in the time it is taken you to get in there
can i trouble you for one of those magazines
i said go ahead
the porno mags
yeah i like the cartoons they make me laugh they draw the biggest titties
here now leave me alone
all right stupid question but do not you think you are taking this a bit too hard
too hard i do not have enough indignities in my lifepeople start throwing cigarettes at me
at least they were not lit
i hate this fucking place
then quit you should be going to school anyway
please veronica last thing i need is a lecture at this point
all i am saying is that if you are unhappy you should leave
i am not even supposed to be here today
i know i stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something
the guy got sick and could not come in
do not you have a hockey game at two
yes and i am going to play like shit because i did not get a good night's sleep
why did you agree to come in then
i am only here until twelve then i am gone the boss is coming in
why do not you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here
somebody jammed the locks with gum
you are kidding
bunch of savages in this town
you look bushed what time did you get to bed
i do not knowlike twothirty three
what were you doing up so late
hunhh nothing
what were you doing
nothing jesus i gotta fight with you now
what what is that
you are trusting
why do you say that
how do you know they are taking the right amount of change or even paying for what they take
theoretically people see money on the counter and nobody around they think they are being watched
honesty through paranoia why do you smell like shoe polish
i had to use shoe polish to make that sign the smell will not come off
do you think anyone can see us down here
why you wanna have sex or something
i was kidding
yeah right you cannot get enough of me
typically male point of view
how do you figure
you show some bedroom proficiency and you think you are gods what about what we do for you
women women as lovers are all basically the same they just have to be there
be there
making a male climax is not all that challenging insert somewhere close and preferably moist thrust repeat
how flattering
now making a woman cum therein lies a challenge
oh you think so
a girl makes a guy cum it is standard a guy makes a girl cum it is talent
and i actually date you
i touched a nerve
i am astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life
it was not directed at you i was making a broad generalization
you were making a generalization about broads
these are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me
how many
how many what
how many girls have you slept with
how many different girls did not we already have this discussion once
we might have i do not remember how many
including you
you have slept with twelve different girls
what the hell was that for
you are a pig
why would you hit me
do you know how many different men i have had sex with
three including you
you have only had sex with three different people
no who were the three besides me
john franson and rob stanslyk
animal vegetable or mineral
vegetable meaning paraplegic
they put up the least amount of struggle
after dropping a bombshell like that you owe me big
all right name it
to school there's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment
shit why are we getting up
why do you call him that
sylvan made it up it is a blow job thing
he requested this
he gets off on it
sylvan can be talked into anything
why do you say that
like you saidshe snowballed him
sylvan no i snowballed him
yeah right
you sucked that guy's dick
yeah how do you think i know he liked
but but you said you only had sex with three guys you never mentioned him
that is because i never had sex with him
you sucked his dick
we went out a few times we did not have sex but we fooled around
oh my god why did you tell me you only slept with three guys
because i did only sleep with three guys that does not mean i did not just go with people
oh my godi feel so nauseous
i am sorry dante i thought you understood
i did understand i understand that you slept with three different guys and that is all you said
please calm down
how many dicks have you sucked
let it go
something like thirtysix
what something like thirtysix
lower your voice
what the hell is that anyway something like thirtysix does that include me
um thirtyseven
i am thirtyseven
i am going to class
no but you sucked enough dick
yeah i went down on a few guys
i feel sick
i love you do not feel sick
i am going to school maybe later you will be a bit more rational
thirtyseven i just cannot
he still has not shown up why are not you in class
lit 101 got canceled so i stopped home and brought you some lunch
what is it
peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off what do you think it is it is lasagne
really  you are the best
you had to tell him
i had to tell someone he put it into perspective
what did he say
at least he was not thirtysix
and that made you feel better
and he said most of them are college guys i have never met or seen
the ostrich syndrome if you do not see it
it is not there yes
thank you for being rational
thank you for the lasagne
you could not get these shutters open
i called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow
bummer well i have gotta head back for the onethirty class
what are you talking about
you have been talking to her on the phone for weeks
it was only a few times
and then you pull that shit this morning freaking out because i have gone down on a couple guys
and having him tell me that was just the weakest move ever you are spineless
veronica i love you
you hold the counter and i will pull
usually i just turn the can upside down
maybe we should soap your hand or something
they oughta put some kind of warning on these cans like they do with cigarettes
thanks i thought i was gonna have to go to the hospital
i will throw this out precautionary measure
it stings a little
you open
yes  i am not out of shape
were you working here at about four o'clock
i am not out of shape

you have never heard anybody say anything about either movie
i find it is best to stay out of other people's affairs
i just held up the same two movies you are not even paying attention
no i was not
i do not think your manager would appreciate
i do not appreciate your ruse ma'am
i beg your pardon
your ruse your cunning attempt to trick me
i only pointed out that you were not paying any attention to what i was saying
i hope it feels good

what are you thinking jerry
water mains usually go in the winter  it is august 1st
mekong my friend mekong
you know flip vietnam war was fought because of a bet howard hughes lost to aristotle onasis
sure  and the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone  nearly snapped me in half
ujerryu  you did not show last night  first time ever  had me worried boy
saved you last night's too
flip was a hero in vietnam
i do not see the connection
come on  six major earthquakes in the last three years  the space shuttle in orbit for every one of them
testing some top secret seismic weapon
i still do not see what it has to do with the president
do you still ride
not for years
so why do you keep the picture up you wish you had not quit
he is cutting funding for nasa the milk cow of the aerospace industry  we are talking billions motive enough
unasau is going to kill the president of the united states with an earthquake
you going to warn him
i cannot promise you anything
you think i am crazy
i better get going
what was your horse's name
johnny dancer  you have been in my office ten times  how come you never asked me about that picture before
i bit the bastard's nose off
you bit someone's nose off
put down the gun and i will take your statement  okay
that is the charge
just relax
switch 'em  or i will be dead by morning  do not want to be dead
hey  i cannot control it  it is just something that happened
people do have heart attacks
you switched the charts you tell me
i will not be here when you get back but i will be in touch  and thanks
for what
you saved my life
he says a dog bit his nose
arf you gotta help me
lucky guess um i would feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here
do not tell me you are naked back there
what took so long  you were in there all day
that is how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out  a lot of people are after you jerry
dead or alive they will stick me in there with oswald  another lunatic acting alone
oswald was an assassin  you are not an assassin are you jerry
if you are worried about the president call and warn him about the space shuttle
right  sit up so i can see you
uh uh do not want uthemu to see me
them who
crown victoria  fbi car  a legitimate tail
that is how a man would do it  i am not a man
see  was not that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans
nothing is easy
how long have we known each other jerry
you have the right to ask me certain personal questions
nothing scary there  sorry
that is it
so why are they after you
i am not sure  i think i figured something out  it must have been in my newsletter
so i am a little jumpy  who would not be
you are certifiable
you would not be sitting here if you did not halfway believe me
you okay
you know why the grateful dead are always on tour
you want something to drink
if my universe had a hub
i have been reading up on it
can you prove any of this
pretty scary huh
yeah how many subscribers do you have
just five  it is the economy you think maybe one of them is not who they seem
holden caulfield  ucatcher in theu uryeu
never heard of him
what are you doing
was that who i thought it was
uh huh
has this happened to you before
never but i have been practicing
who are you jerry
it made me feel like you could see inside of me  and i do not know how that is possible
so that is the question
i will give you 100 bucks if you leave right now
is this your dad
that was him
is he dead
please put it down
how would he die
he is why you punish yourself
johnny dancer right  you do not ride him anymore do you  not since your dad died
did you see the van back there
what van
never mind  you would think i was making it up
where would you get your subscribers
i put an ad on a computer bulletin board  i log on at the library so i cannot be traced
well i have been tracking them down all morning
maybe you better not try i worked so hard to keep quiet like a mouse  i should have realized
realized what
and you think group one is at war with group two
latest casualty  ernest harriman you heard of him
sure one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago
right here in manhattan
i see the big picture and you stumble around in the details
they are big details jerry
do you watch the news  read the paper  last week this whole place was underwater
okay i will
you will
i like you jerry  a lot
oh christ here it comes  look i know you think i am crazy  i do not think i am but
jerry i 
what if i reached a point where you did not think i was crazy anymore  if i was normal
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking cocacola again
yeah  would you i mean could you love me then  if i was normal  maybe
you are wrong  since i met you i do not dream about holes anymore
holes  i do not know what you are talking about
yesterday you were wondering about the wall  how it was possible
i would never hurt you liza think whatever you want but do not think that
i do not  i know you would not
no  that would not be fair  where are we going jerry
what is it
we are going to queens
now what
after you  it is okay  i am the one who left it here
john hinkley  the guy who shot reagan  he only had two names
my father's house
did you kill him
is that what they told you
then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box
he gave it to me
i do not understand
where were you the day he died
at a horse show
that is the last time you rode is not it  do you think it was your fault  is that why
yeah  i know what it is like
uwhy not jerryu
i believe you
you got to get out of here  my cell phone's on  back in the truck
they will trace it
i am sorry
blue moon blue moon
blue moon
without a song in my heart
blue moon
how did you know
get in  i will pull you up to the fourth floor
what about you
geronimo is down
it is up  love gives you wings you can fly away from here
do not die on me jerry  okay
you have been my best friend for years and i did not even know you were out there
they changed franklings portrait
you think it is a conspiracy
i love you too
do i know you
i am a very patient man
that is great  good for you
who have you been talking to jerry  who else knows what you know
that is that
you should not watch jerry  it is a moment without hope
liza sutton is dead
thank you
i am not sure what you mean
you should think of me as liza suttongs guardian angel
that is ironic  because we are here to protect her from you
you are here because you figured i might show up
you made your decision yet
i will do it  on one condition  i want to make sure she is okay
we got someone watching her 24 hours a day  she 
that is not what i mean  i want to see her
i do not know
then screw you  i will rot
can i ask you something
a dog bit it
excuse me
you were going to ask about my nose  the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today
and you feel bad for it
so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president
you already asked me that  why do you insist on making me repeat myself
and you have no idea where he lives
i am sorry  what was the question again
uwhy youu
honestly  i think he has a crush on me
a charming term  now uwhy himu
excuse me
veritas  truth  what is it they say about truth
the truth shall make you free
that is it  i went to yale  i hope you will not hold that against me
i did not know the cia had psychiatrists
we are very specialized
fine  what the hell is going on
years ago i worked for the cia in the mk ultra program  are you familiar with it
it was mind control  umanchurianu ucandidateu kind of stuff right
a vulgar pop term but yes  take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin  that was our goal
ask what you can do for your country  that kind of thing
mk ultra was terminated in 1973 but not the research it was renamed  ex catcher
as in ucatcher in the ryeu
missionary  penance  you talk about it like it was a religion
jerry told me he bit your nose
and what did i say
a dog
umy dogu  one i intend to put to sleep  extrapolate from there
these things you are talking about you did them to jerry
i am still listening
jerry is dangerous  jerry has killed 
where would you get it
you do recognize it then
it was my father's  kept it in his wallet  he was murdered 
i know the story  a federal judge  he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial
not a man  ezekiel walters
walters had nothing to do with your father's murder
in jerry's safety deposit box
it is okay  i am game
night after that
look you are a nice guy but i am not really dating right now
i am not that good at 'no' liza

it makes perfect sense  field work is not our oeuvre
i do not like it  something's wrong
dr jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate  why is that
we are waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up  this guy fletcher's something else

what are you looking to read
but you are checking it out
you missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner
i was not hungry
john even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into mrs hallstrom's milk
finally i was getting tired of watching him try every night
he asked me to marry him
very romantic setting
it was romantic   he is very romantic
what have you done with the ring

really this is not funny
for a price
good god

nervous scared worried you are not fit for a caper of epic proportions
do not be ridiculous
a daisy for the lady
the lady knows this is a dandelion
thanks    where have you been all day
i am not allowed to see you anymore
wow    i am bad news
that is my rap
really though my thoughts go haywire sometimes
shocking huh
sure but i took out a whole grocery store
i wish i could have seen that
you must have thought about it everyone does
i just want to see beast  where would you go
the mission up in santa barbara
no way
and we would eat spaghettio's in bed from the can
how can you even mention spaghetti o's after eating grandma rosa's dinner tonight
i have a terrible confession
tell the doctor
then it is over
it is a good thing my family loves you
do you
i do
michael i
it is ok you do not have to say anything
john and nurse gates are waiting for you

i better make a list
are not you supposed to throw a bouquet or something
where to
this is it  3b     check it out
i love the pillows
throw pillows letty the sales lady said they are the latest thing

i was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch now we can watch two shows at once
you have got to see the kitchen first
do you like it
what do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate
how can you not like the top 10 list
i like it     but headlines are better
not yet
i am supposed to meet the principal in half an hour
good luck
this must be beast
i bombed it is either work in the office or nothing
sounds grim
who ever said sanity was fun

i think i should go home

and all the plans we have
like i have told you before i do not want you taking care of me
someone has to take care of you right now michael you tore up the apartment you stopped taking your medications
but that was not me    i did not mean to do that
well then why would it happen
i am sorry     i did not come here to blame you
i did not mean for any of this to happen
what are we going to do
what do you want to do
i love you so much
maybe we could just run away to tahiti and live on the beach
do not you have a magic trick or something to make this easier
would that really be such a good idea for either of us
just promise me you will be ok ok
i guess i should go now
so another one bites the dust
it is not another one it is my sister  are not you happy for her
can i put these here for tonight
believe me i know your feelings on the matter
my math program the superintendent said he would fund it
i was thinking dinner on friday with james and meg at the saint mark
actually i need to review the deposition questions tonight maybe tomorrow
oh ok   maybe
but i thought if you do not mind you could listen and see how i come across
what are you doing    you are going to be late
you do not have a fever
i do not feel like going to work today
but what about that math project
paul i just cannot go is that ok with you or am i committing some horrible crime
forget i asked
i am sorry  i am justi am so tired lately
maybe you ought to see a doctor
you can get out of the dinner
no i cannot i have already convinced both mom and dad to come
what are you doing
can you loan me a 20
sure why
i am going to the store
it is prettier here than i thought it would be
yeah i guess it is all right
are you all right
that is a big question
i hope it was not something i did
of course not no  is that why you are here
i think we need to talk about some things
yes i suppose so
especially this last year
especially now
i talked to ruth a little bit and i think it is about time
i know we cannot just keep going through the motions
exactly it is time to make decisions
you do not have to say anything else i have known for a while that this was coming
i had to smuggle it in here i guess you are not really supposed to have jewelry
no you have done a perfect job
no no
so will you
that is so urgent   you have got me worried
you what
it does not matter who
here's the ring
i am glad you agreed to see me
i am just glad there are not any hard feelings
how is work going    are you back at school
getting back
i heard your friend was back in the hospital
i think i have heard this speech before
i have got a deposition that i really need to get cracking on so if you do not mind
the superintendent was just getting ready to leave
believe me i wish i would understood what was going on i have worked really hard to get better
i am glad you are doing well
it is a very nice letter but i have to go with that is best for the students
what does that mean
i need someone to work on budget projections
office work
all tapped out
how is it look
shhh they are coming to the cubic zirconium
i like those sapphire earrings myself
mrs hallstrom why do not you join my family for dinner you will love my grandma rosa
you are back
how is the arm  still sore
much better  you have been gone so long
li mu bai is coming to stay the night
she is crazy  you should have killed her
i did not have the heart
who are you
i do not care about your sword
is not it a bit too late to be out you have brought me the sword
where is your master
stop talking like a monk  just fight
then tell me where jade fox is
on guard
why do you want to teach me
i have always wanted a disciple worthy of wudangs secrets
who are you  why is the green destiny in your possession
i am just playing around
tell me who is your master
you are home late or should i say early
i will never live as a thief
you are already a thief
that was just for fun  how can i leave  where would i go
wherever we want  we will get rid of anyone in our way  even your father
shut up
it is the giang hu fighter lifestyle kill or be killed exciting is not it
i owe you nothing
you think you have been teaching me all these years from the manual you could not even decipher the symbols
in that case perhaps we could be of assistance
do not bother
you do not seem to understand
are you related to li mu bai
please sit
i have made you silk pajamas  do you want to change into them
put them down
i heard you met shu lien today
do you know her
i will socialize with whomever i please
i am tired now
go to bed then  miss has grown up and is getting married soon  god knows what the future will bring
it will be just the same  enough i am tired
this spells trouble
exquisite  you said it belongs to
my friend li mu bai  he is given it to sir te as a gift
li mu bai  the famous warrior why would he give his sword to sir te
you are too young to understand
it must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free
fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we would not survive for long
i have read all about people like you roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way
writers would not sell many books if they told how it really is
but you are just like the characters in the stories
sure  no place to bathe for days sleeping in fleainfested beds they tell you all about that in those books
you know what i mean  i am getting married soon but i have not lived the life i want
so i heard  congratulations  it is the most important step in a womangs life is not it
you are not married are you
what do you think
no  you could not roam around freely if you were
i have missed you
how so
you are doing calligraphy
you write gracefully  calligraphy is so similar to fencing
do you think so  let me tell you a story
about you and li mu bai
yes  did you know i was once engaged to be married
too bad for meng but it is not your fault or li mu bai's
i am not an aristocrat as you are but i must still respect a womangs duties
do not distance us  from now on let's be like sisters
you say she killed a policeman
here you must be in proper attire
i am just borrowing some clean clothes  i am not staying
i will give them to you
they forced me to marry
go back to them first  then you can decide about lo
you know about lo
he really loves you  come back to peking with me  we will find a solution
where is he now
li mu bai has made arrangements he sent him to wudan mountain
do not touch it  that is li mu bai's sword
come and get it if you can
without the green destiny you are nothing
take my horse and go to the compound give this to mrs wu  she will help you  hurry
stop it  you do not deserve the green destiny
not another lecture  on guard
let's end this here
what do you want
what i have always wanted to teach you
let's stop a moment
give it back
you have got quite a temper  it is better this way
you coward
no more hitting on the head  all this trouble for a comb
it is mine  it means a lot to me a barbarian like you would not understand
not true  i can use it to pick fleas from my horse
by the way i am a real manchurian
i am sorry i guessed wrong  i though you were a han
give me back my comb
i do not take orders from anyone
so you are still that little boy looking for shooting stars
your father's men are still looking for you  they are still out there circling closer
let them look
keep it safe  return it to me when we are together again
i will
do you remember the legend of the young man
a faithful heart makes wishes come true
mu baiit is been too long
it has  how is business
the mountain must be so peaceful i envy you  my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest
i left the training early
what was it
something i cannot let go of  you are leaving soon
we are preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking
the green destiny sword  you are giving it to sir te
i am  he has always been our greatest protector
i do not understand  how can you part with it  it has always been with you
too many men have died at its edge it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade
you use it justly you are worthy of it
it is time for me to leave it behind
sir te believes it is a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu
but something is going on at the yu household
jade fox  impossible
you always suspected she would fled to the west
i did not think she would dare come back to peking
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu
it was bo sir te's man  i hear he followed the thief to the yus'
have you questioned him yet
no not yet
that is not what i meant  i do not care about the sword
what do you mean  did not you come back here for it
i do not know it was stolen until i got here
then why did you come
i admit getting it back makes me realize how much i would missed it
you did your job well  but this girl i saw her last night
i knew she would intrigue you
that is not for her  she should come to wudan and become a disciple
but wudan does not accept women
for her they might make an exception  if not i am afraid she will become a poisoned dragon
it is not our affair  even if wudan accepts her her husband might object
i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world but the cycle of bloodshed continues
i wish there were something more i could do to help you
do not you want to see her again
not everything is an illusion  my hand was not that real
we are close to your headquarters go home and check in
what about you
i will look around and catch up later
what happened
jade fox drugged her  how did you get here
mu bai hold on  give me some hope
shu lien
save your strength
madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts  she is being so considerate
i am sorry she is not feeling well enough to receive you today
that is good  sometimes the help cannot keep their hands to themselves it is very embarassing
sir te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families
but do not be too lenient
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking
maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same
it is jade fox
they are gone
what does it say
if you surrender now you will suffer less  but if you resist i will not stop until you are dead
please sir te what is it
li mu bai giving up his sword and his warrior days maybe he is trying to tell you something
has governor yu ever seen the sword
yes though i doubt he is involved in this
but the sword could be in his compound
this is a delicate matter
sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter
what do you have in mind
i am kathryn
have we met
i do not think so
did you know sebastian well
you might say that
now i remember annette harrison your father's the new headmaster at oakwood
that is right
are you okay
i will be fine
oh cut the shit kathryn
excuse me
kathryn i know all about you and sebastian
sebastian was a pathological liar i would not believe a word he 
i have his journal
you did not show it to anybody
actually i was planning on running down to kinkos do you think you could give me ride
you cannot do this to me it could ruin me
he told you he is failing in love with you i have never known him to say those words before
really i thought he said it all the time
is there a mutual feeling between you two
no i mean i do not know  what else do you know about him
not a whole lot we take some classes together he is got a bad rep but it is mostly bullshit
what do you mean
well a lot of people are jealous cause he is loaded
i do not know i have been hearing some awful things about him
from who
you promise not to say anything
why not
i do not know relationships seem too distracting i would rather concentrate on my studies
are you often this offensive on a first encounter
i read your teen beat manifesto
you did
i must say i found it rather appalling
that is a first most people praised me for it
oh really
take yourself you have slept with several women are you happier because of it
how do you know i have been with several women
a friend wrote me
well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip
who the hell is taking the time to write letters spreading this shit about me
it is not really important
fine forget it it is obvious that we are not going to be friends
excuse me excuse me
what'cha reading
the fountainhead
great book
romantic he rapes her
that is a matter of opinion
you need help
why do not you come join me for a swim and we will discuss it
at this hour i do not think so
oh come on quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool
give me a minute i will be right down
you know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible
i sincerely doubt it
the last thing i need is you going into my room searching for this while i am away
about what
about what you said today in the stable i am not a happy person
i never said that
you implied it
shut up
i was not kidding i would like to take you out
look i am flattered but seriously it could never work
why not
do you deny that there's an attraction between us
i do not i do not want to answer that look we are friends
i am sorry but you are not my type
you are naked
that is repulsive
need a lift
no thank you
how are you today
give it up
oh right last night i guess i owe you an apology
i am not going to speak to you till you realize that you cannot intimidate me
it was fine
i wish i could say the same for myself i was up thinking about you all night
i am sorry but i am not here to be your savior
well try this one on for size i think i am falling in love with you
you do not even know me
do not you believe in love at first sight
yes but only when it is mutual and this is far from mutual
ouch do you think we could spend some time together this morning

and you promise to abide by it
without question
i will leave this afternoon happy

you are going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady
that is okay it does not make you a bad person
yes it does
no it does not i am happy you are being honest with me
i cannot win with you
it is not about winning you know what your problem is you take yourself way too seriously
i do not
lighten up
am i bothering you
my friend monsieur philipe is a friend of florentino

where did you say she is from
kansas who the hell do i know in kansas
greg mcconnell
the football stud
he is from kansas city i would not be surprised if he was your rat
it would make sense mcconnell hates me i fingered his girlfriend at the game last year
i do not think that bothered him
what do you mean
let's just say greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field
too bad he is in kansas this summer
not anymore football team started practice last week he is already called me to hook up
really you think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf
do not think it is not going to cost you
i think he is telling the truth valmont greg could not write a grocery list let alone a letter
oh i suck i suck
ronald is one of the few high school students attending juliard he is composing his first opera
it is based on the life of doctor martin luther king

cecile i think you are going to have a hard time crying rape if that is all he did
what do i do then
cecile you had an orgasm

i do not know why do not you leave her alone
mcconnell i am gonna out your ass in two seconds if you do not tell me where she is
pleased to meet you
that is wrong
it is sebastian he is out of his mind
racist piece of shit
i would be careful if i were you god knows what he is up to
do you care to tell me what mrs whitetrash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house
lovely how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali zipping through my inheritance per usual
i do not find this very funny
i see your point though why should i care
i need you to seduce our young cecile introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery
sounds intriguing
oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge
i am not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas
you do not stand a chance even this is out of your league
care to make a wager on that
i will think about it
oh gee your journal could you be more queer
what are the terms
if you lose then that hot little porsche of yours is mine
i will give you something you have been jerking off about ever since our parents got married
be more specific
in english  i will fuck your brains out
what makes you think i would go for that bet that is a seventy thousand dollar car
you can put it anywhere
even there
fuck her yet
blow me
the plot thickens it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher
ooo i am sure mrs caldwell will love that
not to mention court reynolds unfortunately ronald's moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder
that is your plan of attack
i rat cecile out to mommy mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship boo hoo
i am at your service
thank you mmmm that feels good
i hate when things do not go my way it makes me so horny
moving along quite well
have you succeeded in your task
any day now
who are you spying on
shut up
and that is why you are losing your bet
i am not losing the bet it is just taking longer than i expected
so how would it go last night
if your asking if i nailed her the answer is no
she shot you down
exactly the opposite
you are telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you did not god are you a chump
if you are heading towards her room you will not find her
where is she
you do not know  she left thirty minutes ago
bad time
kind of
you did not
oh yes
tell me all the details
it was fantastic
no tell me
it was it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part
wow so you made love ooo i hear the birds chirping
some other time
excuse me
i am not in the mood
and that is why you are leaving
it clearly is why
i want to fuck
oh my god you are completely pwhipped
no i am not
pwhipped pwhipped
i am sorry it is just upsetting you are in love with her you do not love me anymore
oh come on kathryn it was just a contest
at first it was but now it is become something bigger
kathryn you know i love you i have always loved you
not anymore you do not it is obvious
i cannot believe you are reacting this way you are just saying this because you lost the bet
why so nervous
i have never done this before
how have you dumped girls in the past
a little melodramatic do not you think
i have a flair for drama
mind if i ask what you are doing in my room
devastated beyond repair i doubt she will ever trust a man again
i thought we should celebrate
well done
to my triumph of course
silly rabbit my triumph is not over her it is over you
in any event you still owe me my reward
get off me
will you calm down
i am very sorry about that i apologize
i accept now get out
get out we had an arrangement
get out
i am giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed
and if i do not
then i will consider it a declaration of war one two three
i think you have your answer
i got your message and came as quick as i could
i hope i did not keep you from something
not at all that is wrong
it is cecile
what about her
well you promise you will not say anything to her we have developed a friendship and
kathryn you have my word it is not drugs is it
it is worse i think there's something going on between cecile and her music teacher
ronald that is crazy
i cannot thank you enough
let me get that for you
oh please i cannot have you do that

is this dangerous or anything
no more than the usual
how much do you usually get paid
first lady
they barely talk anymore
you are kidding
now remember  keep it simple
that is with her
okay let's go over it again you met a girl you fell in love
and we are going away for a holiday
for a month
a month
right and do not embellish
i am not certain about
mr president
what the hell is this
lots of shelters were in this bill
uh mr president i do not believe that is on your agenda today
what do you think you are doing
you are nothing  do you understand me you are nobody
i am not nobody
you are lint  you are a flea  you are a blip
they say it hit both sides of his brain even if he makes it he is gonna be a vegetable
i cannot believe he would do this
where is the girl
look at some point we are going to have to call the vice president
just do not call him alan
the guy's in a coma bob
till what
tilt we figure something out
look everything can be handled  we will just find a way to handle it
like how
well start by going on television and saying that he is had a mild stroke
mild stroke
yes   and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon
a condition
you mean we get dave' to nominate you as vice president
is that everybody
duane's guys but he is got them under control
everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story
no one gets to be vice president by being that clean
nobody's got clean kids
okay let's see you can have him on tuesday the 25th
uh let me get back to you
you scheduled a whole day with the first lady
it is a homeless shelter
oh  excuse me
it is gonna be great  'caring about his wife'  'spending time on her favorite issue'
i do not want him caring about his wife what about the vice president
alan we still have to control this guy
and look at this  russell came around on the trade bill
you are kidding
how long have you been waiting to pass that thing
no  we did not anything
that is with the cameras
hundredth cabinet meeting  i thought it was a nice touch
do we have anything on the budget today
what are you gonna do
i am going to kill him
i can kill a hundred ordinary people
he is only doing what you told him to
well i did not mean it alan why the fuck would i want to save a homeless shelter
do not do this
i will lock him away for good
what do you mean by that
just what you think i mean
are you threatening me
so you want to go swimming
dave  i am working
oh yeah me too  you want to get dinner later
i was gonna do something with joan
i am serious dave  you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this
it is fine
they could put you in jail
i do not think so
this is undeclared income
and who's gonna find out
the government
i am not sure
i just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be
i am not surprised  can we save anywhere
you know  priorities  remember when you could not get your car fixed cause you wanted to get that piano
you could buy it on payments
yeah  that is how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit
thanks you did great  maybe later you could come back and we could go to camp david or something
that would be great
you sure  a coke or a perrier or something
in fact we think you did such a good job we would like to extend things a little bit
extend things
what happened
it is actually kind of serious dave i am afraid the president's not in very good shape
will he be alright
i am afraid so
you know on an empty road where you know it is safe and nobody's around
well i gues i would yeah
now  let's say the whole country was in that car   the entire united states of america
in the car
in the car
the teleprompter  is it hooked up
right  now whenever he stands at a podium the president always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat
thanks i wrote it
i thought you said i was not going to see her
it is just five minutes  she comes in you wave to the press she leaves
yeah but the first lady could not we start with a cousin or something
president vetoes works bill
let's call it a night   i cannot take any more
what do you mean you made it all up
we had to dave the guy's a choir boy
we have got to fix this
now he is making stuff up about me
yes mr president
you are spending fortythree million dollars on an ad campaign to  'boost consumer confidence in the american auto industry'
and it is proving quite effective
does it make the cars any better
well to shore up product identification and preserve market share
so we are spending fortyseven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they have already bought
this is from the people of burundi
oh thanks
what are they
they re not my attack dogs
what do you mean
oh hi
 sometimes they do
how would you get started
mr kovic   we are not here about your taxes
so how long have they been like that   you know him and the first lady
i cannot say
you mean you do not know or like  you cannot say
you got a gun
huh  you know what i always wondered the way they say you guys would take a bullet for the president
what about it
call bob and reed  tell them i need them immediately
i was waiting for that jack
you mean with you and everything
bleed for your king'
you are kidding
but bill was your king not bob
did not mean to bum you out
that is okay  you alright down here by yourself
the vicepresident
you sure you do not want a lift back home
i would have taken a bullet for i you dave
thanks for doing this ellen
you bet
do not you have anything to say to me
thanks for doing this ellen
i care about the homeless
that is wrong with a magic trick
i saw the light  i thought maybe you were up
oh yeah
that was quite a thing you did today
anybody would have done it
kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature
oh yeah  me too
i mean what is it  another secretary a jaunt to the bahamas with some 'campaign worker'  where is he
they asked me to help
you are leaving
i am not the first lady anymore  i should not be here

you1re leaving too
how were you gonna get home
you sure this goes somewhere
you do not have to keep walking with me   i am okay from here
he said he will pick it up in a couple of days
in fact  i am not anything like him and i guess i want you to know that
i really do not have much of an appetite
that is a secret
you have a lot of secrets
so what do you do the rest of the time
you know secretaries and stiff
you find people jobs
yeah  is that funny
it is just more than anybody else does around here
you know dave  it is dave is not it  i cannot keep all of this a secret
i know
it was okay
well i guess
i cannot
i know i am sorry
i mean i want to i just i feel strange
that is wrong
you really believe that
yeah  and it is better than not believing it their faces are inches apart
 thought i needed a little change  you like it

i never thought i would
i know
i missed

jury duty  that is randomly selected by social security numbers

that was beautiful robert i am surprised

it does not matter it was the feeling i was affected by
i did not have any
you think i am a fake
i think it is what you think
it is convenient to fake looking for something right now is not it
i am not faking anything i am looking for some bath oil
i do not find your language that charming
it is direct anyway which seems to be difficult for you
serious that is that is important to you
no do not do that
no inner feeling
that is right
that is what you said
as a matter of fact he is the one who introduced me to carl  how are you
i am fine
carl restored my confidence he really did he is much more substantial than you give him credit for
do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now
i could spend some time with you tomorrow morning before carl comes back i mean if you would like to
where are you going
i am going to pick up some friends of carl's are you all right
i have to talk to you

that is an old maid's tale
salesmen and cops are the ones if you would ever waitressed honey you would know

i would not be a waitress they are nasty and full of crap
you better hold onto your tongue
mass production is what does it
what do you mean mass i have to come out and tell you you are not that clean either
yeah it could be adorable
there's some good things on it though
pardon me
the tv there's some good things on it sometimes
the choice of words squashed flat juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten
i would like to remind you again this is not an opera or a musical comedy
oh i am sorry was i singing again
if you want to call it that
well you have to simply tell me that is all
that is exactly what i am doing again
do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first this is tiring me
i have a suggestion why do not we take a break
i used to drive a taxi
i used to be head of neurosurgery big hospital in ussr this hospital i am not kidding
very big
i opened thousands of brains
what did you find
i wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil i ate and drove i had one of those big checkered cabs
we must abandon
what do you mean we must abandon
we must abandon
contaminated substance very dangerous shooting mud
under the manhattan bridge
guys ready to order
this is a great young outofwork actress
say it again
alla puttanesca
nicky i was thinking about you i went to the preview last night
a lovely piece of theater small but important
shut up elliot
you are an artist i am a craftsman
press a button and they give us money
how is lillian i have not seen her
she wants a divorce
do not talk like that
it is over finished and done with
that sounds so final but are we really surprised
i am completely stunned i do not want this to happen
very dangerous
asbestos lining
we must abandon
i am trying to think when did you start looking so terrible you look awful
i can tell you the year the day the night the minute
you used to love life you do not exude this any more
what do i exude
suffering you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread
tonight you find out what it means to suffer
tonight that is tonight
shit they do not have any carrot soup
you mean because that ishisname
you will suffer because he is in the theater and you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears
it is just a review
it is just a review do not inhale very dangerous
that is the fuss i do not get it
that is what i said eighteen months ago
and he was there
steven schwimmer i memorized every word of this review
that is awful
i recite it to myself with masochistic relish
what was it like
is it safe
do we care
i think we nought to wait
i say we go
you say we go
do not inhale
i am not ready
where are you going
do not wait efor me
he carries a gun
i used to carry a gun when i drove a cab
where is it
i gave it away i thought i am a writer now
we are making too much of this
no we are not
i am not a lonely spooky writer like you nursing a hundred grudges i am a man who loves life
in other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse the man is out there ruining lives
it is your best play nicky
shoot him
the american theater does not need people like that
shoot him nicky not that we really mean it but where does he live
keep going west last building before the river
how do you eknow
paisley porter
had to be him
i think you are a little confused nothing personal friend
what are you talking about
what are we talking about
of course i saw it
did you see the winning run score
this could be it
this could be it
let's work on it
this could pbe it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
does it feel comfortable
does what feel comfortable
this could be it
last night alan albright called me a handsome woman second time he is done that son of a bitch
i hear alangs sick
alangs very sick he has to go to new mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution
you know about adele
what about her
she is dying
she died
i talked to her two days ago
apparently it did not help you know about peter of course
about what
steven schwimmer the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan
look all i want is a haircut i am not worried about this guy
ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater nobody in this business has been worried about anything else
the red sox
i am proud of this play it is so different from anything you have done
this is how we have managed to last
we are able to surprise each other
in and out of bed
because we are completely mismatched
it makes me so mad steven schwimmer ready to strike the exterminating angel
it is all worked out they will lose tonight then they will lose tomorrow i see it with stunning clarity
it is your best play nicky
they will lose because they are my team
i never see you anymore where are you all day
i go to college i thought you knew
do you want to get some coffee
i do not drink coffee daddy and this is not what we should be talking about
i am seeing your play tonight remember
that is completely crazy
is it
do not talk like that how prominent what are you implying
she is doing like those iranians i divorce thee i divorce thee i divorce thee'
if lawyers for the mob are called controversial why are divorce lawyers called prominent
because they get outstanding settlements and mother is determined that this time there's no turning back
because you refuse to believe she is serious you have always refused
you are too young to be studying criminal behavior it is making you obsessive
do not call her mother all the time it makes her sound tragic and unforgiving what happened to mom
i did not turn her into mother you did
laurel tickets are all set i doublechecked
thanks daddy but i just need one mother's not going
opening night
rogan laurel you also have a rogan lillian she will not need it sell it
take it yourself take a date
and you blame me it is because we never talk let's talk
i have a class i am late
can we talk later will you be at the party
will i believe you when you tell me something
i see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor
why will not you tell me your name
i am willing to tell you my name
you have to tell me what you thought of the play
first you tell me
what else
packs an emotional wallop
what else
we are strangers in the night the last thing we want is honesty
what do we want
mystery deception
deception is not something i personally consider sexy
that is sexy
knowing who a person is down deep
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking
yes and no more evasive tactics
it is your best play nicky
what else
your father said you might be here
we stranded five runners in the first two innings this will come back to haunt us
i want to be fairminded nicky
all right that is been going on
i have been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer
i will have whatever she is having
i do not want to be responsible for his food just a small green salad and a perrier
opening night lillian
who the hell cares
the whole thing is my fault i took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding you understand me
that is always been my problem
and you have been extremely patient
i would forgotten that
i went because you went you smoked because i smoked
that is very lovely actually
laurel wants us to be honest and open let's be open with each other
be open with me i would like that
there may be things you would rather not know about
i want to know we have not talked this way in years
i had an affair  are you sure you want to hear this
joanne bourne
alma wetzel
nicky no this is insupportable how could you
i am a man she is you know a woman
i am really deeply sorry
it violates so many trusts
it was an animal thing no real intimacy
i never thought of dr wetzel as having a sex life outside the office
we did it in the office she thought her apartment was too impersonal
i am glad we are having this talk
what happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you
that is it like to shoot somebody
great game red sox are winning
life is good
people are dependable
all the failures all the fatalism
washed away
it is stanley it is the steamer fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night
what did it say
a thousand things
this could be it
life is true
who is it
i am at the door
go way i will call a cop
pop will you let me in
where the hell are you
what do you want
it is me nicky
nicky comes on sunday's
where are your glasses go get them
if it is you what are you doing here
i am on my way to get a haircut
we must have been heroic
five's not so many there were families with seven kids a grandmother a dimwit uncle
lillian says it once a week why does not he come live with us'
but the son is suppose to stop crying
you will need these tonight for the play
since when did that matter
let's not start that again
my back is killing me
where is your elastic brace
i cannot find it
you are suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble
i lost it i lose everything
why does not he come live with us' because everything is here
so what are you going to do about it
what do you want me to do
everybody else does why not you
you are frankie lazzaro the gangster from rhode island
some little kid stole the hubcaps
the most charming gangster in new england where are we going mr lazzaro
call me frankie and it looks like we are going nowhere
might be an accident on the west side highway
how come you got the kid with you
matthew's my grandson
it is the kid's lucky day
this is one charming crook if shooting people is charming
now that is a complicated subject
you see what you are doing do not you
what am i doing
you are charming the boy
it is a complicated subject
your problem is you take the easy way out losing is easy
winning is easy losing is complicated it is a lifetime's work
say it and you will believe it life is good say it
i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments
then say it
life is good
because god loves a winner
washed away
because life is good
do not worry it is a test
this could be it
then they lost
why does it matter
if they lost tonight they will lose tomorrow it is all over
why do you care
they are my team
and you are not saying that because of the gun in my hand
aybe we ought to postpone the opening
joanna loves this play she has sunk tons of money she is completely ncommitted
i had lunch with joanna she said she told you about peter you were not concerned she said
hat was this morning
postpone we have every right
too late all the elements are in place delay the opening and we lose the theater
i have had three straight washouts sidney
i hate the mets

you have worked with elliot
i was in the fishmarket play what happened to him
there was a review
i think i remember
so does elliot
not one of stevengs finer moments
oh you know him
a little
and he has finer moments now and then
elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike
a little drastic maybe
you know what
alla puttanesca
you keep slipping away how do you do that
i was one of those silent listening children glued to the shadows
i was all noise played the radio loud battled constantly with my brother and sister here i am world
i hear good things about the new play
so do i over and over
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously
would you like to meet him
he does not want to meet some outof work ingenue
i am trying to prolong our afternoon in case you have not noticed
the fact is i have to get going
is it true
is what true
he wears a disguise
steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy no friends no phone
do you think he can do it
i do not know
he is a very sweet man
someone waiting for you
no one's waiting
there's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid is that our steven
if i am sleeping with him and i have not said i am then so what
so everything that is so what so i begin to hate him so i want to do him grave harm
but you do not even know me how can you care what i do with whom
i know you both enough how much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy
what come on paisley
he feels he has to defend himself if necessary
you have come to me i wanted to believe you would one day
i have not come to you
yes i have seen your victims one past and one future i thought i might convince you to reconsider
and i thought at last she is here she wants me
stay teach me to be compassionate
you gotta be kidding
all it takes is a long arm
hard to judge how these things happen the parole board almost never reverses their decisions
i guess it was because i was a model prisoner
you are back with your own people now got you some professionals
i get my own help
what about them
rudy butler frank jackson
sure  you are working on the passports   and visas
they will be ready you guys do your job
i will take care of my end
three rudy got ambitious
and you got him
what about your wife
you hired jackson and rudy not me
they may nail me into this now mccoy
that is your problem
you know you and i may be two of a kind
i am in a hurry
you still do not get the picture do you i have always heard what a smart ass operator you are
a simple reason mccoy the obvious reason to rob a bank
i knew that life did not add up to the obvious when i was 8
what do you add up to here
so we did that crackerbox to cover for you
the obvious  but we are both not interested in that right now
no  my old lady must have made a lot of promises
close but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings i pulled
we will try again
you okay
you want to drive
i am sorry i was late i got my hair done the girl was slow
where do you want to go
it does not look like that
what do you mean you have never been there
that is beynon got set up
where did you get those
i have been doing my homework
just like old times
better than old times
i hope so i am not looking forward to another stretch
i made a mistake i will never make another one
where did you get them developed
half a million
that beynongs got a long arm
what do you want for dinner
how does it taste
how is estelle
nothing's been boring since you found me

i guess i am kind of
it is all right
it is just been a while
i will be okay
how was it
i was going to fix you breakfast
you were asleep
yeah well i think i will stick with what i have got
$250000 right off the top

thanks again  i 'm glad you waited
i could not have much longer
yeah i know
that does not hurt
but sometimes i cried a lot too
i did not i just waited
 bank president three tellers and one guard
you know how i feel
promise you will not laugh
if it is funny i am going to laugh
i feel like the night before the first day of school
it will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more
waiting's hard you never learn how
you know i have actually gotten tired waiting sometimes worn out waiting
at least you were outside
i mean it
i know you do but it is different  it is different  we will be all right tomorrow
what about the bank
they checked in
there are three men dead
so what i have got to give him his money that was our end of the deal
he might be ready to chop us up
tell me about beynongs ranch
do you trust him
i just figure the percentages he would not try a cross until he is got the money
i do not want to go there
why did not you tell me
you sent me to him
when i got out why did not you tell me where it was
what the hell do you want mary tyler moore

texas is a big state
i can handle it
i will bet you can
when we had trouble before it was different
you do not like the way things are i do not like the way things

you have got all the answers what about when they find the body on the train
you have got it all figured
no there's a couple of things i am still working on
there may be a hunting party

you are full of ifs

why would he do that
to show me he does not have to talk to me if he does not want to
oh what is this some kind of staring contest between two kids from the old neighborhood
gerry any trouble finding the place
not at all
you are here quite a bit then
i live right around the corner
you moved
seems like it is going well
i think so
jobs doing what
cutting edge mathematics think tanks the kind of place where a mind like will's is given free reign
that is great gerry that there's interest but i am not sure he is ready for that
sean i really do not think you understand
you see sean that is exactly not the point no one remembers that they
i do
sean this is important and it is above personal rivalry
now wait a minute gerry
no no you hear me out sean this young man is a true prodigy
personal rivalry i am not getting back at you
this is a disaster i brought you in here to help me with this boy not to run him out
now wait a minute
and here i am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake
hold on
ready to falsify documents because you have given him license to walk away from this

oh starry night time huh
you ever heard the saying any port in a storm

well maybe that means you
maybe you should be a patient and sit down
maybe you married the wrong woman

we did a murder in ohio that is a crime but if this was like a suicide thing
like a suicide thing
adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion
you might think what i have done is shocking
to me though suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me
she missed myriad on a vocab test two weeks ago all right
i die knowing no one knew the real me
heather chandler is more popular than ever now
jason why do not you ask your little friend to stay for dinner

we have to talk  whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make
that is three things
i got a confession to make my name used to be heather too

i am looking for some perfume
any particular brand
well it is for a woman
wife girlfriend or mother
and the rent is okay
actually i have met someone there's a woman i think i like
i am  i am really feeling pretty good  i have a much stronger sense of how far i have come
as long as you keep remembering why
i understand that
and please do not for god's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way 
that would be stupid
that would be monumentally stupid all i am saying is 
 a sense of proportion
things are beginning to come to a head  i can feel it  and i want everything to be perfect
who does not
i have cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever
uasku her how she feels
i should
well can i make an appointment
oh great
yeah that was easy
do you do washing machines too
everything breaks at once
is not that always the way
i apologize for that scene with my husband  you must have overheard
an occupational hazard i am afraid
i bet  going into people's homes
do you have a family
uh no  i have never really found the time to settle down
i was driving by  i saw all the cars  are you all right
yeah i am okay  it is been a long night

hey  have a nice time  it is a good school
baby what is it
i am thirsty
it is the middle of the night sweetie
a man scared me
a man  was it a dream
why are you mad at each other
you know how sometimes neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him
uh huh
well that is what happens with grownups too
did daddy tease you
daddy's gone where rudolf went and is not coming back
so you do not have anything concrete
no i told you  a whiff of perfume on his shirt
have you just plain asked him
rita he is only twelve years old
c'mon kids let's go
why cannot you just drive me to my old school every morning
because you would have to get up at five am would you like that
i could take a cab on the way home
has anyone seen rudolf  i do not think he came in last night
thank god
the pocket's a cinch  i will sew it up for you after dinner okay
neil you could have burned the house down
where would he go
neil  what 
honey do you want some hot chocolate
no thanks mom  i will go up to bed now
do you want me to come up and tuck you in
neil calm down
neil do not leave the back doors open  i do not want holly near the pool
you are thinking exactly what i thought when i first saw this house
that is that
this  is  the  one  for  us
stop knowing me so well
i know it is at the high end of our range 
high end  honey it is a whole new budget
but it is what we want
you wanted furniture too did not you
you could have a pool to cool off in
it is a nice pool is not it
and it is a shorter commute
we are going to think about it
how were we  were we cool
paul newman in the hustler
he made you know a remark
honey are you okay
 and keep my kids away from his property  who the hell does he think he is  some nice neighborhood
how was your lunch with charlie
oh  great
well did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job
i hear things in this house
all new houses have noises
neil's still having a bad time at school  i feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time
i mean he is a smart kid he will get by  he takes after me you are too sensitive
no i am not kidding you uphilipu
barbara uzelmanu  i do not believe this
who told you that  someone on the radio
i thought we would be happy here
the cab's waiting
where should i hide the car keys
i do not know  put 'em in the drawer with all the chinese take away menus

oh god
should i come home when i am finished there
it is been on the market a while has not it
not very long  there have been a couple of bids already

sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment
this is a terrific entrance hall what a welcoming feeling
you will see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom
oh space   you said the right thing
how large is your brood
two  three if you count the husband
god your sister's really hot
let's follow 'em

who's that
the bartender at darrow's  he was there friday night
this murder was in the papers right
i could say the same thing about you
oh  we always have playoffs in the middle of the night  it is the best time
who's playing
she your only sibling
oh i should not have
it is okay  happened a long time ago  he was killed in a fire  in new mexico
then change it
how much closer would you say you were
i do not remember
duggar called him
it is legitimate
walter byrd killed kay connell  her things are in the house
i know
what about your shoulder
sorry about
i wish i would had the chance to get to know him better  take him fishing or something
he would have liked that
we just gotta catch the bastard right
that is why i am here  i need to know exactly what you saw yesterday farrell
what i saw
oh you know  do not feel that much bullet went right through
right  got lost in the rocks
no fibers skin flakes hairs
she left the party early  friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out
what time was that
who was the last one to see her alive
we are sure it is hers
what are you doing here
i will call him now
that is right
where you signed this
that is right
what happened at that signing
she flattered me about my writing  asked if she could visit me  to talk about my books
did she
she was not happy  i was someone to talk to
how do you mean
randy stetz
eight years
he knew exactly what we would be looking for made sure to cover up all his tracks
what do you want to talk about
we will talk when we get back to seattle
whengs that a week  two weeks  we have to figure out a plan of action now
you know my plan of action
to do nothing
he is asking everybody questions
but he is zeroing in on imei  on iusi everyone's talking about it
you know i remember that
one word to ia and he walks
maybe not  we could talk to buck
no way
well her mother did not buy them for her
i wish i could stick it out like you  i just with trish and the kids
i am thinking i could get off with probation  keep half my pension  that is all i want
goddammit hap  think about what you are doing
you do not have to be involved will
your friend's all business
fred duggar
no  he did not say what his name was only that you were expecting him
i am not expecting anyone
that is not what he thinks
what is it
you heard me that time
she loved me  she wanted to see me every night
i do not know what you are fucking talking about
what kind of stuff
just stuff  i do not fucking remember
the other guy
i told you i do not remember
after that she left the party to go to him
how should i know
ran like hell to go to him
i do not know
you do not know
thought i smelled something
i never met anyone from seattle before
you are not missing much
i was her best friend
best friend
since grade school
that is a long time
we were like sisters  knew everything about each other
you want me to take you somewhere
you and kay were like sisters
that is what i said
i do not know
you do not know
she would not tell me
it was like some big fucking secret
she used some stupid code name
what was it
no game
i am sorry
kay connell had a signed copy of one of your books
thought you might find that
down at the station
she was only seventeen
but she was an attractive girl
i suppose
but you wanted to
does not sound like a mentor to me
what about him
randy stetz is in jail
i thought maybe we could talk some more
there's nothing more to talk about
what the hell do you know
i told you that was an accident
then so was mine
do not you pull that shit with me
yes  like that
this an accident walter
where is your backup
no backup
you are not following procedure
wild card
yes and very beautiful
your lips they did not move
disappointing is not it to come so far and find so little jaded ingenues amusing themselves with make believe
we had feared we were the only ones
are you the leader of tis group
so you have the answers
ah you have questions
what are we
nothing if not vampires
who made us what we are
surely you know the one who made you
that is a picture nothing more
and perhaps this is the only real evil left
then god does not exist
i have not spoken to him
my god so it is as i always feared nothing leading to nothing
the one who made you should have told you this the one who left the old world for the new
he knew nothing he just did not care
i was waiting for you
claudia is dear to me my daughter
your lover
no my beloved my child
if you say so you are innocent
i am not innocent but i am afraid she feels she is in danger from the others
she is
we want no quarrel with him
it is already begun if you want to save her send her away
so soon without any of those answers you so longed for
that is what the one who made me said
are these not the answers you came for
lestat you knew lestat
where is she where is claudia
not without claudia where is she
i cannot save her
you cannot believe i would leave without her armand you must save her you have no choice
i could not prevent it
i do not believe you i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie
louis they cannot be brought back there are some things that are impossible even for me
you held sway over them they feared you you wanted it to happen
and yet you knew what i would o
i knew i rescued you did not i from the terrible dawn
you were their leader they trusted you
your melancholy eyes
what a pair we are we deserve each other do not we
why always on this night
what night what do you mean
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year
i did not realise
some of these are so old and tattered you should throw them away
i have or there would be twice as many
but you are the fairest by far
which of you did it which of you made me the way i am
what you are you would be something other than you are
and if i cut my hair again
you made us what we are did not you
stop her louis
why yours alone tell me how it was done
what is it now you irritate me your very presence irritates me
i suppose we could people the world with vampires the three of us
not you my dear
you are a liar but you upset my plans
stop pestering me then
oh lestat i must do more than that i have brought a present for you
oh claudia you have outdone yourself where did you find them
drunk on brandy wine a thimblefull i thought of you when i saw them
absinthe you gave then absinthe
do not louis 
louis put me in my coffin
i want more
how did you learn to write claudia
but you never let me see you kill louis
lestat taught you all you need to know about that
infant death he calls me sweet daughter death you know what he calls you merciful death
he jests
why does he call you that
claudia you did that
you want me to be a doll forever
claudia  do not 
we are immortal you have always known that
you see the old woman that will never happen to you you will never grow old you will never die
you both did it
but now's the time to end it louis now's the time to leave him
lestat oh god forgive us
he is dead claudia dead
should we burn him bury him what would he have liked louis
do not mock claudia
louis look at me
you never talked to me like that  in all these years
hush claudia hush now my dear 
what was that
it cannot be 
the ship is sailing wihout us
how do i look
you do not remember or you never knew
it was something hurriesand seldom savoured something acute that was quickly lost it was the pale shadow of killing
or her or her  or any of them
claudia you torture yourself
they are ducklings that will grow into swans whereas i must be the duckling forever
are they my kind louis dolls never change either
you know her
yes should i take her louis among her dolls make a doll of her in turn
but this cannot be real this is nonsense
mortals mortals everywhere and lots of drops to drink
they use no paint and the audience think it is paint
she is no vampire
this is no performance
this is monstrous
i have seen enough of this i loathe it
do you think i would let them harm you
no you would not louis danger hold you to me
that is not so
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word when he put me in that trance
so you felt it too
he can protect us claudia
your evil is that you cannot be evil and i will suffer for it no longer
she is dying it happened to you too but your child's mind cannot remember
but if she dies
bear me no ill will my love we are now even
they would have killed you 
then my luck would have changed
who the hell are you what are you doing in my house
you are not afraid of anything are you
you have to ask me for this you have to want it do you hear me
give it to me
vampires we thrive on blood
you let your overseer run riot work your slaves to the bone we will start with him
how do you mean start
let's call that a start
i cannot do it
you have just done it 
you are the devil are not you that is who you are
i wish i were but if i were what would i want with you
i cannot go through with it i tell you
your perfect your bitter and you are strong
but why do you want me
you really want to be with them
yes kill me kill me like you promised 
come you are going to feed now
take him
the crucifix 
what have i done
dear god what have i done
yes that is you my handsome friend and you will look that way till the stars fall from heaven
you must get into it it is the only safe place for you when the light comes
i know it gets cold so fast
have you ever been caught
but how do you know
read her thoughts
what have you done to me you have condemned me to hell
paris you came from paris
i learnt absolutely nothing i was not give a choice remember
they know about us they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses
come the new orleans then there's an opera on tonight a real french opera we can dine in splendour
i respect life do not you see for each and every human life i have respect
we belong in hell
what do you imagine you are louis
lestat she is alive
the girl lestat 
lestat  finish this 
my god to think you are all i have to learn from
oh god lestat i felt peace i felt an end to the craving
she is here your wounded one
what are you saying
you remember how you wanted her the taste of her 
i did not want to kill her
you are the devil you are the instrument of satan
your mama's left you with us she wants you to be happy
you are the devil you are the instrument of satan
claudia do not do this thing
no you come back to me louis
i am so glad you are here louis i have dreamed of your coming
do not try to speak it is alright
i did not mean to let them do it that santiago he tricked me
that is all past lestat
still beautiful louis you always were the strong one
do not fear me lestat i bring you no harm
and they frighten you
you know i love the dark but there's no dark anymore
it is false light lestat it cannot harm you
i have to go now lestat
you remember how i was louis the vampire lestat
you would have to have a lot of tape for my story i have had a very unusual life
so much the better i have got a pocket full of tapes
you followed me here did not you
saw you in the street outside you seemed interesting is this where you live
it is just a room
so shall we begin  what do yo do
well what a lucky break for me
you were going to kill me drink my blood
you believe this do not you that you are a vampire you really think
we cannot begin this way let me turn on the light
but i thought vampires did not like the light
you are not lying to me are you
you said the slave had a crucifix
oh that rumour about crosses
you cannot look at them
nonsense my friend i can look on anything i like and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes
the story about stakes through the heart
the same as you would say today bull shit
what about coffins
you loved yvette
can a vampire feel love
shall we go on
but why did you tell her
how could i not she had to know
and did you lose her did she go
did he die in the fire
no vampires in transylvania no count dracula
lestat escaped the fire
no it cannot end like that
you have not the vaguest conception under god of what you ask
what do you think she is madeleine a doll
and the child who did die

have you met charlotte my wife
i understand you saved my songs life today
god smiled upon us
and you were not hurt
no m'lady
m'lady if anyone sees it is death
if i do not kiss you i die anyway
i cannot bear to see you cry  what is wrong
i have never seen a sight more beautiful than you tonight
there were two  not one  but two
may i speak with you  alone
i am preparing for a ball
what is it mother
i wish to discuss your brother
i am king mother  and i do not wish to discuss this with you
he was my blood  and i demand to know what happened to him
why would you ask now  you never asked before
because i have dreamed of him  not as the baby they took away but as a man
it  it does not matter mother  he is dead now  dead
louis please  
what had you to do with this mother
he is your brother
no louis  no
your majesty
how goes that favor i asked of you
i grow closer to my target your majesty
wh wha
do not look so shocked phillippe come you are going back to prison
d'artagnan arrest them all
what do you propose to do
it can  i know the way
what are they doing
the prison of belle sur
what is that
a body
excellent athos  you have a keen sense of this man
you seek facts when it would be better to seek truth
switch  that is your plan  it is ludicrous
i have it all worked out
physical resemblance is but one small thing  louis has an arrogance a manner 
those can be adopted 
it is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours  it is phillippe's as well
how is he
resting he is had a long day aramis 
more wine
you must reconsider this plan phillippe is like a child he 
you can do it
in a year maybe two i could teach him enough to 
three days
phillippe  he is very bright he is perceptive but he is in such turmoil 
you grow fond of him  that is good
go on
but  what is porthos doing
now  you were saying
but  what is he doing
hang himself
he is threatened to do it it is been building up in him for months
we must stop him
come now athos if porthos is determined to end his life then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity
poor phillippe
the mask is terrifying especially when unexpected  do you notice
where are you going
paris  there is still much to do we will be back soon  be ready
remember phillippe nobility is born in the heart
bloody hell
he seeks redemption
so what has changed
then to the bastille
a simple theological discussion
aramis  the king wishes to see you
no  stop 
i will need you all  all for one one for all
i cannot betray louis  i will defend him with my life
pull them back d'artagnan
you cannot do it
pull them back
everyone back
once you are through do not stop until you reach the river
they will know you helped us if we go this way
please revel with me aramis i need my spirits lifted  i am old i am weak my strength is gone 
i observe your forgiveness is not sweeter than a plump nipple
aramis is this the way to hell
mother of god
it is also a place of burial
a tomb  we are in a tomb
and why are you so glum
aramis  athos  he looks exactly like exactly like
i do not understand  what does this have to do with  you carried a baby somewhere it is unusual but 
not just a baby porthos  i carried the child of the king
the child of the king is the king  louis
no not louis
athos do you understand this  he confuses me 
i carried the king's child  the queen had twins that night and one of them was sent away in secret
what use am i
we go someplace dangerous
let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there
aramis these are these are whores
so was mary magdalene and our lord loved her
he is going to kill you aramis
d'artagnan watches everything  we have to be lucky
can we eat before we go  this excitement's given me an appetite
d'artagnan  perhaps you should accept his offer for we are dead anyway
he gets one day of confession each year  today is the day
who does
what do we do now
d'artagnan unready
what choice is there  if phillippe is in the bastille then to the bastille we will go
you are right  but it is a trap
do i look all right
that must be raoul  raoul  look d'artagnangs come to visit that is wrong  you look awful
piglet    what are you  
never mind papa it does not matter now  she loved me once  i want to die remembering that
die  what
i have rejoined the army and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of general fromberge
fromberge  at the front  no
it is already done  i have just stopped at mother's grave to say goodbye before coming to tell you
thanks but not for me
you cannot drink with a friend you have not seen in months

you trust his character more than anyone else does
raoul is hurrying to the front so i must hurry too
athos please
get out of my way
where are you going
athos  i know life means nothing to you at this moment but i will not let you kill yourself
the king killed my son
it is honor you serve and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor
if you ever loved me  if you ever loved honor or anything else  then stand now and let it happen
he lies  he is here to trap us
the desire for vengeance can be a poison
you look so sad  is it something i have done

there is more to love than he knew or that you know
that is enough  you are a good servant d'artagnan but you forget your place
at least help raoul

order fromberge to keep him in safety  it is the least you can do to protect your own honor
i will consider it  now leave me

cowards  twenty run from four
magnificent valor
well yes of course majesty and i am sure they are content except that well they are starving
ah yes the riots  we have food stocks on the wharves right now no
that food has spoiled  that is why it was not shipped to the army
exactly why it should be given away
sire i 
sire  i  how did you 
from raoul  he urges you to guard your honor  as if it could be in any danger from your king
raoul is in love
the food does not please you
you would do that your majesty
you are beautiful  you know you are

susan listen to me  you handled that insect almost as much as siri

it is no use they know we are in here
they do not know anything peter they just sense they are hardwired

that is impossible  insects do not
what do you mean
that is the riddle
if i tell you then it is no fun
could you play arcade with that
we are having some problems with arcade
we vere thinking there might be tricks you know surprises that you would worked into the game
that is the question mark
level ten  that is where you have got to unlock arcade's heart using the keys you have found
well braindead anyway  coma patient it is really not all that important
the donor  maybe he is alive inside the game
nick alex how are we today
how would you know it was us
now what seems to be the problem
it is the game arcade
if this is a joke i am not laughing
neither are we  something's wrong with the game mr difford
talk to me
he thinks i am sublimating
has anyone seen greg
everybody's sick huh  it is fifteen after  we always meet here you know that
that is her problem
did you play arcade last night
liar  did you come from the city on the left or the city on the right
so where is he
so take his car home  wait  i am sure he is up to something
have you played the game yet  it is incredible  i was just
listen to me  greg never came home i think the game has something to do with it
i have to talk to you
we are talking
no in person  now
it is twelvethirty
what do you mean by weird
can you turn off the game
i am in the middle of it
so how did it know my name then
it turned itself back on nick
sorry  maybe i need the valium
something's happened to them
it is the middle of the night  they are asleep  phone did not wake them
because i did not know where else to go
we have to find out that is happened to them i think they are gone
no way
this is like a movie or something  i mean am i paranoid or what
it does not necessarily mean she is
then leave her
where do we go
it is growing  getting stronger maybe it is only localized now
but then it hits the relay stations
anywhere  we have to stop it from getting out
it is already out
then where do we go
you mean we learn the rules
and beat it at it is own game
you realize that in order to do that we would actually have to play the game
virgin sacrifices
what alex is trying to say is that it seems like it is alive
go outside get your car and meet me out front with the engine running and make it quick okay
what are you going to do
jesus christ
dante's inferno
what are you looking for
i do not understand  it wants us to play the game  it is been taunting us 
put in a quarter
it can turn itself on alex  it does not need a quarter
you are not coming alex
and what if something happens to you am i suppose to go in after you alone
i do not want anything to happen to you  i care about you
i already have a boyfriend nick
you feel it  it is different this time
okay  give us a kiss
one  in case
thanks  always wanted to do that
yeah well i figure these are unusual circumstances
i will take the lead and handle the physical threats  you watch the elapsed time and look for exits
which way do you think level two is
the clock's already ticking
and we have still got time left  this was a piece of cake
our time's up
what  there's nothing here
we cannot reach that
so that is what we almost died for
one of them anyway  did you see it  the screamer
christno time
we can take the dunes down like a ski slope pretend you are on a snowboard
what is it
i know
so tell me you are okay then
i am okay
come on  we will hit dante's after school try the game out maybe get some dinner
and then keep on driving
go for it
so how did you do it alex
then we will go home
which way
it is the wrong way
it is here
what did he do to you
is that your question
you have no time  what is your question
i am thinking
mom  you are alive
of course i am
but i do not understand
i love you alex  i never wanted to leave you know that do not you
isis that where we are  did i die
that is impossible

hi guys
hi kerry
i got your invitation yesterday thanks  any cute guys gonna be there
all of them
yor dad picking the music again
that is that
we are gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night
you are going out
we are going up to bed now
if i could get my hands on you
oh you could do nothing  i can save you much pain
leave her alone i tell you
we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery  let's turn back
no  it is on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind
but horror stories  why all the time horror stories
your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters but it certainly does not hurt your art of kissing
that is life  my kisses are alive
in there
it frightens me
silly there's nothing in there to be afraid of
thenthen that is that music
that is what i want to find out we have to get help
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night
something's making that music
i am not sure i care to find out what it is
all right  do not worry i will be right beside you
what help will that do if something in there is not dead
not dead  in a cemetery
cannot we get out of here
i am not sure
i am so frightened
you have got a right to be we are trapped by a bunch of fiends
those creatures
do not let them hear you
what can we do
easy shirley easy  panic will not do us any good  let me think we have got to stall for time
i am afraid i will faint
the ropes are coming loose
be careful
i amit is our only chance
i am frightened  i am so frightened
you do
yes i feel it in my bones
you are talking nonsense
oh no i am not  these heathens probably have an open grave for us
they would not dare put us in the same grave bor would theyb
i should hope not  i hate you
i still do not know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you
all right  put it on heavy
my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this  at least ihe isi got brains
ihimi  i will bet he sleeps with all the lights on
i love you bob i really do forgive me
there's nothing to forgive it was all a dream
you love me then
but they are not yet one of us
a situation easily remedied
and what is this
a symbol master
she came to us on the day of the dead
el dia de los muertosa celebration in her country
she was
as i said a worshipper of snakes and of smoke and flames
oh yes a religion of sorts
she pleases me  permit her to live in the world of the snakes 
now i will talkto the wolf manand the mummy
yes yes yes i know all that
at the first sight of the morning sungs rays we must be gone
i suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon
it would seem so master
at your discretionbut first i desire more entertainment
the moon is almost gone
ahh there is yet time
at the first sight of the morning's rays' light
i know the laws of the night i state there is still time for yet another
i understand master
then see that it does not happen again in the penalty of everlasting despair  now are there others
there are others
the moon sinks lower into the hills  we must hurry to the finish
i will decide the conclusion
you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session
then cancel my order
the bmoonb is almost bgoneb
there is yet time  do not you want your own pleasure
oh if there is only time
the timeis short
for what
your pleasures of course
you mean
you may take her now
is there time
you better hope there is
they are live ones
yes master
live ones where only the dead should be
have we in some way made you angry master
you know better than that
we do not know of anything master
then why do you shake so
it is not often an emperor like iyoui calls on creatures like us
there are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment master
ahh good  then i will see them  dismiss the rest
ahh the curiousity of youth on the road to ruin  may it ever be so adventurous
we had lots of snakes in my ancient egyptslimy slinky things
aahhhhnnnaaahahnn aaaaaahhhhooowwwoooooooooooooooooooooo
i could make her another cleopatra
ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn
cornelius if you have a moment today i would like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail
dr zaius 
did you forget our appointment cornelius
oh no sir i was just assembling my notes
you know dr maximus our commissioner for animal affairs
do not speak to me in absolutes the evidence is contestable
seal the cave
well taylor  we are all fugitives now
do you have any weapons
the best but we will not need them
you still do not believe me do you
nothing much the remnants of a life raft maybe a small flag the emblem of my countrymen
sorry taylor the terrain around that lake is poisonous there is no fresh water no vegetation nothing
where does the river lead
when are you going to show me that is in the cave
if there's any shooting dr zaius you will be the first to die depend on it
taylor you are not in command here put down that gun
taylor i would rather you 
yes i have to agree from all you have found so far his positiongs as good as yours
what are you doing there
they cannot convict us of that you proved our innocence besides   his culture is our culture
that is bright eyes the one i was telling you about
that is so special about him
look  she remembers
remembers what
the blood transfusion
it is a stunt humans do not write
dear you are a scientist do not you believe your own eyes
now just a minute 
 wouldodge was killed in the hunt what happened to landong  i do not know
flight is a scientific impossibility
cornelius why do you insist on provoking him
'then how do you account for me
i do not and i am not going to try
but what about your theory the existence of someone like taylor might prove it
zira are you trying to get my head cut off
do not be foolish if it is true they will have to accept it
cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis 
the evidence was very meager 
you did not think so then
'i am not a missing link'
because if he is a missing link it means the sacred scrolls are not worth their parchment
well maybe they are not
no thank you' i will not get into that battle
how did it go
we would better get started if the mounted police pick up our trail they will come this far at least
but how long is a day
nothing will grow here  there's just a trace of hydrocarbons and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates
which direction
that way
any particular reason
where there's one there's another and another and another
well at least they have not tried to bite us
will he live
but the quota system's been abolished you made it why cannot i
what do you mean made it i am an animal psychologist that is all we do not have any authority
you do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment
the foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here  in studies of cerebral function in these animals
objection the accused is indeed a man therefore he has no rights under ape law
there is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our faith
he can reason with the tribunal's permission let me expose this hoax by direct examination
that is true dr zaius my witnesses  correction  my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater
objection these remarks are profane and irrelevant
tell the court bright eyes  what is the second article of faith
i admit i know nothing of your culture
of course he does not know our culture  because he cannot think  tell us why all apes are created equal
good morning dr zira
good morning julius how is our patient today
you could get hurt doing that doctor
awww it still hurts does not it
he is trying to form words
what happened
those fools and their torches do you have any ointment
get me a collar and leash i am taking him to the infirmary
he is vicious doctor besides it is against the rules
landon send a last signal
what signal
it is no use  there she goes
landon join the expedition
sorry  i was thinking of stewart what d'you suppose happened
air leak died in her sleep
you do not seem very cut up about it
it is a little late for a wake she is been dead nearly a year
then we have been away from earth for eighteen months
long pause you know it
because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for  they are dust
prove it if we cannot get back it is still just a theory
if only we could get a fix
okay you read me well enough why cannot i read you
no cigar
she comes along too
zira does not want your female
i want her
if you insist but i am not taking any orders 
should not we be moving on
why did you do that scrape off your hair
sorry lucius you will have to stay here and guard the horses
always giving orders just like every other adult
all right all right will you do me a favor no orders
what is it
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner
they think you are behaving foolishly i must say i agree where will you go
i think you are making a mistake
i told you not to bring the other one
he would not leave her
gorilla hunters 
who put them up
the hunt club
what is that
yes sir but this  creature is a special case
why special
you asked for the opportunity to present your case surely you must know why you are here
dr zira  tell bright eyes to sit down
it says here that his name is bright eyes you gave him that name yourself
this hearing is absurd let me tell my story
one is in a museum
you destroyed his memory his mind his identity and you want to do the same to me
thats a lie
mind your tongue madame
this is a joke in very poor taste
welldo you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures
with one of them
i told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours
you lied where is your tribe
what about it
a fort unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent  where were you nurtured
i take it you do not believe the prosecutor's charge  that i am a monster created by dr zira
certainly not	you are a mutant
that is exactly what zira and cornelius claim you are talking heresy doctor
of course
all right suppose i am a mutant why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic
because you are not unique there was the one you call landon 
i do not know
if you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity
stop right there
there is no contradiction between faith and science true science
what is your proposal
when were the sacred scrolls written
of course
tell him to pull back
then there is another jungle
of course you could return with us our society might find a place for you and your mate
sure	in a cage
where else but in a cage does man belong
what evidence no weapons were found in the cave
well bright eyes is our throat feeling better
speak go on	speak again
my  name  is not  bright eyes it is taylor
i am not acting i can talk how much proof do you want
what is this
it is himlandon
which one
you  you knew about this
no i swear  i never saw this man before
actually you are a different breed this creature will never evolve
maybe not
you want her that much
that is the diagnosis doctor a touch of the sun
and that is your minister of science honor bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge
taylor please 
taylor tell him
then tell them dr zaius will not leave here alive
taylor please  do not treat him that way
why not
it is humiliating
would you like to come along
we cannot
dr zira i would like to kiss you goodbye
go with god taylor  that is an old expression it comes from both ape and man
he is moving his fingers
of course he saw you moving yours
would not it more properly be done in your office
dr zira  you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert
i do not state it sir the prisoner does
do you believe him
this is his assertion
how sad stuffed and mounted eh dead men like sunken ships can tell no stories and his other companion
he does not know
let them talk mr president let them talk
secondly if these 'tools' as you call them are unidentified why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything
but the proof the doll
no thanks i have seen seattle
same as an hour ago remember i am the steady type
you could tell me your name and where you are going
how far does this train go
vancouver bc
or reno  they always throw them off the bridge there i have heard
perhaps i do not take it so lightly
where are you staying in vancouver royal it is pretty crowded you know
is it i expected to go to the vancouver royal should i have a reservation
a very small service it does not even ask for thanks how long for
i do not know
nice room balcony and everything lovely view too
very nice mitchell turns
no thanks
thank you
suppose i had not known that immigration inspector had not put in a good word for you
dine and dance tonight i have got fifty bucks to throw away
not tonight
that is the matter
i am not in the mood for dining and dancing
we have some nice places around vancouver
i have not been invited
the brushoff huh
do not i even get my face slapped
would you mind
okay you win
if you change your mind about the cocktail party or anything else give me a buzz
betty this is margo west she wants to meet you miss mayfield
i think i would like to dance
please be a little more careful how you talk mr mitchell
i think you are drunk
that is the matter baby do not you like being kissed
good evening miss
how soon can i get a plane to seattle
i am afraid there's nothing more tonight miss unless you charter a plane
they might think i was running away from something
good morning can i do something for you
merely for our records miss mayfield it is usual for the guests who come here for the first time
you can have the table yourself if you would rather i am only killing time
no please
sit down then we often have a double up here
your liquor laws
a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here he is holding open house i was up there too noisy bored
i see
it might be worth a martini to you
i do not need it that badly i do not enjoy crashing other people's parties
it is openhouse no crashing involved anybody in the hotel's welcome
you do not sound as if you liked him very much
no not very well and i like his friends even less but  if you really want a good dry martini
as i said before
you are not paying for this it is quite enough that you let me sit at your table
i never pay for anything they just keep me here to amuse the guests
and do you amuse the guests
no  are you really going to drink that stuff
you are drinking it
i can be talked out of it as a matter of fact i would like a dry martini myself
would it make you anymore amusing
whatever you say
do you think i do not
thanks for the fresh air that felt good
you are sure mr brandon will not mind
i know it is a littler late for an apology
much too late
no and i have never fired a gun in my life are not you supposed not to touch it
they will know whether he killed himself
i do not
how did you meet him
on a train he said he lived here and he offered to make a reservation for me
nice of him
he knew the immigration officer he eased himself in
he was a great boy for that what else
go aheadif you want to it does not matter
you tried to run away
there was not any plane
want a spike in it
bad enough
he could hardly help suspecting you
what time is it
quarter after one why
dance tonight
let's not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us
certainly not to me
is this the best you can do
want to dance
dance here
why not
that man over there he was in the hotel lobby
i did not notice him
we walked right passed him he is following us
killaine's not that sort of guy he said nohe meant no
then he is got to be a detective
could not be
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby
absolutely sure
he is a fellow with a very hard knee and he knows how to use it
you do not know who he is
he is not a cop a cop would not have kneed me
no matter there's nothing i can do about it
anything i can do about it
take me homeand forget you ever saw me that is a silly remark is not it
it still does not matter if i kiss you
nothing matters
that is the second round i have lost tonight  that fellow hurt me
so have i
it sounds like a fair location could you be a little more exact
i am in the hudson bay company's store  that man last nightthe one that followed me
cant be too close for me  right across the street from it suits me  anything else listed
i hated to go to that place  i almost went to the police station instead
no percentage in that
they are going to arrest me
i know  killaine has a warrant
that was not why i called you  why did i hopewhen i had not any right to hope
how bad is it  bad enough for 
take me where i have not the courage to take myself
do you have to leave the note
i would still go througheven if i ended up in jail
you would not like it  i have been there
see anything
i can still see the shoreline the moon is rising
i decided i did not want a drinki am beginning to wonder
wonder what
if you are doing all this just for me
that and the fun of it
i thought you had to be back to the hotel  to leave mymy note
funny i never thought of you that way  you were so close too  we were all pretty stupid about you
including killaine
in a way
if it was an accident you could have told the truth
so could you  but our records were a little against us
no  i paid him off
he will come backthey always come back when you give them money
you will never make it  you have out smarted yourself
mitchell was dead enough
magruder does
i think you mean that
do you think i was faking
yes miss
i would like a dry martini very dry please
sorry miss beer and ale only canadian law
beer  well all right
beer or ale miss
ale i do not mind
mrs west is a very emotional woman
i was born in new york city i grew up and here i am
i will have to know a little more than that
please answer my question
you did not ask a question you made a speech
that is an evasion and you know it
who told you i was married
your family coat of arms mr killaine
regimental seaforth highlanders
i am sorry
stop saying you are sorry i want information not regrets
where is you get it
an unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that
why do not you arrest me and be done with it
care for a stroll outside beautiful morning the air is like wine the sky is a deep blue
deep blue i would call it greyblue
we would not have met at all
true i was a bit irritable last night i apologize
you were a galahad compared to some cops i have known
you have had dealings with the police before
who has notone way or another
but not in the investigation of a major crime i hope
you were there when i last saw him
i will find out you know perhaps not todayperhaps not tomorrow but in the end i will find out
the police always do do not they
youor the vancouver police department
you will not tell me who you are you will not even give me a chance to help you
nobody can help me you least of all
if i understand what you meant by that
you understand perfectly
then there is not much i can do is there
this is not a very good place to talk
i do not want to talk
i expected nothing else
i might be able to save you  if i knew enough
you would not even try  there must be some copper in you or you would not be an inspector
points very straight to her
he looks at the girl looks into her eyes
very ridiculous
that is my hard lucki am man enough to tell you about itand not be sorry
what do your friends call you the ones that know you welland like you very much
they call me jeff
looking for peanuts i suppose
so mitchell had handled it afterwards brandon picked it up  there's no indication you handled it
i always wear gloves when i shoot people  a bad jokebut better than tears
time's up  i am off the case 
they will only find someone else who will not be so kind
that is something i cannot spare you  but i will not do it myself
you have got a couple of hours maybe
to do what
i cannot answer that
what will they do to you
i know that
not sometimes  always  just because it is the hard way  you are that kind of man jeff
he could have killed me a dozen times  you would never have known
we know everything
no jeff  you do not  he is not a murderer i tell you  hes not a murderer
but i tell youif you would only understand
good morning mr brandon
morning any calls
mr reed would like you to call him
all right get him
and there's a mr goble to see you says his business is personal
i would like a few words with you in private
nice friendly approach you have got goble i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning
you asked for it
i am still asking what do you want
i am not sure i want anything from you you might want something from me
what have you got on miss mayfield
you hurt my feelings i ought to raise the price to be a thousand
if i call the police your price will go down to a minus sign
bluff you have waited too long
for five hundred what do i get
i go home and paint the kitchen
for two hundred
i stick around and wait for the five hundred
you mentioned information
sorry another client paid for that you can hire me not to use it
a thousand
got it on you
got the information on you
there's two hundred i will meet you in an hourwhere we met last night
why not here
i do not like your perfume in my office make it somewhere else if you do not like charlie's
hi margo hello killaine you two come together
and without much discrimination
leave that one lay
until he comes he is a nice guy you have met him
all right let's see the buzzer
that is a buzzer
so you are not a cop
me a cop what made you think that mr brandon
who told you my name
how are your teeth getting along
it goes with this cold houses and warm drinksthe effete englishman
that is what i like about cocktail parties everyone is so perfectly natural
how is life treating you
the usual grind
round of golf saturday
would it have helped if i would knocked him down
hardly who's the girl
somebody mitchell picked up on the train i do not even know her name
thank you
could be
it was lying where on the balcony
near his right hand about a foot away perhaps more good heavens one does not use a tape measure
how about a cup of coffee
in case you want to have us followed
i do not
time for a little chat
if it does not take too long  drink
thanks  lovely view you have have not you
could we discuss that some other time
sure  let's discuss betty mayfield  how long since you saw her
a couple of hours
i have a warrant for her arrest
would that make me a heel
you would be breaking the law
does not answer the question
the only answer i have for you
do not kid me  you do not think she murdered mitchell
it could have been an accident
that could be told
and old man clarendon  he had a motive too  margo and her money
mitchell was killed down here  how could clarendon get in to do it  or margo for that matter
how could mitchell  after that act he put on up here is it likely she would let him in
romeo in reverse  uhuh  no sale killaine
you do not buy it  okay  so i still want betty mayfield  where is she
no more for me thanks  remember what i said  i cannot interfere with the law
you forgetting the gag line killaine  the police do not take anything for granted
i am afraid they do  far too often so long
you do a lot of real estate trading brandon
now and then  mostly just for the fun of it
i tried it once  i lost my shirt
i buy my shirts by the dozen fortunately
you asked me where it all came from
hello mitchell having fun
that is the matter baby do not you like me anymore
do me a favor mitchell find yourself a nice secluded park bench
did i do something wrong
i would not know just do it somewhere else there is such a thing as good manners
how would you know brandon
want to walk out or get thrown out
you do not throw guests out brandon
good afternoon mr campbell
mr mitchell
a little something on account perhaps
rather more than a little something mr mitchell
i think we would better discuss this in my office mr mitchell
i am getting positively haggard in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair
what are you doing here
i do not think you locked your door
do not be a fool i loved him he was not worth it but i loved him
and now that he is safe from all other women you can go on loving him
you nasty sardonic
that is not enough
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun you lied it was obvious
he saw my face too
so he didbut he has not told you what he saw i have
they will arrest that girl everything points to her
mr clarendon have you ever seen this before
i am sorry inspector i do not know much about
recently then
no not recently i am sure of that
i need not keep you any longer mr clarendon
not a floater  only just dead
you are the waterfront specialist find out about it  i have got a murder to investigate
you have two murders to investigate this mangs head was beaten in and there's nothing in his pockets
got a moment inspector
i have got a year  or a second i am not sure which
swimming with his hat on  that is original
if you would seen the blood on his headand some body had to carry him out to sea
i understand  pity to mess up a nice clean boat
send that
catch me at the vancouver royal if it is important
thanks inspector  what are your orders about this wire to san francisco
i am looking for mr brandon
i have an appointment with him right here right now
go live in a tent
it will be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet
mr brandon could not be here  he might have left something for you what would it look like
one of those nice long manila envelopessealed  not too fat not too thin
what do i get for it
you get it is brother
i need a receipt  sign your name across the flap
open it and count it
you in charge here
i knew him he was easy to dislike poor chap
 i supposed you knew her too inspector
pearlhandled 25 automatic uh  no it is a belgian gun 66 mm
so the shell ought to have gone over
unless the gun was slanted up
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer
right a clean deduction from observed facts they have got to be simple once in a while inspector
i will know when i find it
that is pretty risky business inspector
not too hard is it
maybe we have been pretty dumb
was that about the right angle
i think so
where is the shell
do i know who lives down there
you can find out
do i know that she is out of the room  likely to be out of it for some time
you can find out the first part the second part you have to take a chance on
pretty big chance huh
this is the shell  what about the gun
no suicide
oh the coldstream guards  do not you take your hat off in elevators
may you what
oh nothing
scotch and plain water i think
what about me
i shall from your knowledge of mitchell would you say he would be likely to commit suicide
anybody could commit suicide if he felt low enough i have felt it myself
remember that time did not i good morning mrs west  does your visit here mean you have changed your mind
how did you know  clarendon  you cops never tell anybody anything do you
other people always know so much more than we knowso much more than they are willing to tell us
you could not possible have traced it this soonnot possibly
of course not  thanks for telling me  i have not seen mr clarendon
i am a fool
you did not play it for laughs last night
did you ever have a serious operation
not if it clears the air
it does  may i go now 
i will investigate mr clarendongs financial position
i do not understand
perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems
i am interested in who handled it
no doubt about that one
how about magruder
he checks too
that leaves two strangers
so far
try betty mayfield  the mitchell case
mayfield  she fit into this
this gun permit was issued to clark brandon
the card says so does not it
killaine this is mr mitchell senior  young mitchell's father he just flew in from toronto
i have explained the situation to mr mitchell up to a point  now about this mayfield girl
i hear she is a very pretty girl
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment
are you a policeman or a softheaded nincompoop
a little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either
it will not look pretty good on your record killaine  where is the girl now
i do not know sir
well find out  who's covering her
ye have have ye
we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfield's toilet articles  washington ought to teletype us within a few hours
and in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases does what she pleases
i think you would be entirely justified sir
but you still think she is innocent
get out of here
what are my orders sir
i am afraid you are not very glad to see me margo
who's the girl
she is just a girl i met on the train you do not mind do you
why should i mind
you should not you washed me up very thoroughly
as thoroughly as i could it was not easy but you are helping me
margo darling you washed me up remember we are just friends you wanted it that way
she is very beautiful she is much younger than i am and she is rich i hope
rich i have not the faintest idea why
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared i was not lucky
you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police
i have a rough idea
you would go to jail for a long term
i have always been a heel i guess i always will be
you do not have to make a pose of it
it is the only pose i have left i am sunk broke i do not even have my hotel bill
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself
that is not very kind
that is this
what does it look like
how long have you had it
you already have the checks darling
i did not mean it that way  i am sorry
oh forget it clark brandongs throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening take me
of course
how about your new friend
i told you she is just
i am sorry i forgot about calling for you
it is quite unimportant mr mitchell after all you got what you wanted
be nasty
i have no intension of being nasty mr mitchell
she is beautiful and young  no thank you
you are very attractive my dear and you look very unsophisticated
what do you mean
strange major there was a firefight shooting in all directions
i cannot believe jim hopper walked into an ambush
i do not believe he did sir i could not find a single track just does not make sense

what did i do
you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play

i would love to hear it
in the shadow by those two trees
what the hell's the matter with you jackson
sir i ai not feeling so chipper on account of wade
sir i understand  i do not like it but i understand
not yet

it is worth it
no whitewalls sir there's a war on  not there you goddamned idiot over there  i cannot help you sir
a halftrack anything
a paratrooper named ryan  he is going home if he is alive
senator's son
i know about bracketing  i read about it  the next one is going to land right on us
sir i am sorry about what happened i
it was nothing
but you could have gotten killed and i
i was not made for this
it looks like a renoir
yes  do you know sibelius' fourth symphony the normandy
i have been humming it
i heard
it seemed appropriate
if that is the way you feel why do not we wait until it is up to a thousand
no but he heard firing just east less that a kilometer
what is it
good luck captain
do not need it i am a cat i have got five lives
i wonder where they are going
i would like to stay too captain
i can tell what the gunners had for dinner
what about our grenades
those are tigers they have sixinch armor they do not even notice grenades
would they notice and eightyeight
sure you got one
but sir
there you go again that is whining that is not okay
what would you say captain
captain what about our deal
captain if your mother saw you do that she would be very upset
worked did not it
you trying to get yourself killed
i wish  you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission
you  leading a squad
some private up there lost three brothers got a ticket home
simpson  jesus christ on a fucking pogo stick

beasley's dead
okay wade  translators
fresh out

he is right captain it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys
it is not normal not reading letters from home
since when have things been normal
you think they will be alright
they are fine  as long as they can gripe they will be alright
three for three
if we stayed we could make a difference
you are kidding yourself
i hope this boy ryan is worth it
now you are the one kidding yourself  hell of  a mission
makes you feel small does not it
a couple of weeks  it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for loading
is it getting worse
yeah  what rule of thumb is that
how about i go right sir
how about
pulls wade's hands from the wound pours sulfa powder
shoves the needle into wade's neck thick vein  pumps the morphine straight to wade's brain  motions impatiently to sarge
more morphine hurry up come on come on
hesitates  then drops his sulfa fumbles in his pack  finds the morphine
you alright
you know why i am such a good officer because of my mother  have i ever told you about her
it could be worse  you know the first thing they teach you at ocs lie to your men
john i have got to tell you i think you are about used up
i think you are right keith
no but if i get any worse you will have to relieve me
you know wade was the eleventh of the twelve you are the last one still alive
thanks for drawing that machine gun off me
sarge see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable
what are we going to do
uh oh
reiben i do not know what i would do without you  sarge keep ryan close to you and alive
captain can i put in for a transfer
i do not think so captain
sorry i need a bar man you are the best
no i am not kaback is honest  or what about faulkner  or that little guy with the glasses
trust me you are the best
captain can i ask you a question
sure reiben
captain i gotta tell you the irony of this mission is fucking killing me
there's always a bright side
i am listening sir
general gavin is going to be very irritated at you captain
jesus christ he is a natural
captain could you please explain the math of this mission to me
i would much rather die in caen than ramelle sir  it is a personal thing
reiben there's a fairly good chance you are not going to die at all
well maybe not the captain but the rest of us have mothers
sir i have got an idea let's go around
up  we are moving out
i thought you said we had an hour sir
has anyone ever told you you are officer material
no sir
scans the germans with his binoculars
looks like they have been having a hell of a party here captain
i have no fucking idea  here we come  cover me
what if our guys open up sir
you are only allowed to shoot at germans that is one of the rules
leave him to me captain i will have him pissing and moaning with the best of us
cocks his thompson  settles down behind some sandbags
here they come
goddamn itgoddamn itgoddamn it
what deal
i wonder if his cabin is still available
hears the faint distant rumble of the tank  barely has time to react sees
here they come
fires a burst  germans drops
continues firing  cutting down the advancing germans
private  i am sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed is not going to help
sir if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up our guys are going to be sitting ducks
thank you sir
yes sir
i would like to go sir
do not do that again
you set  sarge nods
is jumped on by one  upham fires kills the german
does not move  he just stares at sarge's body
fires the eightyeight
yes private
upham and jackson what were they like
and sarge
that is because as i have pointed out on numerous occasions you are a happy idiot
reiben you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes
you want unpleasant  just wait i can do much better than this
wade's right it is some kind of scientific magnetic thing i cannot explain it but i have seen it
hell i do not mind this mission sir as long as there's something up at ramelle for
shit sir
fertilizer captain i think we are in a cranberry bog
who cares
i usually like surprises
damn fool  sir
jesus reiben think of the poor bastard's mother
so where are you from
but everybody's heard of him he won the congressional medal of honor he saved a dozen men
we know
sir i ran the 220 in high school
on guard glancing back  pissed off
goddamn itgoddamn itgoddamn it
i do not know i kind of like wade's idea about the cruise ship  i have never been to tahiti
how do you do it
you think he really believed it
give it to me
how is that
that is not necessary  you are in
thank you
you do not  it goes to court now
he is pissing in our faces again and we are just taking it
how is it working for a scumbag like this you proud of yourself
what do you think
announcing what
there are seven deadly sins  gluttony wrath greed
so what  this victim
that is this i am declining this case  it do not work that way
you have left unfinished business before
have you heard
no i have not heard
it is none of my business anymore
i thought you might want to be filled in
come on  what are you going to do with yourself out there
i will get a job maybe on a farm  i will work on the house
cannot you feel it yet  cannot you feel that feeling   you are not going to be a cop anymore
what are you talking about
i heard
i have no understanding of this place anymore
well there he sits  it is not supposed to make sense
how you feeling
they are hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go but i told them not to expect it
he is being arraigned tomorrow
i guess decide for yourself  i do not know what it says  i am going to go
where was the girl
what  what
she was she was on the bed  she was just sitting on the bed
jesus christ man do not shoot me
turn around  hands on your head
what the hell's going on
who are you  what are you doing out here
this guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here  he wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock
what do you mean
that is so exciting
it is surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct
david please
give me the gun
where we headed
what makes you so special that people should pay attention
you know that is not true
a woman
delusions of grandeur
you should be thanking me
i seem to remember knocking on your door
and i remember breaking your nose  you are only alive because i did not kill you
just keep leading the way
i wish i could have been a normal man like you  i wish i could have a simple life
you have made a good life for yourself
here he comes
what the fuck is going on
i need to start getting the feel of it all right  meet the people
i meant to ask you something mills when we spoke on the phone  i cannot help wondering why here
i i do not follow
you just met me
i was not standing around guarding the local taco bell  i have worked homicide for five and a half years
not here
i realize that
drop it
who said this was murder
it is a bucket of vomit
is there any blood in it
you think it was poison
is that clear
okay sure  it is just that with my old partner you know
same color and texture
it could be nothing
this is his stuff  i have been out in the cold all day
i am declining this case  i want us reassigned
it is too soon for him
it is a package deal  you get the phone with the office
i am invited to have a late supper at your house  and i accept
all television does is teach children that it is really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day
what about sports
you go to movies at least
i read  remember reading
you have never seen the odd couple  this is sick  the honeymooners
our guy got into office probably before the building closed and security tightened up  gould must have been working late
he must have left another puzzle piece
look i appreciate being able to talk this out but uh
and if it is a threat
like in the parsongs tale and dante
seven terraces of purgation
forced what
attrition  when you regret your sins but not because you love god
no witnesses of any kind
this is the one thing
you are sure your men did not move this
what the fuck is that
there must be something
oh yeah sure  you got to be kidding
he just may be nuts enough
and you do not
i wish i still thought like you
does this make it with you
does not seem like our man does it
the fingerprints
yes  they were there so it must be
why would we
it is victor
i want him bad  i do not just want to catch him anymore  i want to hurt him
listen to me  he is all about playing games
i do not know about you but i feed off my emotions
how do those cockroaches get here so quick
they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well
sorry about that i just
a landlord's dream tenant a paralyzed man with no tongue
i am sick of sitting around waiting for him to kill again
it is too dismissive to call him a lunatic we cannot make that mistake
oh blah blah blah  the guy's insane
we do not know for sure
and so what
well he is been right so far has not he
how much money do you have
well that was money well spent
for a long time the fbi's been hooked into the library system keeping accurate records
you got to be kidding
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable communism to violent crime
how is this legal
yeah  some college student who's taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime
yeah well at least we are out of the office  we have got pizza
how do you know all about this
this is a waste of time
we are focusing
i know i know focusing on one little thing
modern homicide investigation  in cold blood  of human bondage  human bondage
it is not what you think it is
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism
that is
the writings of saint thomas aqu aquin
you are sure you are reading that right john doe
that is what it says  jonathan doe
this is stupid  it would be just too easy
what are you going to say
you do the talking  put that old silver tongue of yours to work
are you alright
i am fine
wait just wait
it was him
the hell i cannot  we get in there and we can stop him
we need a warrant
think about it
what the fuck is wrong with you
you stupid son of a
what are you talking about
we could use about fifty more men here
he is preaching
you know there's not going to be a happy ending to this  it is not possible anymore
if we get him i will be happy enough
no  face it now  stop thinking it is good guys against bad guys
you do your job
where is the victory
people do not want a champion  they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers
he cut her up and dressed the wounds
you knew i would say yes
as soon as this is over i am gone
because he is john doe by choice
you know he is fucking us
you and i are probably for the first time ever in total agreement  he would not just stop
if john doe's head splits open and a ufo flies out i want you to have expected it
what is it
kiss me on the lips
throw your gun down now
throw your weapon detective  now
tell me it is not true
put your gun down
do not do this please
i am sorry about this mrs gould  i really am

i  her letter came to me by the nurse
your aunt
yes my aunt but perhaps she wept a little tell me how you love her will
and her lips
oh thomas her lips the early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy
and her voice like lark song
deeper softer none of your twittering larks i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song
she sings too
constantly without doubt and plays the lute she has a natural ear and her bosomdid i mention her bosom
what of her bosom
but what of lord wessex
ohit isit isoh it is a house of ill repute
here we come at last my lord

is there a man
a man my lord
there was a man poeta theatre poet i hearddoes he come to the house
a theatre poet
an insolent pennyapage rogue marlowe he said christopher marlowehas he been to the house
marlowe oh yes he is the one lovely waistcoat shame about the poetry
you upstart inky pup now i will show you your place which is in hell
you are on my ground
that is his name
all right just a few questions
do a little freebasemaybe from time to time
i was trying to educate you
just serve
chess chess is often used as well
will you shut up and play
you are a bad loser
victory is the same as defeat it is giving in to destructive competitive urges
you learn that in your psychotherapy group
what do you think
about what
about this guy this hugo person
i do not have time
he made it clear
only on expenses
have you seen him
alex i do not have the time 
you mean immoral
i am only asking you both to think about it
he is still here
he could not get his car started
when are you going to let the police know
you call them if you want
so who's going to do it
dig the pit i do not know
no not that
then what who's going to do what
you know what i am talking about
do i what what what are you talking about
i cannot do it
i do not hear this
family family friends druggedup wandering suicidal search of the self fuckups do not have families david
i just thought we should discuss it
but not quite
do not you worry about that
is this necessary
that was good
can we talk about something
listen it is important we need to talk about what we are going to do 
that is the problem
i want to talk now
good luck i love that guy but why does he have to follow us around
how much did you pay
i do not know
how much did you pay
i do not know
how much
from what jehovah's witnesses
there was a breakin
that is all this for more security
i fitted a lock up there on the inside
what yes that is fine
you are sure there's lots more
no i am sure that will be enough
you are not eating
not eating what
not eating like you used to that is what
you looking for me
looking for you yes
what for what did you want the money was that it
your friends
i am glad you are so certain alex it makes us feel a whole lot better
but they know
they can know all they like it will not do them the slightest bit of good 
they know
they know so what they have nothing there is nothing to connect us to that bodies stuff
sex lines is that it triple xrated interactive fantasy old habits die hard
yeah i was phoning your mother
you old devil well anyway as you can see we are leaving
so i gathered
yeah i am sorry but that is the way it is
oh no no no do not let it worry you not at all it is probably for the best
for the best exactly i would not want things to end on a downer
not at all
no cannot think of anything else that matters
about the mail 
it is very kind of you to offer but 
where do you think you will go
out in the woods three bodies decomposed mutilated beyond recognition
but there's no 
animals involved i know but you need a change and besides we are short
i do not know
is this being recorded
this is just an informal discussion
are you recording it
what does it look like
it looks like he is writing everything down
that is because he is does that upset you
no why should it
well then
i have never seen any of these men before
take another look at these two
i do not know them
and if i told you their car was parked outside would that surprise you
parked outside
that is it then
that is all
sorry to waste your time
oh no problems do not worry
well cameron are you comfortable
yes thanks
and you like it
oh yes it is great
spacious quiet bright well appointed all that sort of stuff all that crap
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands do you then summon hellfire
did you know 
i thought you stopped going
maybe you should go alexyou will meet someone wonderful
for my life at a discussion group i think not
she hated you 
well she had problems 
has he tried down the back of the fridge i mean that is where i normally find things
who was it
i am not usually drunk
in a moment he is going to tell he could have been someone 
it was you juliet it was you 
 instead of what he is 
what i am
 which is 
 which is a hack
the man we know and love
a miserable burntout empty shell of a  alex pauses looks at his drink then at juliet
i think you are lying
you are right
you see they do not really know me
have you seen hugo
david has not seen him either
so i gathered
his car's still there
he is got a car
so that is wrong with that
what sort of car
alex how shouldi know i am just a girl
i will ask you once more what sort of car 
open it
i wonder how he did it
did what
what that is wrong
what are you doing
i am just looking
do not
why not that is wrong juliet are not you curious do not you wonder what he died from
nothe guy's deadwhat more do you need
it is not every day i find a story in my own flat
thats not a story alex it is a corpse
who's going to do it
i thought we all were
i do not thinki can
but you are a doctor you kill people every day
i do not want to it is different
love and happiness for ever
david i promise we will keep him happy
cameron you remember cameron
no i do not
that is he doing here
that is not him
well you certainly had a good look around
hello hello
will you calm down
is this the same stuff you made last week
no no it is different
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff
you know you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it that is my advice
once it is spent you will not have to worry about it
be like a weight off your shoulders
you know we are right
leave him alone
he cannot stay up there
he will come down leave him alone
yeah he is got to go to work has not he you think he will come down for that
no but he is looking after the money so that is the problem
boy am i glad to see you
what are you doing here
we have to talk
exactly now i have been thinking 
oh good
he will not do anything for me but for you 
and the money
we could put it somewhere
where he cannot get it
now you thought of that not me
are not you going to answer it
no definitely not and that is that i refuse to discuss it further
it is the only way
i refuse
you will wait in the hall
i will wait there
are you all right
i do not know i thought maybe i was 
of course but i think you will find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed 
it makes us feel a whole lot better
it is about me and david
the perfect couple i should say
you must not take it so badly
do not worry about it i would do exactly the same but i do not think i am his type
stop him alex you have got to stop him
i see
it is ok there's no problem
you mean i can have the room
what about
of course
did you hear anything before he cries
no not that i recall i was asleep
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days
no nothing sorry
well if you do you will let us know
of course
and the other three people on the flat did they hear anything
who said there were four
we understood there were four people living here not always of course but now four
no three who said there were four
how strange and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information only three people here you are sure
i see
i doubt it and these two other people did they hear anything
no they were asleep they did not even wake up
yes why do you think you woke and they did not
loks like you had a breakin up here as well
is this where no one stays
no i have never seen them
why do you want a room here
just get on with it alex
i have never seen a dead body before
are you all right
oh yes i am fine thanks just fine
do you know many of these people
do you think you could be a little more forceful next time
i am sorry
it is alright i think he got the message anyway
two hundred
two hundred pounds
two hundred pounds
you paid two hundred pounds for this
visitors some friends maybe someone you talked to
no one i promise
who have you talked to
no one

 inauguration balls 
 opening of the opera 
 riding to hounds 
you are very kind  i will bet you are also very gentle  and helpless 
i beg your pardon

oh i am not going to let this one get away he is so cute  collects shells
anyway you are going to meet him tonight
i am
i guess he is not going to show up  it is give minutes to one  you suppose he forgot
well you know how those millionaires are  these came for you

oh it is not that it is just that i am  harmless
harmless  how
well i do not know how to put it  but i have this thing about girls

it is more like a mental block  when i am with girls it does nothing to me
have you tried

nothing at all
complete washout
what happened
i do not want to bore you
talk about sad
ever since then   numb  no feelings  like my heart was shot full of novocaine
you poor poor boy
yes  all the money in the world  but what good is it  mint sauce or cranberries
how can you think about food at a time like this
what else is there for me 
is that anything
do not talk like that  i am sure there must be some girl some place that could 
would you do me a favor
anything this time
i am afraid not  terribly sorry
you are not giving yourself a chance do not fight it  relax 
it is like smoking without inhaling

why would you help me
dad this is ridiculous just open it

how do you want it  the eggs
uhover easy

i came here to have a word with your dad
will not your father help you with that
this is a vicious cycle
i think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do
is not this technically a scooter
when i am on my bike i feel like a wild person  better than any sex i have ever had
kinda tough on the butt
everything has it is drawbacks
where did your brother escape from
the mental hospital
mind if i cut in
you and your sideburns are the talk of the party theo
the ladies in akron call them thigh ticklers
can i ask you something personal
i would rather you did not
do you have a girlfriend
not while i am in training
do you have a boyfriend
no do you
unfortunately what he wants is you
so what about you
do i want you
theo what would you do if you could not bowl
no i am fascinated
why were you suspended
i used to be kind of wild they used to call me the bad boy of bowling
so you are hoping buzz can get you re instated
well that was plan a
that is plan b
plan b is your dad
what do you think my dad's gonna do for you
he said he would sponsor me
oh really nothing my dad does not do anything unless there's something in it for him
sheila please
come on theo what about plan c
that is plan c
i do not think your new outfit suits you theo
do you talk with your mom
it is been awhile she did not want me looking for my dad
my mom told me not to stay in this town
i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers
yeah but they are all little wannabes i am looking for a professional man
i may not be a pro bowler but i am no amateur man sheila moves closer to theo
how much would you charge me for the lips
more than you could afford
come on bargain with me
what are you going to do about your brother
you are here
then it is true is not it about
it would not bother you if buzz was in danger would it
nope i could not care less
i am sure you would not care if he needed your help right
why should i help that old fuck
and besides it is probably too late anyhow
too late for what sheila
you know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming
you got any broken bones
i cannot tell you theo
tell me sheila what are you afraid of sheila shakes her head
i am afraid you will hurt him
it is junior is not it
i cannot  i cannot do it  he is my brother
you do not have to do this we could just cut out of here go to akron  or anywhere else
i told him you were my boyfriend
what the hell did you go doing that for sheila we have not even gotten naked yet
how do you get this thing down
you wanted me to kill him did not you
if he is not dead he will keep coming back
he is dead sheila
i feel sick
you should
are you sure he is dead
where are you going
i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz he gets into his car
if junior finds us he will kill us both
i killed him once i will just have to kill him again
you do not get two chances with junior
theo buzz is dead
i did not come this far to bury a guy that is not my dad he owes me
back to plan a the vicious cycle all over again theo lets go of sheila
my word is good and it will always be good when did i ever give my word to you
what about plan c
fuck plan c
your word is so good you are never gonna give it to anyone
you think i am dumping you to get back into bowling well who's dumping who
i am not dumping you i am suspending you

i am a professional man
lips still for sale
you bet for five bucks i will even throw in the tongue

we are from different worlds
all this talk about love it is silly
of course i do not hate you i  do not hate anyone

it is paradise  we could be very happy here
but i have to go back i brought you here so you would be safe from her
she said it would not last

you look at them how
that horrible woman
zaltar please help me

there's no way out of the zone no one's ever escaped that is why they send the criminals here
if there's a way in there must be a way out
there is a way
i knew it
then come with me
leave the zone what would i do on earth
you could do anything you could sculpt mountain rangesdraw with rainbows you would have superpowers
you are going to take me back
you can use the wand

do not stop keep moving
yes must not stop
zaltar use the wand

but it is too late  i got him back the job
well he is got her in a tizzy i will tell you that
sure he steams her up  wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz
and who's feet is she on now
presumably yours  that is according to st dallas
that is this boy got that susie likes
integrity  acute like indigestion
do not go wild sidney
but not for anything i did today
are you listening
talk to her sidney

i knowi know you are the strongest cop in town
that is all the rush  you said three o'clock
it is nice sidney that you give me this tip
he goes out with girls
well i will be darned  and what does jj think he should do
i thought he would
that is a question i usually like to ask you  your secretary phoned
what about
could this be that boy
bribing me again
that is your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates
i do not think so
you are sure  find out for me
is frank d'angelo around
do not tell me you started a polka with leo bartha
avidly  he was staring
staring  consequently when he approached me on his way out i was not surprised but i did not let on
he was writing a special sunday piece on
cigarette girls and naturally 
you were thrilled to be interviewed  were you interviewed
in his apartment 
do you think you could do something sidney
do you still keep your key under the mat
do not you know who that man is
and he is a perfect stranger to me
what do you want all of a sudden  lady godiva  where is my other shoe
sidneyii do not do this sort of thing
what sort of thing
a girl needs a little romancing before she 
next time i will call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling
what would you think of me if 
nothing i did not think of you before
that is the third time he is called today
but what
that makes five days in a row that mr hunsecker's cut you out of his column
who else phoned
the renting agent and the tailor
pay the rent  let the tailor wait
i wish i could help in some way sidney
go home sally  it is late
sidney i know you by now  do not do a dance with me
you mean you do not want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world
so what will you do if i feel nervous you will open your meaty sympathetic arms
you ought to be used to me by now
if that is for me tear it up
take a top coat
i put a lotta trust in you chickie
i know you do sidney
i swear sidney i cannot help it  sometimes i wonder what i see in you
that is no way to talk
or what you see in me for that matter

did you now  on which bounce

that is why we are here
not really
do not tell me boston is different from new york
i love this house  i really love this house
a monster  but he built this for the woman he loved like the taj mahal

good night theo
if this was some sort of joke i am going to kill him
yes  i feel realy rested too theo
how could he have left without his keys

theo did you
that is so sad
there's hundreds of them  this must be a record of the children who died at the mills like luke said
i do not know what to think anymore
i will take that as a compliment  in the city what kind of place do you live in
you want to move to new york you want to move in with me
are you sure
nell what happened
nell it makes sense  it all makes sense  you and i we were scaring each other working each other up
i am going to stay with you until you fall asleep  and then i am going to get some brandy
i do not think i want any
they are all in here  all the ones he killed  they are just children we have to help them

i uwantu to know why you uneedu that scary guy in your house
gordon  he is been with me for years he is not as tough as he looks
then what good is he
is it possible that you are too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty
is that a problem
not for you clearly
i am loyal to things that make me happy
am i a thing
well you are certainly not a person
i am not
no  you are not specific enough to be a person  you are more like a vibe
i am so glad we are having this chat
it is not a knock
it is not a compliment
it is an observation  like  i am hungry when are we eating
as soon as you get dressed
what kind of food
i am not into finger foods  too fussy
like you
i do not like doityourself cuisine buffets  salad bars
you demand to be served  a fork fetishist
it is just fuel to me  i am not there for distractions
for some eating is a sensual experience utheu sensual experience
that is what gordongs always saying
i like the colors
we all did
hey i thought you were not a buffet person
i have lived in la all my life i have never done this drive
that is the matter
nothing  i guess it is hard to pass on this road
the freeway's faster but lacks a certain majesty
just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time
we think someone is here
we think
how they going kid
not bad
same as last time  the rest after
where do we go
when you find the guy you will know
there's been some trouble downtown
what kind
what the papers used to call a gangland slaying
our black friends
no terry  they do not work like that jenny wilsongs father paid a little visit left a message
you should have let me do the talking
why because you are my security consultant  this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down
i mean gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds
heavier than that now  but are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story
as it happens  i did not make that part up
and where is this guest  do not they want to interview him
where do uyouu think he is mike
we will find him

something like that yeah
i already knew  knew beforehand  when was it supposed to have happened  two o'clock in the morning eddie said

based in london but with international concerns
i bet
various enterprises style of thing
i thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life
in what capacity are you employed by this mr lindgren
this and that  y'know  ways and means
so that is the deal  you and terry valentine at twenty paces  is that what this is about
why not
are you serious
you fucking guys and your dicks
what would you want me to do  stay at home twiddling me thumbs  doing sweet fa [fuck all]
you do not believe it was a car accident
what do you think
terry's never going to give you satisfaction  not the type
depends dong it
on what  what makes you so certain
i will bloody well ask him
how did you come to have my address found it did you  among her things
you think terry gave me access to her things  probably sold her clothes
early 70's  i was away  maidstone  possibly brixton
you do not seem bothered
you do not know how i have compromised my standards
oh i was gonna say 
still there have been rewards  it is sunny  and some of the producers who call even have credits

yeah  should not wonder  must have done
all of what
of the deal man
oh yeah right  the deal
but if you are mad at him too and he is mad at you  that must make us pals
as you prefer squire  as you prefer
in which case i will just do what i usually do
and that is
valentine had himself a party i hear
my client is an entrepreneur  i am his lawyer not his business manager

he is always been very forwardthinking he invested wisely

baron kurtz

mr lime  yes

und ich kann nicht alle kennen
sehen sie da gleich da unter da unten ist est passiert passiert  english
happenedyes happened right down there
could he have been conscious
conscious cas soll ich auch noch wissen
oh er  ohwas he  was he still alive
er alive he could not have been alive not with his head in the way it was
give evidence
there was a third man  he did not give evidence
you do not mean that doctor
fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei
now hold on
i have no evidence i saw nothing i said nothing it is not my business
yes it is
something wrong
that is all you meant
was not he at the police inquiry
he did not want to get involved
what else did he tell you
he probably knows a lot more than that somebody's lying
joseph harbin
third man
mr martins
should i make it all fact
that is the purpose of your visit here
a friend of mine offered me a job here
where are you staying
with him  fifteen stiffgasse
but danny if hashem is everything and we are nothing how are we to judge his actions
you think based on what
there's midrash supporting this my father read a book by shalom spiegel that  isaac actually died and was reborn
they only kill them when they love them
that is a fascist
i rest my case he is a jewish nazi he always was
whereas avi's a zionist nazi
the zionists are not nazis
they are racist they are militaristic they act like bullyboys in the territories
they do not have extermination camps
read the early zionists on european jewry they sound like goebbels
so she takes the pants in back  where they try them on and i think fuck it
are you shitting me right in the store
fucking danny man
that was an ark man that was a torah they fucked around with it and the torah melted their faces
that is a movie you moron
what do you think you are doing
bring your friends we are not his friends
what do you like it here
you coming
where did you read this robert faurisson
what do you care
i do not but
yeah but not on the letters
why the fuck not
you write that  come work for me you have got a lot to learn i can teach it to you
i have a job
this this is a joke  i will give your group a thousand bucks
you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine
fifty's an exaggeration anyway that was a different moment things were possible that are not now
actually i think this moment has possibilities that 
i do not care about money
you will
you are a jew maybe you do not realize it but you are
have you read toynbee spengler
nobody reads that stuff anymore
too difficult
too christian you know jameson paul virilio
the point is the modern world is a jewish disease
disease what disease
which is what
you are not in school what do you do
i work at the big boy warehouse in queens i drive a forklift
where would you read all that stuff
why no silencer
iund die worte zerfielen mir im munde wie modrige pilzei
and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms
are they still together
he is in a mental institution he is been there for ten years off and on mostly on
is he a nazi
i guess his parents are he does not care about that
that is he care about
you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness
you are not like the others are you your friends
i bet he did not realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one
too many good players down here i am with one right now
oh really
bigger and better
who's linda
why will not you talk to me
when can i see you
your father
where would you get this
but you can read it the hebrew right
what do you care
vayomer and he said  it goes the other way
oh yeah 
vayomer adonai el avram lech lecha mayartzcha oomimohladtcha oom'bayt avaycha el haertez asher arecha
hebrew's very difficult it would take years
put something on you are not supposed to be naked in front of it
why not
they think it is the word of god and it is holy and the flesh is not
that is stupid
what assholes
who gets contaminated the jews or the gentiles
good question both  aleph
it looks a little like a swastika
it is silent it holds a place takes a vowel the vowels are little dots that go under the letters
the sex is better
even though his dick is so big
no difference
christianity's silly but at least there's something to believe in or not believe judaism there's nothing
nothing but nothingnessjudaism's not about belief
that is it about
about doing things you light candles say prayers keep the sabbath visit the sick
fuck that
do not curse in front of it
why should i submit
you should not
no i think you should not
you are learning the hebrew really fast
i told you i am good at this
plus you have nothing else to do all day
what you think i am jewish
nazis talk about it all the time
the real nazis hitler goebbels they talked about jews incessantly you ever read their diaries
'cause he was not a rabbi
you want a punch in the mouth
okay  why do not we light candles on friday let's light candles and say the kaddish
you cannot do you know how many people i have brought intothe movement
come on we can be like eichmann he studied torah he hated jews
is it like eichmann are we goofing
i do not know i just want to try it
shit  did you talk to your mother today
no what are you looking for
nothing  why are you doing this  i thought god did not exist
he commands it whether he exists or not  look we can fight him and be crushed or we can submit
miriam called looking for you she said you might come so i
you gotta get out of here
carla it is me dannydanny balint we met at that[meeting at your house]
yeah i remember kill any jews yet
i did not realize you cared
i do not i was just curious how full of shit you were
did you know that there was a inew york timesi reporter there that night
really which one i bet it was the guy with the prada shoes
i did not notice his shoes did your mother know he was there
i doubt it how did you find out
that is a much easier game
i thought there were people here
who's eichmann
shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod
what would you say
why are you taking that
an investment banking house
that would be a catastrophic mistake
people hate jews do you agree
you would not announce it
i would say nothing after two or three people will try to find a pattern a reason
but when it comes out the public will be outraged it will look like germany all over again
totally the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven
insulting people who were in the camps that is the point
they are liars and cowards
i am sure they are but what do we accomplish by pointing it out
leo strauss  i have got to go to boston i came to say goodbye
a week or so there's something i want to do here first
what aboutmanzetti the synagogues
is it okay if i record this
what about curtis zampf
curtis is a politician  and a bit of a hustler he is not a thinker
i agree
it helps me concentrate so does that mean you are a white supremacist
what should i be a white inferior ist a multicultural zulu egalitarian let me ask where are your people from
a poison
let me give you an example sexuality
sexuality what do you mean
did you ever fuck one guy
that is that go to do withi have gone out with a with jewish women why
and what did you notice
notice like what
jewish girls like to give head right
i do not know is that right
and jewish men like to get it
everybody likes to do not they
does that mean the jew is the better lover
you are not listening he is not better he gives pleasure but that is actually a weakness
danny what makes you think you know all this
he has israel
those are not jews
what excuse me  you are kidding right
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park
who how would i know him
he says you were bar mitzvahed there in march 1988
you believe that and you call yourself a reporter
so you are saying it is not true
were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else
do you know who you are fucking with here
that is what i am trying to find out danny who am i fucking with here
listen to me
give me a reason not to
it is slander it is reckless disregard i will sue you and your fucking jew paper
two days ago you addressed a nazi rally last week you went to a torah study group
what were you following me
how do you reconcile the two
i do not look stay out of what you do not understand

i cannot say that
think about your father your sister
the truth does not mean anything to you does it
danny i am trying to  save you
you shut up who do you think you are
how did you get the fucking number
i want you to say kaddish for her it is the only thing she asked from us
i do not do that
you do it on the inside
do not tell me what i 
lina moebius and you are
it is german
what part of germany are you people from
from the rhineland originally
are you with the fbi mr balint or any other law enforcement agency
without blood  a willingness to spill it  there's no real power no authority
so what jew would you kill first
do you feel you are making progress here
you mean ilio manzetti
lina it is happening tonight
what is happening
beth shalom like you wanted
beth shalom what are you talking about who is this

the bible only says do not seethe a kid in its mother's milk but chickens do not give milk
look you want cheese go someplace else
but it is stupid right you admit it is stupid
no i do not admit it is stupid
you can have chicken with eggs but not with milk why is that
i am not here to talk about religious law if you do not like 
what are you doing here
then he could not be bitter about living alone
ah jesus christ danny how can you wear that thing you know what it means to your people

helen i want you to be my wife
i am married
just for the operation in paris i need to be married  they will be looking for a man traveling alone

it is just that it is been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that i
you can call me simon  you are very brave to do this  you opened it
what do you want me to do
who is this woman
his wife
doctor how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this
it is hard to say six months at least perhaps a year it depends to a certain extent on him

how would you get into the shipbuilding business gavin
interesting business
no to be honest i find it dull
how long have you been back
almost a year
