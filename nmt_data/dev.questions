the water's going putrid in the barrels
you will be drinking your own piss for the glory of spain and admiral colon  bastard
ah leave him alone  he is doing no harm
with a face like that  i do not want you looking at me  you hear
we will all go crazy
we left three weeks ago alonso cannot be that near
yes your eminence  the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ  are you familiar with the work of aristotle  erathostene  ptolemeus
i am your eminence
if they agree to follow me yes
blind faith is what i consider heresy
the judgment is ours
on the contrary your eminence  it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross
what a tragedy what a waste of a life
i know
i have not given you much of a life
well that is true  i have a child by a man who will not marry me  who's always leaving
are we going to argue
i would love to argue with you sometimes  but you are never here
i find that hard to believe
thank god
i do not want you to wait for me
that is something you cannot decide
you do not usually ask
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service
they tried but i did not let them
i am busy inside

bartolome and giacomo colon

there will be a time
you promise  do you swear on st christopher

this time with me
not bad
i am not listening father  but i cannot help hearing
he asks when he can come to visit you  he left his address
he never had one except aboard my ships
really  god i would not know where to start and yet
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind
i am not bargaining
then you are too ambitious
 for a commoner
don bobadilla is already a judge my dear don cristobal
good  we are also in need of judges  except there are no thieves
what  do i have so many already
to rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation  a little hypocrisy goes a long way
call them
look out of that window
roofs towers palaces spires
all of them created by people like me
what is it  a tribe  an island
island  far
tell the chief we thank him
chief knows
tell him his country is very beautiful  tell him we are leaving men here  to build a fort
chief says  he has a god
 and also to bring medicine
chief says
he has medicine  tell him we admire his people
he understands
ask him if he will help
you did the same to your god
you never learned how to speak my language
that is what it says
how did you manage it
with some difficulty  i had to promise them you were not a total fool
to open a new route to asia  at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it
ignorance  i believe the indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the canary islands
how can you be so certain
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr esdras
esdras is a jew
so was christ
i will try to remember that marchena
father marchena
passion is something one cannot control
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted
i have been contradicted all my life eternity
only god knows the meaning of such words my son
wait  i have waited seven years already  how much longer do you want me to wait
if god intends you to go then you will go
damn god
colon  do not
forgive me father  for i have sinned
father i have betrayed my family i betrayed my men  and i betrayed you
what are you saying
i lied  the journey will be longer than i said
how long
i am not sure it could be twice the distance
if i tell them they will not follow me  you know that i am right father  you trust me
give me absolution
you will always be older than me father
i knew you would
new worlds create new people
oh  so you are a new man
what did they say about granada before today
that she was impregnable
surely you can do anything you want
you show no inclination to speak otherwise
thirty seven your majesty and you
they come and go as naked as the day god created them
there is one thing i would like to understand why do you want to go back after all this
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders you will do as i say
we do not need to know
my horse does not work
you did not hear me don colon  not my horse
god be with us admiral

yes your majesty
never your majesty  although
yes  it would be a pity would not it  call him back
is this true brother buyl
he must be replaced
and who would you think of for such a task
then why
because he is not afraid of me
his grace is very angry with you
what do you mean
well how do you like it it is turkish my hairdresser tells me everything's going to be turkish this year
really what else did he tell you today give me some gossip
well i heard you met herr mozart
oh news travels fast in vienna
and he is been commissioned to write an opera is it true
well even if there is i do not think you want to get involved with this one
why not
well do you know where it is set my dear
that is that
a brothel
turkish oh if it is turkish that is different i want to be in it
my dear it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk
you might be disappointed
looks do not concern me maestro only talent interests a woman of taste
well what does it matter to you
nothing he can marry who he pleases i do not give a damn
you were sublime
what did you think of the music
extremely clever
meaning you did not like it

i am sorry madame but i have my orders
call herr mozart you call herr mozart immediately this is insupportable
young man i am no stranger to theatres i am no stranger to insolence
people who know say the girl's got talent you must judge for yourself if you think she stinks say so
yes he is a little strange
i would like a little wine if you have it
who was your teacher
i was but she quite outgrew the little i could show her
thank you madame  come on now  courage play me something you know
it is just a trifle of course
may i try it
you do me too much honour sire
let's have some fun  bring in herr mozart please but slowly slowly i need a minute to practice
finally such an immense joy diletto straordinario
excuse me sire but what do you think these could be being a foreigner i would love to learn
cattivo again court composer well tell him mozart name us a german virtue
your highness
i am thinking about herr mozart what is your view
and the result satisfies
yes of course my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
ahha favouritism but i so want mozart
majesty i did believe me it was a most agonizing decision but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart
why not
of course not
i have to tell you mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies
it is not a question of liking your majesty your own law decrees it i am afraid
well look at them
the director of our opera count orsinirosenberg
oh sir yes the honour is mine absolutely
really oh grazie signore sono commosso e un onore per mo eccezionale compositore brilliante e famossissimo
because i have already found the most wonderful libretto
it is actually quite amusing majesty it is set  the  whole thing is set in a  in a 
in a pasha's harem majesty a seraglio
what on one hearing only
i think so sire yes
yes indeed
and german
oh yes absolutely german unquestionably
so then you like it you really like it your majesty
well i mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say  how shall one say director
enchanted madame
well  well we have not quite received my father's consent your majesty not entirely not altogether
thank you sire
what is it
yes sire
yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true
who told you this majesty
it is not your place to ask questions is it true
well yes i admit it is
would you tell me why
well majesty it is only a comedy
ah love again
guess guess majesty imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
well six or seven minutes maybe eight
twenty sire how about twenty twenty minutes of continuous music no recitatives
you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade
sire the whole opera is finished do you know how much work went into it
in my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir plain german for plain people
well there it is
your majesty herr mozart 
yes what about him
he is here
ahha well there it is good
am i not welcome
of course welcome welcome ten thousand times papa my papa
i do not know stanzi stanzi
oh we could if we wanted to but stanzi will not hear of it she wants to do everything herself
how is your financial situation
it could not be better
that is not what i hear
what do you mean it is wonderful really it is  it is marvelous people love me here
they say you are in debt
who who says that now that is a malicious lie
how many pupils do you have
this one will
oh let's not talk about it
why not
it is a secret
you do not have secrets from me
it is too dangerous papa but they are going to love it ah there she is
why did not you mention it in your letters
did not i i thought i did i am sure i did
this is just a game papa
i want you to come back with me to salzburg my son
but my penalty i have got to have a penalty
i never saw this girl in my life  is this a kind of joke
no one calls you that
she does she says i sleep all day
good morning sir
what have you got for me today let me see
i will sir
yes thank you sir
bene bene

oh i would not know that sir
yes what

i am leaving i am not working there anymore i am scared
why what has happened
i do not know he has pains
is he working
i suppose so he sits there all he time doing some silly opera
opera opera
please do not ask me to go back again i am frightened i am very very frightened
are you sure it is an opera
that is right
papa the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room
that kind of music should be punishable by death
yes well it is all good fun
i liked the horse
what is this
put it down i said it is nothing for you
oh i am sorry i am sorry what have you got for me is it finished
because there's nothing to see
well we can
so let me see it where is it
what haha that is funny  i like it which one eh you are a funny fellow  hannah come this way
of course it is him who do you think it is
strudel this is herr mozart say good morning
well yes on the whole i suppose  how long have you been playing fraulein
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music
well your pupil is married and living in mannheim young man
really perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction
what is this mozart that is the matter with you
well since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead
what for
if a man cannot earn he must borrow
well this is hardly the way to go about it
please i will give it back i promise please sir
my answer is no mozart
ah love well of course in italy we know nothing about that
but this is absurd
did you like it then
how could i not
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today do not you agree
so you see this post is very important to me right now
i have just come from the palace the post has been filled
whom did they choose
herr sommer
sommer herr sommer but the mangs a fool he is a total mediocrity
no no no he has yet to achieve mediocrity
you do not mean to tell me you are living in poverty
no but i am broke i am always broke i do not know why
it has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
how can anyone say that we have no cook no maid we have no footman nothing at all
how is that possible you give concerts do not you i hear they are quite successful
do you have a daughter
i am afraid not
i would better not it is a bit of a secret
come come mozart i am interested truly
actually it is a big secret oh this is delicious what is it
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum crema al mascarpone
ah italian
forgive me we all have patriotic feelings of some kind
two thousand two hundred florins is all i need a hundred fifty
what exactly are you working on
i cannot say really
it is unbelievable the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music pages of it
really why
oh no my wife took it out in time
how fortunate
it is not fair that a man like that has power over our work
but there are those who have power over him i think i will take this up with the emperor
oh excellency would you
with all my heart mozart
thank you oh thank you
i think it is marvelous truly
it is the best opera yet written i know it why did not they come
grazie mio caro wolfgang
grazie a lei signor antonio
how could i not
did my work please you
how could it not excellency
you flatter me
oh no one hears such sounds and what can one say but  salieri
what work
a mass for the dead
what dead who is dead
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one
who are you
i am only a messenger do you accept you will be paid well
how much
work fast and be sure to tell no one what you do you will see me again soon
are you neglecting my request
no no i promise you i will give you a wonderful piece  the best i ever can
i am taking you home you are not well
no no i have to get back i have 
not here she is not well either she went to the spa
you mean she is not coming back
you are so good to me truly thank you

i mean to come to my opera you are the only colleague who did
this is only a vaudeville
i do
i have bad fancies i do not sleep well anymore then i drink too much and think stupid things
are you ill
the doctor thinks i am but 
no no it is him
what man
he knows he knows
yes can i  could i help you in any way
would you actually you could
my dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure
but you would have to swear not to tell a soul i am not allowed
of course
a mass a mass for the dead
the end of the recordare  statuens in parte dextra
so now the confutatis confutatis maledictis when the wicked are confounded flammis acribus addictis how would you translate that
consigned to flames of woe
do you believe in it
oh yes
we ended in f major
what time
common time
sing it back
first bassoon and tenor trombone  what
with the tenors
also identical
exactly the instruments to go with the voices trumpets and timpani tonic and dominant
oh no now for the fire  strings in unison  ostinato on all  like this
i think so
show me
sopranos up to f on the second 'voca'
yes and on  wouldictis'
you go fast
do you have it
oh no i am not tired at all
we will stop for just a moment then we will do the lacrimosa
i can keep going i assure you shall we try
would you stay with me while i sleep a little
i am not leaving you
i am so ashamed
what for
i was foolish i thought you did not care for my work  or me forgive me forgive me
well not especially it can be in turkish if you really want i do not care
but your majesty 
just let me tell you how it begins
certainly herr director
yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaro's wedding
exactly a dance
but surely the emperor did not mean to prohibit dancing when it is part of the story
it is dangerous for you to interpret his majesty's edicts give me your score please
taking out what you should never have put in
oh yes certainly certainly herr director
what is what
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl
because his majesty wishes it
is the emperor angry with me
on the contrary
then why does not he simply appoint me to the post
mozart you are not the only composer in vienna
no but i am the best
a little modesty would suit you better
who is on this committee
kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri
naturally the italians of course always the italians
may i just do that majesty show you how it begins just that
oh german german please let it be german
i am father vogler i am a chaplain here i thought you might like to talk to someone
about what
you tried to take your life you do remember that do not you
what do you want
do you understand that you have sinned gravely
leave me alone
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain
do you know who i am you never heard of me did you
that makes no difference all men are equal in god's eyes
are they
offer me your confession i can offer you god's forgiveness
i do not seek forgiveness
i know a little i studied it in my youth
then you must know this
i did not that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is
of course the man you accuse yourself of killing
ah  you have heard that
all vienna has heard that
and do they believe it
is it true
do you believe it
should i
he was murdered father mozart cruelly murdered
every day sometimes for hours i would pray
no was mozart a good man
oh i thought you did so every day so speak now answer me
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries i treasure them as you should
i did
no you did not
i poisoned his life
but not his body
what difference does that make
my son why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer is that your penance is it
i have seen the manuscript
about the ballet
ballet what ballet
excuse me  did not his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
yes absolutely is there a ballet in figaro
yes in the third act
well done sire
did we
for the same reason herr chamberlain that it was banned in france
oh yes yes and that was
what who the devil are you

i know exactly what you mean  hey honey

we will make do  i am of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then
i want him to at least see the sky

yes dear i know
i thought ten years
some time

i guess we should not fight in here
i knew you would like him
outoftown  that is all he will say
oh yes
i even guessed his hotel did not i
oh my god
exactly  you understand that do not you  you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that
money is no object  he is got cards up the wazoo
that is that supposed to mean
it means that your taste in mengs apparel is as bad as your taste in men
well that is blunt
i am sorry but if the shoe fits
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing do not you
i see elegant
yeah like ralph lauren
that is what i am sensing
i am busy tomorrow anyway i have to buy six thousand paper napkins
what do you think adam
i thinkitworks
let me show you the entire trousseau
he is from alaska
always good advice
for him it does not work for the rest of us
adam  i think for you we should go for sweet
it is not so much what you say but how you say it  women like men who are unpredictable
right here  well you are being so bossy i was not sure
uhhe might of
we did not leave together
who did he leave with
i am his pimp he left with the dancers did not he
hey you are the psychic eve the psychic pimp  you tell me
those sluts
yeah but who's not a slut these days

what  now hold on  wait one damn minute
and i do not fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards
uh yes you do
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean
yes you do
or have perfect table manners
well consider the source i do not even know what a lady is
from the oddest place his parent's told him i do not think i got that memo
so now i suppose he is trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible
he did not leave with them
welli admit it i am glad to hear that
he left with sophie
oh no not sophie no way please do not tell me that
you are goddamn right i am
fallout shelter

actually that is not gonna be necessary
what the hell are you talking about call her

i am outta portland  sonrisa did not want local talent
but the boss knows i always been loyal
what the hell are you doing
who's camille
none of your business
you did not tell me you lived with her
you know each other
leave  now
can i say something in my defense
you mean until you showed up
you are not still pissed
justine was not an unwilling participant
she was there
could you give us a moment
it was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued causing you to maybe take offense
i live here guess i do not have to ask what you are doing here
you are roommates
police drone
what  where are we going
no time
no way
unless you wanna end up in jail let me and kendra handle the cops
do not look down
like de prophets say only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift wrapped underpants to another woman
it concerns only jah  but in this case i was the instrument of the most high
yeah well around here i am the most high from now on before you do anything call in for instructions
i did not  it was a present from a guy
must think you are pretty special laying this on you
thought so  turned out he wanted me for something else though
same old story  not interested
thought i would let you have first crack later
a grand
i will give you seventyfive bucks for it
i will make it worth your while
it is a rule
am i
i got overhead
thanks it is starting to kick in  i feel almost human
yeah me too
and for all his catting around not much of a stick man either
you did not
every week
shhh  do not do that
they took my daughter
i know
can you help me get her back
look i would really like to
we are not going that route  sonrisa's not someone you make deals with
what else can we do
like i said this is not my regular line of work so i am making it up as i go
i do not want to move away
i know honey but just think how exiting it will be new house new school new friends
but why cannot we stay here
because we cannot  there's nothing here for us anymore
are we in some kind of trouble
if i am sad or tired or sometimes when i am angry or when somebody's being mean to me
pretty much the same reasons i was crying  but things will be better when we move to a new place
then i am gonna do what you do to make me feel better when i am sad
mommy where are you
do not worry i am coming to get you
mommy i am scared
there's nothing to be afraid of everything's going to be alright
girl's gotta make a living
thank god
first time i ever heard that
i was expecting someone else
guess it was not the pizza delivery guy
you are lucky  i almost pulled the trigger
we are just a little tense right now  it is okay
whoever that is
so what you liked it because it was shiny
no because it is the egyptian goddess bast
who is
we did not get a chance to finish our conversation the other night
logan cale
can we go somewhere and talk
the one you are wearing
was not that hard
am i s'posed to be flattered by all the attention
too early to tell
how does mrs eyes only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list
laurengs not my wife
that is your shot in all this  being a famous anonymous underground pirate cyberjournalist cannot be much of a payday
fortunately my needs are met in that department
so what you just like the sound of your own voice
so what are you gonna do about it
is the social studies class over for today
i will not be staying
i am not a half bad cook
it was open
you got a lotta nerve
me  you are the one who tried to rip off this piece
how do i know you did not
so saw my hands off i left you a present
am i s'posed to be grateful
that would be appropriate yes
how'm i s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything i own
you are that nervous you are welcome to stay here
it is alright peter we are fine
we are not fine
yes on all counts
i am sorry  it was not my intention  but i had to see you
you need to get out more
c'mere i want to show you something
no i meant this
only when i meet someone i have to know everything about
the other ones
the other one like you
you lost me
you did go through my stuff
how well do you remember the lab
i know they made me  even got the label on my neck to prove it
the technical term for you is chimera
yeaha madeup creature  like in mythologywith the head of a lion the body of a goat and the tail of
a girl
your basic hodgepodge
you said you could help
your help
i already do not like the sound of this
she is put her life on the line and her faith in me
somebody's got to
not in any painthe good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord
i am sorry
my mother used to say the universe is right on schedule  everything happens like it is supposed to
you believe that
open it
i do not know what to say
deeds not words  i need your help
you are involved  by being alive you are involved
we are quoting mom again
with your help
ladies would be elsewhere
you do not want to
but she does work here
she may be easy on the eyes but she is trouble trust me  hot run to twoohtwo sansomme
i need to talk to her
cannot help you
any idea when she will be back
a friend of your fiance's
what do you want
to set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late
my name's lydia  and it seems you and i have a lot in common
you said you knew where my fiance was the other night
i thought it was important for you to know the facts
how sweet  standing by your man even after what he did  you are a very understanding person
big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them
you are also a fool
i think you should go now
let go of my hand
i understand
and if i ever catch you coming near my man again
you did
you drive away business roaring in like that
yeah does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got going on here
you got a punkass mouth on you kid
then what
then what  that is it  that is all i got
nothing on hannah
nothing so far from arrests hospital admissions or coroners  this kind of searchit is heavy spadework  i am gonna need
more money like i am shocked to hear you say that
here's your money
how is this about me
hardware's too sophisticated  it is gotta be the government  and why do i think they are looking for you
you are crazy
i am you i take that money and get outta town while you can
you and me both
sure you wanna be having this conversation over the phone
just do it fivesevenfiveoh eight
got a pencil
just give it to me  i will remember
onesevenfourninefive natoma
i am on my way
what guys do  'nother order
you are way more philosophical than i could ever be
i just do not go in with any expectations
you are not seriously buying into darrengs nonsense
you know what i am saying
if i knew what you were saying i would not be asking
how long you and me known each other
a long time
long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right
because you are probably my closest friend in the whole world
and back at ya  only there's a part of you that is i do not know
a fog bank
more like a mystery which is not bad it is just kinduvmysterious
yeah 'cause maybe he is learned his lesson
friends do not help other friends cheat
and because i actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes
so are dogs
they do not have a lot of moving parts
only one i can think of
besides think of the drama i am sparing natalie
i will bet you can  sit
not right now  okay when
right after you change your wardrobe your personality and drop about thirty pounds
quite a mouth on a girl so young  but my guess is talking is not what it does best
you are gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars
what you gonna put me on your christmas card list
i have sincere eyes
she is gonna need to know that her little girl's alright
she is got my word
she is gonna want to hear for herself
you get it when i get her
you are the best maxie
feel like the dog's dinner
probably a touch of that is going around
what if he is on the level
you can tell 'em yourself tomorrow
i gotta meet natalie for dinner
right the big oneoh
but i will take a rain check
we gotta talk
that is up
you left out condescending
but there's another side
here it comes  the part where the guy turns everything around
i am the victim here
and you were a sympathetic ear
i am a toy to her
a toy
who either does not care or could have me killed  either way natalie's still gonna find out
what happens if you level with her
even if she does not dump me which is unlikely she would never be able to trust me again
and why should she
a philandering pig
how would you get her out of town
convinced her she needed to visit her mom in san mateo
and we are sure lydia's gonna make her move
max what did i do to deserve a friend like you
you do not
easy sketchy
no i am serious  that psycho got exactly what she deserved yes
lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but
she is toxicmonster in bed but toxic
say the words i understand
i was on call 
i want you on call here
that is the difference if i am on call here or deployed in the field
more like deployed in bed asleep
i do not sleep theo asked me to pick up his check
and theo cannot pick up his own check because
he is sick
for a change
how about you do not break my sneakers on this  the guy is seriously not well
i do not know how to break this to you normal we are all looking for another job

thanks are hardly necessary
aw shucks ma'am t'were not nothing
i am glad to see you have not lost your sense of humor
it ai not for lack of trying
so it seems may we be serious for a moment
why doctor we have only just met
please sit down
besides i do not want to be what you want to make me
and that is that
normal average
all right will you please sit down now  symington says
did you really say that
just a little joke miss farmer
this whole thing is a joke
stay calm please
you did not say 'symington says'
yes it was very good to see her
really any problems
i never said oh look that is just a figure of speech she said something funny and i said
and you accused her of tampering with your mail
oh for christ's
dr symington how big is your dick
sedate her
no no
good because brothers that is you
you are kidding
yeah well you know doctors they sure hate to use that word
they always say that
hmmm she is beneath me i am afraid
i wish she was beneath me
congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods  probably their whores
over three hundred miles
you seem pleased by the prospect
well you fought with them against the french and iroquois how good were they then
they do not trust me that is the truth is not it  sam adams never did
congress is talking  openly  about replacing you with lee
is that a fact
it is
do not do anything rash please benedict
the army can survive without me
then i need you  we all do without your victory the men would have no hope at all
christ george joseph reed's been writing letters back to congress attacking you  your own aide
well truth be told  i was a pharmacist  alexander
i  you all know my history
while they are strung out
there's this whispering campaign against me ever since gates won at saratoga
there then you can have sort of a normal life
i am sure his dogs will be overjoyed
tell mrs washington i am compelled to stay a while longer
you are never never to touch my guns  do you understand
yes general  but if you have to shoot somebody you cannot
none of the servants is to touch a gun  you know that
well i misunderstood then
a lot of years have gone by
what  what are you talking about
that you would have known you can trust me
yes william  i am apologizing
wil i am giving you your freedom do you understand
no  i guess
i ai not forgot about the freedom
no my lord
and is that a pitchfork beside him
many of them many did not possess proper arms  my lord
by red what rank would you say this black officer soldier is colonel
i do not know what color is what officer my lord
more than that sir my orders from congress
lafayette will not be happy
the british  these men cannot stand against them
that is greene  he is supporting our reconsolidation
marquis  get these men reformed send steuben and wayne out on the left
hamilton you are going to have to cover our asses as we cross
we have got powder but no ball
then use rocks
i will be twenty next year sir
i will expect you for dinner this evening captain hamilton  for christ's sake have a bath
delighted sir
well sir then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear
and is that the most horrible thing in the world
that young school teacher i heard the british hung him as a spy
it is a wonder they find the british cause worth dying for
to learn to shoot cannon
we better congress invented him
do not lie to me hamilton  if i had not courtmartialed arnold
sir arnold is a traitor
i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect
i am not conscious of it sir  but since you have thought it necessary to tell me so we part
congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions
no one knows
to hell with arnold
yes i believe so
i am not sure
george you are the only man the people trust trust with power they know you will not betray them
but it is more than just that am i right
good day mister adams george that is the word from boston
who the hell knows  everyone's giving orders  it is all very democratic
george we have got to get you out there before we lose our whole army
yes an astonishing power over weak minds
as does your ability horatio  we must talk further when it is more convenient
i think many would like to see him commanderinchief
is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went
gag on your own invention then
oh come now
you invented this this
if he is not then he is stupid
these men have suffered but i believe they will fight
general lee is detained captain
detained by what
the british army sir
we already have black soldiers in our army
unofficially general greene
that is the difference
spies from quebec confirm that the british are sending an entire fleet down lake champlain
a fleet
what can he do  the british have massive superiority
george  so good to be back
a ground swellchristian movement george you see
no  as a matter of fact i have not the slightest idea what you are talking about
and hamilton  greene
they help me understand why we fight
the man is a traitor
how can you say that
well i shall deny him to you  he is evil on earth
but general i assure you my motives are sincere
the one with 'philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit
mon general i have come here to learn and to give not to take  i am serving without salary
you must be very rich
i only meant
these supplies
muskets and uniforms and bayonets
and how rusty are these muskets
sir these are our finest firearms from the armory at charleville they are a gift from the people of france
i rode here on my horse
chose another  any general worth anything should have a brace of horses
when the snow melts mon petite marquis i suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red british soldiers
my baby daughter has died my baby mon petite henriette
general lee sir
get these men back in line
i will continue with our french allies concentrating on new york
my god these people mean to go to war  they really mean it
surely you knew this was coming
but to go to war over trade over money  surely there's still time for a compromise
of course if it were that simple  these people  they are after something else
my god what
the eternal dream of the disenfranchised my dear  a classless world  not a very real expectation
you are no fool george  you never have been
it is an antichristian dogma  i cannot believe you are so calm about it
what else  from virginia
well i would not want to trouble you with this now
some things must never change
is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men it is damned condescending
do not condescend to me  we have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind
leave me now sir i am tired
come out and meet my soldiers they are good people
i want you to see our hospital
i do not want to see your hospital
we are leaving them
they are finished they cannot help us anymore  they have done their duty general greene now you do yours
yes yes happy to meet you
i i am possessed of the idea of a command in your army sir
i have commanded the rhode island militia for a year now  my father is an ironmaster  as was i
you wrong me general i am an officer and a horseshoer
i am with captain hamilton
yes i thought that is how you would feel nathanael
you have a free tongue captain hamilton
but you are an aristocrat and a slave owner  sir
then maybe i do see what you are after  perhaps you get to chose again
it is we need you george
is that the truth  well we cannot carry on like animals any longer
but not more than your comfort
i remember a pair of young philosophers once who laughed at the world
mankind is born free but everywhere he is in chains
words words words  sally has been tutoring george in the philosophies is not that right
africa of course
africa  that is so far  how do they get here
slavers capture them and bring them here
capture them  well i have never seen anything like it so of course i am curious
sally our slave system is a british law
or 'civilized'
in the minuet george every movement is significant like the strut of cranes
it is stupid of course
the place to want to be is america every english child dreams of it i dreamt it
i think america suits you
is it  well i am scared of what we have become in our freedom
well we must be who we must be
let's get you darker
you are out of your mind
why  juba was an african and you want to look the part  hold still
they can use their imaginations
those people  i doubt they would think of this  ooo you are wonderful this color
and dost thou live to ask it
that is good who
voltaire of course
just because they are born
i say
i see
and 'others' say have you even read locke vattel voltaire diderot
that  i hear a mob  unemployed drunkards vagabonds the world's dregs
though sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season
this this is life indeed  life worth preserving such life as juba never felt till now
juba was a numidian
he was not black  he was tan weathered
do not be silly you have whole worlds to fathom
nope what are you making pancakes
not if i do not find that goddamn spatula
it is tough to find a good job without any kind of training
look i told you i am not going to college
someone from the past
i made spaghetti do you want some
ii really have to get up early for class tomorrow
what is it now
are you still looking for a job
i guess
i have got some important news to tell you but it can wait till later if you are not feeling
are you going to yell at me
about what
yeah i heard about that
actually i was just checking to see if you were here  your friend seymour is on his way up

dana hi  uh dana this is enid
oh  please  do not let me interrupt finish your phone call
it is just that i feel like it is maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out
please tell me it is not that teenager
enid it is sort of like a diary i guess
it is supposed to be don knotts
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject
i dunno i just like don knotts
i see interesting
well no  it is more like a found art object
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism
i am not really sure  working i guess
i dunno would i have to take classes and stuff
well yes
what do you mean
the whole business with the art show and the newspaper  it is absolutely 
i did not check my messages
why what difference does it make you already got his money
look that is the policy if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater
but i was only trying to be friendly
look we do not pay you to be a movie critic  just do your job
okay okay i will not say a word
what i am just kidding around with the customers it is my shtick
well lose it and why are not you pushing the large sizes did not you get training about upsizing
but i feel weird it is so sleazy
it is not optional
look i already told you i am not going to give you a ride
what can you tell me young man about the various flavors of frozen yogurt
look i will be done in a minute just wait outside
i am afraid i do not understand i simply wish to know

i feel as though i have stepped into a time warp
can we call you weird al
you loser
i know and instead of dessert it says mindbenders

yeah josh c'mon move it
it is still twentyfive minutes early
i am going to tell him you said that
she says she wants to mmph

seymour i promise you that was not a joke  you have to call her back

i thought you were like the fifth ghostbuster
i let them handle all the little stuff  i just come in on the big ones
okay so can you tell us when it is going to happen or do we have to buy the book
i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year's eve
objection  irrelevant and immaterial
no i guess i am just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it

i think they are more interested in my epididymis
i do not even want to know where that is

we are running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction
what kind of tests

i know what they are worth  give me fifty and get them out
but you must have 
i must have nothing  their my husband's
and you must not be getting along too well right now huh
years  this collection is as close as he is ever come to an achievement
look i i am sorry  i do not want to be any part of this
suit yourself  there are plenty of others who will
that is why i am trying to compromise what about fifteenhundred  they are worth five times that
and i will not take a penny over ninety
i am sorry but i think you better talk to someone else
sure  ten cents
oh really  you two are slamming to nico now
well we do not
i cannot frisk you but the cops can
fuck off
we are not there yet justin
i am vince
it is really nice of you to help us
i wish i could do more but we are moving out
we are going with you i mean we are going too
if we do we will both die virgins but at last we will be together
you have to leave the white house
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion
you do not understand you have to leave washington
i have worked with embedded loading they are communicating with a hidden signal they are going to attack
you are being paranoid
it is not paranoia the embedding is very subtle it is probably been overlooked
david how would you get this number
walk to the window right in front of you
fifty six minutes forty five seconds
i want you to leave with us right now
i cannot leave we have to tell this to the president
he is not going to listen to me
david do not
i take it you have heard
a toast to the end of the world
he is a good man
better be you left me for him
i wanted a career did not you ever want to be part of something special
we will be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off
did it work
you bet it did
punched the president oh my god
my exhusband works in satellite communications
think nothing of it spanky
all he could think about was getting to you there's still love there i think
love was never our problem
all you need is love john lennon smart man shot in the back very sad
more than likely
he used to run the nasa he knows where all the bones are buried comes in handy
i will bet
then get them out of there
it was turned on i was ignoring you that is the big emergency
so sue me
please would i be this panicked if it was that simple
we have tried it is not working it is almost as though they were not even there
that is the bad news
you are in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch
and the good news is you will not charge me
huh oh good good
what are you talking about
have not you been watching
what happened
just do it
remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction
not really
that signal it is a countdown
a countdown to what
think it is like in chess first you strategically position your pieces then when the timing's right you strike
i am thinking
so think already
you do not move soon i will begin to decompose
i am only saying it is been what four years you still have not signed your divorce papers
three years
three four move on it is not healthy
you still got the olds
you want to borrow the car you do not have a license
that is okay you are driving
cannot this thing go any faster
this pops is every phone book in america
you think an important person like constance is going to be listed
she always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies sometimes it is just her first initial sometime her nickname
i just have not found it yet i tried c halbrook connie halbrook spunky halbrook
you try martin
she did not take my name when we were married
it is perfect the line is busy
yes i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house
you can do that
because last time i saw him i punched him in the face
you punched the president in the face
he was not the president then
moishe please do not talk
i am making a mess
this i can see
what would i say
a cold of course
i want you should know i am very proud of you son

that was our assessment as well
where did this come from
my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of ankara while excavating for copper  can you translate the inscription
every mangs dream  including your father's i believe
you could be more right than you know
we already have your father is the man who's disappeared
as what a nazi stooge like you

in that case i permit you
but i am already sad  by tomorrow it will have faded
tomorrow i will steal you another
except he is lost and i am not
lower me down
right six hundred years before the crusades
the christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later
are you sure
pretty sure
look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork
it is a rubbing dad made of the grail tablet
he never would have made it past the rats he hates rats he is scared to death of them
you said go between them
i said do not go between them
mine too
what were they looking for
oh yes give them a flower and they will follow you anywhere

how do you know
where is it i want it
my father did not want it incinerated
all i have to do is scream

you do not need the diary dad marcus has the map
there is more in the diary than just the map
all right dad  tell me
well he who finds the grail must face the final challenge
what final challenge
three devices of such lethal cunning
booby traps
oh yes but i found the clues that will safely take us through in the chronicles of st anselm
but what are they cannot you remember
i wrote them down in my diary so that i would not have to remember
half the german army's on our tail and you want me to go to berlin into the liongs den
yes the only thing that matters is the grail
what about marcus
marcus would agree with me
two selfless martyrs jesus christ
i do not know the first available flight out of germany
that is not all we shared it is disgraceful you are old enough to be her fa er her grandfather
well i am as human as the next man
i was the next man
ships that pass in the night

we did not talk we never talked
and do i detect a rebuke
dad how can you
very well i am here now
i do not know we will find out
fly yes land no
what happens at eleven o'clock
more or less  son i am sorry they got us
i know dad
it is a new experience for me

this could be close
dad we are well out of range

junior dad

i will take the camels
i do not need camels

then we will die
my soul is prepared how is yours
no doctor jones it is yours
if you let me go i will tell you where he is
who are you
my name is kazim
and why were you trying to kill me
i did not come for the cup of christ i came to find my father
just a routine inspection tour
the british worry so about their empire  it makes us feel like well caredfor children
i am sure that will please the maharajah captain
as i said before we would be happy to escort you to delhi
no but i am interested in the occult and this is a kryta
you think so
of course admittedly it is taken time britaings controlled india for almost two hundred years now
something magical a sacred rock
did you discover anything in that tunnel dr jones
you should have been there
no no that is uhmed singh the present maharajah's late father
oh  good and maybe the present maharajah is a little younger and thinner
his highness has not yet taken a wife
no well i guess he just has not met the right woman
what are you talking about  i am not a dope fiend i saw it i will show you
a very fine collection of very old pieces do not you think
there are no stories anymore
maybe but how do you explain the thuggee shrine i saw right below the palace
dr jones in our country a guest does not usually insult his host
sorry i thought we were just talking about folklore
when they lost this rock their fields and animals died they also said their children were taken from them
i think that is enough of this nonsense dr jones
and did not the sultan of madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country
that was a misunderstanding
exactly what we have here dr jones
lao she
nee chin lie how ma
i do not like to show off
sure i found him then last night i had a little trouble somebody tried to slit my throat
next time i will cut off more than his finger
dr jones  i want nurhachi
a bonus dr jones that is poison you just drank the rest of it
at last i have the ashes of my sacred ancestor
step on it short round
okeydoke indy hold onto your potatoes
sure indy  three tickets you me and wu han 
it is just superstition shorty like a ghost story
nope you got a little surprise over there shorty
that is it pankot palace
just a statue
you do not like him do you
next time i flatten him did you see his eyes
yeah that is what happened
okay shorty see you in the morning i am going to have a little  word with willie
follow in the footsteps of shiva do not betray his truth
why they glow like that
legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow
behind you
read you loud and clear indy
nobody's perfect the way i heard it you stole one of them from a small village
you do not believe me you will dr jones you will become a true believer
you are in no position to give orders dr jones
mola ram  you are about to meet kali  in hell
you are betrayed shiva 
pankot is not on the way to delhi
you will go to palace there
has not the pankot palace been deserted since the mutiny of 1857
no now there is new maharajah  and palace is powerful again
i do not understand that is happened here
the evil starts in pankot then like monsoon it moves darkness over all country
what evil
they came from palace and took sivalinga from out village
nobody brought us here our plane crashed we were shot down by 
long ago  before my father's father
they say we must pray to their evil god we say we will not
i am sorry i do not know how i can help you here
hey he is not a waiter
who cares where is that diamond
relax i have been giving him lessons
do not get your hopes up  where is the antidote
poison never agrees with me  pull a right short round and head for the wang poo bridge
the airport no look out short round left left
get over here damn it short round come on grab onto me tight
he told me they knew i was coming here
what do you mean  how
the old man saw it in a dream
dream  nightmare is more like it
he said that is whey they were at river  they were waiting for the plane to fall down
that is more food than these people eat in a week  they are starving too
it is a sacred stone in a shine that is supposed to protect a village
their children
it was destined that i came here  and the future cannot be changed
stark naked you wish if you are trying to seduce me dr jones this is a very primitive approach
do not worry i am coming in what is it
a snake
a snake
uh listen  willie  i got a better idea
it is pulling me deeper
do not let it curl around you
it is curling around me damn it stop talking and do something
just one arm
okay i want you to lift your hand  and pet the snake
pet it
yes stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae
the what
pet it on the head go on pet it
keep stroking it
it is starting to let go
that is good  you are doing fine
i know the feeling
i met short round when he tried to pick my pocket
he will be okay he is a good kid
oh that is easy  i am going to latch onto a goodlooking incredibly rich prince

mr massey
so i will not be seeing her your clients usually visit me after the settlement

everyone needs plastic surgery you need it
i do not need it
you want botox
what the hell is botox
no frown lines  new watch
it is a lecoultre revers you can flip the face and set it for two time zones
why would you need two time zones you never leave beverly hills
it was a gift from a client
set one side for bel air
botox christ we had aspirations when we were in college
we did not
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon i was going to clerk for the supreme court
i was going to play golf you were going to have asian girlfriends
denial is not a river in egypt
i should be in therapy
got any symptoms
yes the inability to experience pleasure
oh that  do not waste time with your queen
she cannot really love that idiot can she
doyle oil  a massey prenup  she loves him
he is the wrong man
miles do not waste time with someone else's queen either
thanks buddy
is she asian
asian no
well i am still
you have the prenup
no i have the ring was i supposed to have a prenup
no you have the ring wrigley has the prenup
oh i thought maybe   gee
i already made my move kenneth
what do you mean was
rex just had a massive coronary in the middle of a business meeting he is dead
marvin says that rex's will is four years old he never redrafted it
so that is good right
that was  oh shit what if he is on his way over there
i do not know but do not call me marylin
except for two years when he was in the navy in korea
prior to your marriage what was your profession
i was a hostess for transworld airlines
what is your husband's profession
he manufactures staples and industrial bradtacks he is very successful
ruth rabino
i cannot have a baby with a man i do not love and i cannot submit a child to divorce
maybe she wanted a free trip to la maybe they offered her money massey is very seductive who knows
maybe they put a horse head in her bed
in the godfather after the courtroom scene frankie pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub
it is about time
i said yes
i think ming is older than tong  what is this
oh boy if he only knew
yeah i guess you know 
i will be right back
and you must be mr massey
positano is beautiful remember when we were there rex we stayed in the santo pietro that hotel on the cliff
not according to mrs rabinow
is not everything
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery for where a heart is hard they make no battery
did you see the tape
not yet
see the tape then we can discuss my heart
what does your lawyer think
ruth says you have been too successful that you are bored complacent and you are on your way down
but you do not agree
how do you know
why would you be here
i told you i was hungry
i know you do
you did not ask me here to pick me up you could get in trouble for that
as a matter of fact i am a huge fan
you just have not met the right person
no i have not have you
oh i am a lot like you  just looking for an ass to mount
well do not look at mine
and you have always loved him
yes why is that so difficult for you to understand
have you ever met mr rexroth
that is true is not it miles your prenup is the best there is
that is correct not to blow my own horn but they devote an entire semester to it at harvard law
to him he is a sick freak
he is passionate
passionate he is a pervert he should have to register when he moves
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time
marylin listen to me
we told you we realized we have always been in love
so i hear is that all
no that is not all
howard is a beautiful person
well when this goes south  promise you will have dinner with me
have you tried the duck
although knowing you as i do  there will be no settlement this time it will be complete and total annihilation
i do not feel victorious miles i feel betrayed abandoned and humiliated i have pictures of him with another woman
more pictures my god marylin you can open an erotic art gallery
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs
no just to comfort you and appreciate you 
you are right about me i am worthless i am nothing i do not deserve to live
marylin when did i say
marylin forgive me but are you  drunk
a little  you get out of the car that is right fuctard i am talking to you
you should not be driving where are you
i am on sunset near the beverly hills hotel wanna meet me for a drink in the polo
no do not stop
okay miles
thank you
you have wonderful art i love that lithograph hockney
yes i just got that actually it was a gift
from a  girlfriend
no no i do not have a no it was from a client
no kidding i will bet you have some very grateful clients what would rex buy you
rex sent me two humidors full of pre castro cubans
me yes
oh and that is  mom
yeah mom mom and brother
you look like you were a very sensitive child you have expressive eyes
she never particularly cared for me
she did not love you
apparently she was very disappointed
boy boy oh boy
your mother was
oh right you met patricia
no we are not
i am a little embarrassed i am not used to losing control with such  volume
and i am not used to  marylin  there's something i want to ask you
what is it miles
i want i want to
did you just propose to me
yes miles i accept
you do
do you want me to sleep on it
no ma'am i have been asleep all my life up to this moment marylin will you marry me
yes again
i know
i have a watch
yes short notice you know but i think there's nice closure to it hello judge muson a pleasure as always
oh miles
what i mean is your wealth is completely protected
no stay i want you close to me this couch is wrong it is not a married couch
in fact this is not a married house  it is a bachelor pad
hardly you have six bedrooms
well i suppose i could girly it up for you with a little fortuny and some passementerie 
good  are those foods
fabric and fringe
i have a surprise for you
i bet
i love you i want to have your baby
that is wrong miles did i spend too much
may i come in
i do not believe you have things
i want to nail you ass
are you threatening me because i am sure that is a violation of the terms of your bail
i am reporting you to the irs
the irs they owe me i am expecting a refund
i am not talking about dollars studmuffin i am talking about 
what kind of stuff
salary unreported income  by the way what time is it on bellagio road
you cannot prove anything
i believe the residence will be part of the settlement
did our marriage ever mean anything to you
drop the bogus forgery charge and i will forget about your generous friends slash clients
that is blackmail
that is marriage
you have to leave the house immediately
i will miles i will leave but miles 
no buts now out
just listen to me i am sorry miles it is true that my initial intention was to
please leave the house
i fell in love miles
so did i now pack up a few basics and 
you do you do love me
now but first he worked for you
you were going to have this thug
wait just a second there you sent him here you unearthed this pestilence
that is true
i am not leaving you i took self defense
hello miles
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us
it is not something i wanted either
but then  i guess  something inside me died when i realized that you would hired a goon to kill me
yes i know it is exactly how i felt when i realized you would hired the goon to kill
your forgetting rex rexroth
you are forgetting howard doyle
forgery fraud
income tax evasion
look marylin cannot we have a civilized discussion about this
we are and it is winding down
my whole metabolism is  off
you have some
sometimes i forget
we were about to request the primary residence and thirty percent of the remaining assets
thank you mrs rexroth
you used his credit card
he told me to  he said he wanted me to 
he was right was not he
so now what
now well marylin now you cut a deal or find out how jean harris made it work for her
i did not know barry had a beach house
neither did i until my lawyer found it  quite a paper trail  he had it in the dog's name
she did a harriman
of massey myerson
do you know him
by reputation he got ann rumsey that cute little island of george's
now she is a night manager at mcdonalds
i wish i had your discipline
i do not know ruth kept her cool but i could tell she was surprised
he has a reputation for being tough
oh god
i am dying
well if he continues to maintain this position  we are in court
so marylin is that what you said when you were a little girl
probably every woman in my life was divorced at least twice what was i supposed to say anthropologist
no i will see some blood before this is over but it will not be mine
hello miles
i want to be exposed
it is not ming it is tong
what about rugs i thought we were stopping at mansour
but you are going through with it
yes yes it is just  you know i have never been the first wife rex was married before me
so what
miles is different he is still so idealistic
well that is about to change big time
he has no cynicism or anger for once i am not the repository of rage at some other woman
soon you will have your own rage
i guess
you ruined my life you sonofabitch gimme those
when you have a moment
please no calls i am feeling very fragile
i am sorry mr massey but i felt certain you would want to know  marylin rexroth wants to see you
marylin rexroth when does she 
she is here now
sam is sam he is taking up fly fishing he is in a yert in montana
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation
my client has ruled that out
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice
that is delusional
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order
ha ha
heh heh
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets
why only fifty percent ruth why not ask for a hundred percent
oh brother here we go
why not a hundred and fifty percent
yes maybe you are right miles maybe we are being too conservative seventy five percent
kirshner does not apply kirshner was in kentucky
rephrase mrs rexroth have you ever been in love
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle they do not like the way you operate they helped her
he never ate the prenup did he
i have no idea what howard doyle eats i am not a damn dietician
did marylin end up with money
do not give me that crap that is my crap
and it is good
i will have you suspended i will have you disbarred
do not threaten me miles i did nothing illegal
why did she do it ruth why
we have outlined a settlement
rex please
now rex
that is her job you have to respect that
gotcha no need to get anatomically correct with me rex
seems like there's more of it than ever before 
not in court you cannot has she retained counsel
i am not sure
and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities
please  let me handle this okay ruth forget kirshner  that is your bottom line
she always looked out for me
and she had private investigators assisting her
she brought my digestive enzymes
in anticipation of making you sick
maybe i should reconsider my
i am very sorry
am i mentoring the wrong mentee
no you are not
i could be mentoring kramer kramer clerked for scalia
what are they
berry spoons
ah but is she richer than mrs croesus
she could buy and sell you ten times over
i would stay away from her miles
i know you would wrigley but would kramer
the plastic surgeon i read about you in la style
do you have it
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well 
the judge is here over here judge munson
 the coin
hard to believe i know i am sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters
you were never invited to meet your soninlaw
no uh uh i do not think so hmm no well no
of course of course she was married what else would she be single i do not think so
who's patty
three is not farrow
who's rex's guy
muriel rumsey
maybe next time
she is keeping his name and one of his planes and all seven of his children
and only two are hers

hightop nike crosstrainers with heel support and aircushioned soles  they are nasty
i have new dreams now
i do not accept that
maybe one day  after you have been married twenty years you will understand
it is impossible
it is what she asked for it is what i am going to do
she was being symbolic  what if she asked you to fly to the moon
you would be visiting me at nasa
i will make it
why did you take the back roads here  they are not safe  you would know that if you would planned
maybe later
you should definitely have children  they are really special
how serious is it
i will not let you die
put out a pbs or whatever it is called
a couple days to a few months if untreated
thank you
no i just do not want anybody dying because i did not say something when i had the chance
you need a ride preacher
that is enough
it can but it will have to wait in line
routine i assure you  i just wanted to gage my health  am i healthy
yes  you are
i am going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar
you do
i have seen it before
you have
no  how far in one attempt  that is the farthest someone like myself could walk
there was no card
it is just a regular day
honey i told you  if it makes you happy we should just do it
it is a tremendous amount of work  moving
we can do it together
i do not follow
sometimes people need to see things done for them  because sooner or later they do not believe the words anymore
you do not think i love you
you are talking to me
why do you polish it
there's no reason
show me
i will  i promise
you like to take walks
no  but i want to take a walk with you
please tell me
i have changed my mind
you cannot change your mind
you have just decided is that right
please not 'the two kinds of people' speech
face it ellen i am not the type of person who reads bedtime stories but you love me anyway
do not be so sure
do not bring it in here  it probably has all kinds of diseases
it will make it
he is plastered
that is okay  really it is
i think it is a different place for each person
did you have a dream
go to sleep ellen
no really if god takes us away from each other you know where to look now
if i had seen you  by the way i am sorry about your wife  they told me
thank you i am sorry you had to lie  it must have been difficult
pacifica california
from where
philadelphia pennsylvania
i see
most certainly
and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them
that is a reasonable assumption
i do not want my wife's soul having any doubts
doubts  about what
about my love for her
his name is maurice  he is dancing around everything else
red flag man
not our problem
why so vague  why so evasive  he could be somebody hot
not our problem
if he is half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jackasses
maurice and ellen parker it was issued in philly mr maurice parker has come a long way from home  why
parker  right  get on the horn with philly  call me here
that is all right is not it
jumped where
out of the car  he jumped out of the god damn car
i am isaac i am three
i am maurice parker i am much older than three  are your parents home
is that right
you know what i am just little now but i will be big soon
you will probably be bigger than your brothers
you know what i remembered you were here and i woke up
you tell stories
oh no i am not good at that very bad in fact
who's telling this story
making the grand total
what was that
perhaps there's another route
umm no  it is just that 
god damn you are right you do not say much michelle but what you say is golden
umm coalville utah
you are amazing
it has to be a full character's name
pulitzer here i come
never have children  if they are not a burden to you they are a burden to someone else
write from your heart  that is why the classics are great
no  no i will not be here for a while  the store will be closed in the interim
walking where
i always knew you had good instincts  goodbye kris  i will see you when i get back
 round the world in eighty days  hello kris
you are amazing what are you doing mr parker
i told you
pacifica california  it is a coastal city
oh a coastal city  that is good
she knew you loved her
she was not certain i never really showed her
why know
because i should have shown her before everyday i should have shown her
so i have been informed
she never ate a slice
 the grapes of wrath
you are amazing
i missed you to mr parker
adelle told me your writing is going well  the crusader for social issues and all
you were right  from the heart is always better
what come on
i cannot do it  i want you to finish but i want you to live more
i do
why in god's name did you fly all the way here then
do not do this
it is mine to risk
no more words  until i touch the ocean with my hands it is all just words
where am i
in a hospital
which hospital  did you take me back
i need your help
mr parker i am supposed to give you your fish sticks
did you tell him everything you wanted to  did you do everything you could while he was here
someone should be with you
good morning
oh that is not mine
you should  children are a blessing from god  i have four
fortyseven years
he is getting my sweater from the car  i said there was a breeze  i told him not to go
confused  i am not sure what to do now  i am not sure what he wants for me
he wants to reward you that is why i am here
what do you mean
i mean you have done a great thing you should be rewarded monetarily
what  who are you
we did a piece after your story ran in the new york times
it is yours
this is not right
precisely  faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant
then we smash 'em
anything left for smashing you may happily smash
i have something far more pleasant awaiting me
purely a precaution
no  smashing is not required  i have a surprise for our tiny invaders raise that hatch
i doubt the faeries will admire their beauty come this will be fun to watch
indeed the best of fun enjoy yourselves
this is another victory my friends what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress
you go to lady now
to finish last evening's delightful work
what do you want with me
your love
your words sting more sharply than your whip
i speak of love and you think only of the lash
but i am hideous
you are magnificent
grotesque monstrous
you should glory in your animal nature  it is your triumph  none know that better than i
not from me surely
you you are a beast
we are all of us beasts my dear only most are afraid to show it
and you are you not also afraid
i am afraid of nothing
then why hide behind a mask  you are ashamed
i know no more of shame than i do of fear  i wear this mask not for concealment but protection
i prefer to think more like the sagacious owl
do you feed on mice and rats
i prefer a plump capon but will happily serve you rats if they are to your liking
why have you brought me here
to be my bride of course
i would soon die
we are both of us damned my beauty
do it now
no  now is the time for discipline some lessons in obedience for the future baroness
kill me i want so nice
why should i kill you  a simple course in etiquette something your parents sadly overlooked
what do you want from me
at the moment very little  your company at my table
oh yes
a few day's nourishment will see your strength returning
and then
when you are ripe for my pleasure i will enjoy the harvest
i see
i am pleased you are not troubled by the prospect
do as you wish with my body you will never possess my soul
your soul  why should i bother with such a paltry trifle
i do not expect you would understand
indeed i am my dear that makes us a pair
it is nothing  my men take great delight in routing the enemy  do not trouble yourself beauty
it sounded like it came from the courtyard
from the parapets most likely  the men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving
might we watch too
later beloved now i wish only to be with you
pleasure is for those who seize it do you think those insipid pale skinned mortals will ever know such rapture
now i want to live forever  i have never felt so strong or happy
or looked so beautiful
yes  i feel that too  weakness is what is ugly
precisely my darling  your animal strength your primitive power has surfaced you are what you desire
to be strong and free that is all i desire
i did not know i 
what  speakee loud  no hear velly good
i said i mean no harm i thought this as empty tomb
you come stealee tleasoo
oh no never nothing like that never crossed my mind
no need lie boy  i no hurt you do i look like i wanna hurt you
well er no  i mean you do not look like dragons i have heard of
course not  i no flum here  i come flum cathay
east of mercia
dlagon not like that  dlagon is spilit of life spilit of stlength and goodness
it is terrible
ang how you do it  how you rift cuss
i need your help  in order to fight blackheart i must wear the armor of achilles  i 
you come stealee tleasoo
oh no do not you understand
no more listening  your time is at an end insignificant whelp
or was it the time you and jimmy squarefoot stole the golden apples i would forged
gump is it
aye honeythorn gump come to serenade you jack come to make you dance
i am in no mood for dancing
oh but you will be jack think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night adancing
faerie ring
to be sure
dance jack  the night's but begun
you will have a long long rest in the tomb me lad
i meant no disrespect
did not you now  well then answer me this riddle and all be forgiven
and if i cannot
why jack then tis your death song i will be strumming
a riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you are thirsty for wine
well spoke  true to the mark  and if it is wine you are wanting it is wine we shall have
i am honored honeythorn gump but no more tricks
you have me word lad  to answer a faerie riddle deserves as much
twas the princess lili gave me the answer have you seen her by chance
i have laid eyes on no mortal but you this day jack
i fear she is lost
it looks er delicious  such a fine bouquet very aromatic
generally known  what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots
please do not misunderstand  i am grateful for your hospitality and 
he is afraid of enchantment  will you listen to the fool prattle on
big question that lad  why what
why has this happened to the world why is it winter now and dark
aye  honeythorn gump would be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer
do not you know
if you are looking for enchantment jack that i can give thee
if ye want more tricks i am your man but for big questions ye must go elsewhere
do not you care about that is happened
true but it will not come easy or free  if ye want to ask ask jenny greenteeth
jenny greenteeth  who's she
aye  on the morrow we go but tonight   tonight is for making merry
aye  that foul wallow be where jenny greenteeth dwells  oona lure her out  play the part of a girlchild
what do i do
do not get caught that is what she will suck your bones like honey comb
fie on what she thinks  you mind her claws and teeth cast your spell oona
lamentable news jack but tis the fate of the living concerns us now
did you hear  twas the killing of the unicorn caused it
aye  black barongs mischief
if the horn be restored the curse is ended
time for a champion  can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests jack
i will do what i have to do for princess lili's sake
bravely spoke  you have the heart of a champion true enough
twill take more than heart  where do we find the armor of achilles for a start
i know where to find it  taking possession be another matter
have we turned graverobber then
a tomb it once was boy and a tomb it may yet be there's another in residence at lindfarne now
and who might that be
no less a creature than the lindfarne worm
you do the praying  i have work ahead
there's the spirit lad  if ye run into trouble give a yank here and we will haul ye up
that is left of me how do i recognize the armor of achilles
better we eat him than the other way round
no false modesty lad  you are a proper champion  achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit
something's coming
it would appear so
careful lad
the colt's still too small
aye  that too
you will need more than bird droppings for blackheart
i will drop a cow on the knave
drop a mountain on him and we will not need our troops
we march on castle couer de noir within the hour
how do you plan on finding this here castle if ye do not mind me asking
aye  and hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying
whatever for
jenny greenteeth said  follow the raven in her flight
aye  said to follow it to the edge of night  but is this the right bird
i am sure  it spoke to me
birds speak to me all the time what did it say
send oona up above the tree tops she be our eyes
good plan that
foul fellow this couer de noir
the foulest  mayhap i can cut them free
jack do not
what know you of fields of war
well if the knight be already dead what harm is there in borrowing a thing or two
stealing his arms
that would be devil's needle  last landmark i know in these woods
nay jack tis not what you are thinking
i trust our own welcome will be more hospitable
nay  that is but to distract the casual visitor  a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly
better to kill than be disturbed
pure gold it is plays a different note every time
something the matter
ogg's footprints
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet
certainly understandable
very secretive they are  keep their feet covered up  best if you do not mention it
gump you are putting words in my mouth
stoutly spoke lad  these dwarves be sore grouches pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling
tis not the sword that counts but the man what swings it  rest easy jack
god protect you honeythorn gump
your strong right arm's all the protection i will need this night
we will surely be in our graves if we do not
going grows slower we have not made half a mile in two hours
there's the way mates
it bodes evil
stay on your guard jack  the bug is enchanted surely
no thank the lord but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite
easily said the raven passed this way hours ago
heading true north  we continue in that direction
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course
we will trust in faith gump
aye lad we have little else to go by
long as we do not lose heart jack
we will never find the barongs castle
nay  this time we strike first
nay  i show no pity to imps and fiends
i know the rogue jack  tis jimmy squarefoot
but seem to have gotten lost on the way
no but what choice have we
the chill is worse this night
it is your own fear troubles you we are here are not we  for all the dark magic protecting it
it feels wrong jack like a trap
there's more than one way to spring a trap
aye so long as you are not too greedy for the bait
on the morrow i will be awake enough to see if dreams come true
pray they do not turn out to be nightmares
we will need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders
why not mine the damned walls
we do both  our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under
defend ourselves  we have bested far worse already
easily spoken
never mind  just do it  retrieve the arrows somehow
and frog do not fly and bite like tomcats  it be magic jack powerful ogre's magic
there is not much time
been telling you that all along lad
what magic have we on our side
faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power we have ogg's gifts the key and the 
there must be some way to get it up there
that is it
aye  before the wee pesties attacked
then it is godspeed screwball
fire away
best get down close to the moat lad
aye  we are good as inside
it is what we will find there worries me
nonsense  course it matters
 the princess lili i have killed her
the wound is mortal
nay  you have not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine
can you save her
easily the question is can we save ourselves  be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war
i do not understand
because sunlight will kill him quickly now give me the key
sunlight you say
aye  hurry now gump the key
mean you to seek him out below
i am not afraid of the dark
i admire your valor jack  by all means seek him out but first we needs visit the kitchen
nay lad we are here to collect a weapon you will need fighting the baron
what weapon
easier than that jack  screwball  fetch me down a couple of them plates
patience lad
ah but you will  and so will the baron when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway
tis a delicate operation lad requires a bit of engineering next
do not get too far
hurry up
never show mercy
i could have struck off his head just now
he will not escape me
you are on your own like a true champion
i have not heard a note out of you
not in the mood i am afraid
listen to him  not in the mood
on a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen a day so fair as forty springtimes 
i am not denying it is a joyous day 
where is your joy if you cannot sing
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst
she lives is not that worth singing about
she lives like all the world before the barongs curse lifted  now the world's reborn yet still she sleeps
go on go on
she tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it  said she would marry me if i did
and did you
nay  it was lost  when i came up for air the pond was frozen over
that is it then the ring
i will try
you are good at riddles find the ring and the spell is broken
hush up screwball  do your own wormsticking if you like the taste so well
nay  jack's the dragonslayer ai not you jack
wolfslayer wormsticker give a cheer for the champion
no no no this is different
these chaps will need a woodpecker to pick their teeth
screwball  be quiet  we have friends live 'neath the needle they will no doubt provide safe refuge for the night
gonna make ogrestew
three cheers for our champion
very thrifty  even got your arrow back
they have fired the moat
you will do it because i am you liege and i command you to do it
rise screwball and into the basket with you
nay sire i will cling to it as to life itself
good lad here jack give me a hand with the windlass there's a good fellow
they will do nicely
oh jack you are a wild man to use me so
if you like
i may have said perhaps
oh fie  what about the unicorn
all right  i will show you something sacred
stop complaining
a gentleman would offer water
only were he a fool to boot  see yon viper
i detest serpents
that viper has envenomed the water no animal will drink here now
what shall we do
be patient
that is the matter
do not leave me now  i fear the unicorn will not show himself without you
i am not its master
the napkin will keep  i would rather not be alone
your command is my wish princess lili
in these woods you are a commoner now be quiet  true royalty approaches
they rival the angels of paradise
oh jack might not i touch one  it would thrill me so
are you honest
he will not flee if i show myself
not if you be chaste  tis an awesome test of virginity
i have no fear of failure  your implications are most unbecoming
i am not your judge nor have i any desire to witness the trial
to fetch your napkin
i do not know  they have hurt the unicorn
damned hunters  it was a trap and you were the bait
my own father
how bad was the unicorngs wound
it happened so fast  he was hurt and ran away
he did run
oh yes and the mare with him
good  they will never catch him there's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn
i do not want it on me
its powers are strong
i do not want to be reminded of what happened
do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood
jack green jack you must not flatter me so
tis the truth
a maid must beware of flattery methinks you want to kiss me
there's no happier thought under heaven
if i were your bride would the kissing ever stop  do you wish to marry me jack
my lady mocks me
nay jack i am but wary of your intentions
my heart intends no more than that you love me as i do you
oh la
let it  have not you a cozy bower we might hide in
tis not fit for a princess
be it fit for your wife green jack
i have no wife
then perchance you will me
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride
do you wish it jack  wish you this our wedding band
what if i answer yes  will my wish come true
jack forgive me
only that is right
i was bewitched it is better this way
they told me you were dead
you have freed me jack
it is the barongs damnable work  too cowardly to stand and fight he used you to save himself
no it is not you he is afraid of it is light
so he is hiding in the dark
in the dark where i join him
no  do not let go you must not  i love you
and i love you
whilst you were sleeping i fetched your ring
i cannot have been under much more than a minute
seemed like weeks and weeks  such a terrible dream i could never tell you
is what you said about the ring but another dream
oh no dearest jack i meant every word
you are teasing still
lili i love you
and i love you my husband
ouch  something's biting me
biting you
pinching me
pinching  where
everywhere  ow
i cannot see a thing
ow  whatever it is it hurts
grand champion is it  and what great cause leads you to me
we seek the ogre baron couer de noir  he slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter
thought the weather terrible of late
his feet shall never cross my lips
another hero's handmedown thurgis note the armor tis greek work
they call me green jack ma'am
come closer then jack that i might give you proper thanks
your fair smile be thanks enough better i stand afar to admire your beauty complete
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you
the moon is too round of face methinks
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross  all the heavenly angels must envy your grace
i like well your conceit jack  tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world
why then there thou hast  we be lucky worse has not befallen us
couer de noir  a demon if the devil ever made one
he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot
follow the raven in her flight follow old black wing to the edge of night
not very precise directions
come sit beside me sweet boy and i will draw you a map
nay  tempting as your invitation be  tell me one thing more
ask away sweet man
what became of the princess
princess  i know of no princess
princess lili godwings daughter she was with me when calamity struck but after i could find no trace of her
is she fair this princess
exceeding fair
as fair as me
twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky
she is dead
i do not believe you
far as you are concerned she is dead believe it or not
do not be sad jack not with me here to give you cheer
tis not the time to speak of cheer
you will visit again
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom
what a fine meal you would make be the rest of you sweet as your tongue
i pray god grants it me
then i would kiss you without turning my garments insideout and sewing bells all over
no need for bells jack  i will nay enchant ye
no fear of that now
then tis not for chastity methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night
i would be honored
only that
and charmed of course
fie  do not speak of charms  i should charm you for being so dull witted
i had no thought of offending you oona
do i not please you jack
in every way
and am i not fair
wondrously so
then why do you speak sweeter words to jenny greenteeth
that was in jest
jest with me then
how so
tell me i am fair as you did the hag
you are fair as the first new flower of spring
and sweet
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind
pray you be sweet as your words dear jack
a faerie's love makes anything possible
i am promised to another
what shape i take matters not  long you for another  i will give you your heart's desire
you you you mortal you
i would build a wall around me with such stone so the likes of you might never enter
be fair oona
you beware jack  you and your porridgepot heart
heading north still
true north  straight up that pass through the net
i know where to find him he lies out on the marsh ravenfodder his horn torn from his head
we wait
i think she is about to foal
watch behind or i will never collect on it
small miracles better than no miracles
of course they are alive  all nature is living
come on gump let's have a look at this witchcraft
his honor i suppose seeing he no longer can defend it
bah  you faeries have the morals of ferrets
have not heard a bird sing in days
or a kite  we could make a kite let the wind do the work 
done like a champion  can you reach me with the line
it is done we will never catch him
no speeches  that is a little swim after sticking worms and ogres
i slew the lindfarne worm with it
sigurd the volsung slew fafnir with that blade see the line where regin welded the break
achilles wore it before the gates of troy
you are well equipped i would say legendary arms
may god protect you
i am sending you back to hell
yes yes jimmy squarefoot good friend to one and all
the black baron you say
jimmy squarefoot no lost
castle couer de noir built with magic simple as death strong as hate
you do know where it is
to castle couer de noir
you follow
a castle's but stone and mortar 
nay  castle couer de noir is devil's work built with sorrow and grief

i am not armed  well
why is it wrong to run
you should not even think such things  and you picked a strange person to say them to 
i suppose but what if you want to live

a runner gave it to me

of course 
if you trusted me you would know
we are coming to arcade  shall we relive together
you are not going are you

insane nurseries are better than any mother could be
i am only telling you what i have heard  have not you ever wondered what your seedmother was like
when did you begin to question lastday
i do not remember exactly except i was a green  what would you like to relive logan

where sanctuary can you take me there
logan i do not know where sanctuary is but if i take you to them they will kill you
all right but why i did not kill the runner
yes but they will not know that or care they are hunting you logan maybe me too now
that is nothing there's a sandman behind us too and there will be more soon take me to them
i  i cannot
then  why do not you leave me  go to them  explain
no not that either
yes  i do not know what else to do  with him following us  why do you keep running from your 
because he is my friend   and i do not want to be killed by him  or anyone
he is good is not he
i would rather take my chances with them than with francis
they will not listen
you think sandmen will  there's no other way for me
we will convince them
they are watching us now they will let us in when they are sure
why jessica you are still a green
it is the only way
some kind of breeding pens i suppose they say people used to breed animals fish anything  to eat of course
ycch  to kill things and then eat them it must have been a savage world
it is brighter there besides we cannot go back
you are really one of us now are not you
you knew that i was not before did not you  why did you stay with me
i wanted to  and you what made you kill sandmen
i had to i did kill for the first time in my life i killed
because you felt like a runner did not you
it feels like breath it makes everything move your hair is moving
and yours
we will be all right  we will
sooner or later we will have to try something
why do not we rest here we know we can eat these
i doubt it
do not ever let go
i will not
do you think he was telling the truth
thirty thousand years did not last very long did they
the lifeclocks have no power outside
you know jessica
but i still have the choice
of course
then the answer's yes
beloved husband beloved wife what can all that mean
it could be
he had a mother and father  and he knew them

you want there to be one that does not
there has to be i know it exists it has to
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes
we cannot we are going back

sanctuary is the right to live nothing more but nothing less either
beloved wife
it is part of the hydrogalvanic system the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow

mother and father said so you know
i do not know
you are both full of secrets like macavity  did you steal this

what people
i do not know but it does
that is that

at least it is over
we will remember but that is a long time off

shall we go inside i should so like to show you some of our rare treasures
we follow many
oh good heavens no
how do you deal with incorrigibles criminals

suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he did not give a hang if it was good manners or not
well it must have taken
buy and  sell no no pardon me exchange 
you are startled
oh no just a little bowled over that is all
why mr conway you surprise me

why not she is an attractive young woman
not for years shangrila will keep her youthful indefinitely
suppose she should leave it
leave shangrila that is not likely you could not drive her out
no i mean about her appearance if she should leave the valley  what would happen
oh she would quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age
it is weird  chang how old are you
i cannot let him go alone it is suicide
i have offered you some warm broth i thought perhaps
you get out of here if any of you men think you can come busting in here
i do not need any advice from you get me a doctor

no doctors  that is fine that is just fine
please let me help you

i guess i lost
you got smeared
and goodwill toward man
no just peace on earth

sir  i thought those records were sealed
we are the government cowan
what happens if i say no
it will make sense later
no but you will get used to it    welcome to the men in black
further what are you talking about air  that makes no sense i hold three cadet class records
actually it did not come from me
then where did it  sir  forgive me but it makes no sense worked my ass off to grad
cowan  do you ever think that maybe just maybe other people might be right and you might be wrong

we are rising
the pentagon
i dunno man  maybe we should
what if he is telling the truth
you know something  i actually never think of that  i gotta get some coffee
yes  well in his own mind yeah  what if from his point of view he is
how does that help me
well if you think about it then it would mean that maybe everything he is saying is true
i know what you are saying  and i am telling you i do not trust him
i know you do not trust him  you do not trust anybody
since as long as we have been keeping records
for how long
well if the bugs have hatched and they are not here then where are they
all of it
i would double it and add 20
right  oh and here
actually it is a shotgun  hold onto it
in case i need it
in case i need it
getting eaten that was your plan
and i almost got digested it goes with the job

forget that guy 
do it  right here  on the ground
he will turn around
he will not
anderton leave
what is it
i cannot leave  you said so yourself there is no minority report  i do not have an alternative future
but you still have a choice  the others never had a chance to see their future  you did
someplace safe
i have to go back
you want to spend the rest of your life in the temple
i am going back  i see myself there
who wanted her little girl back
the drowning woman  anne but it was too late  her little girl was already gone
she died
she grew up
she is still alive
oh jesus
then who was he
just some guy they found
found  where
because i found out about her
about who
anne lively
i know i do too
how did i not see this  agatha who killed you mother  who killed anne lively
i know that but i wanna keep the old ones
it is all i could safely move
we know each other
oh yes
baltimore  eastside  solomon p eddie md  i was a plastic surgeon
yes you did
you made those tapes
they were performance pieces

i cannot even stand up 
i know you are in a hurry so i juiced up the nanoreconstruction around your new eyes
the nano what
yes sir  i am gideon  the music relaxes the prisoners
no you are not in trouble  i am interested in a murder
kill type
this is the official composite of the three precogs
that is right  it is a combined data stream based on all three previsions
show me just agatha's data stream
for that we have to go for a ride
i work graveyard swing and day all by my lonesome
 graveyard shift
not to mention saved by the bell
on account of those are not his eyes  he had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners
try again
just tell me about the intended victim  this anne lively
do not worry lamar
the nation votes this week
hang on lamar 
lamar i am sorry  i do not know what 
do not apologize john
yes sir
tuck in your shirt
so give him a tour  he does not know enough to ask the right questions
if he is looking for a flaw in the system 
he is not  he is looking for a flaw in us john
i am fine
i hear you have been spending a lot of time in the sprawl
i go running down there
in the middle of the night
i am fine lamar
we will not let them
no  how is an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them
justice already knows  talk to me john  tell me that is happening
this is all witwer  he is setting me up
stop  just wait  who's the victim
somebody named leo crow
and who the hell is that
i am out of breath  i am a fucking fugitive
then come to my house  we will talk 
i cannot  they are following me right now  they will meet me there they will halo me
how could witwer have accessed the case file
can you fake the cerebral output
i am not getting halo would
you cannot run 
everybody runs
beauty  the precogs do not even always agree with each other
no doubt
then go ahead pull the trigger
armor up  sicksticks and concussion guns  this is gonna be close
you are kidding that is today
i wrote it down in your calendar then left a message at your house 
get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside
i show a cop on horseback
everybody runs
you do not have to do this chief
you do not have to chase me fletcher
red ball  double homicide one male one female  killer's male white 40's
run the subscription list
no maglev system
the mall
yeah  so
now look at him
did he close the front door
we are in motion on something
nope  somebody's thinking about this one
amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that
check ncic maybe he is got a record  then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location
that was easy
any id on the shooter yet
still scrubbing looks like there's a third party somebody wearing shades just out the window
sure chief  i think i will grab one for myself while i am at it
take your time
your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office
they did  make yourself comfortable  we will be back in an hour
you mind if i tag along
yes it is
because it was going to fall
you are certain
then why cannot they see rapes or assaults or suicides
speaking of interfacing i would love to say hello
to hineman
cops are not allowed inside the temple
really  you have never been inside
we keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering
so i will be the first one to go in then
maybe you did not hear me
if it is a question of authority
there's no question  you do not have any
i have a warrant in my pocket that says different
the precogs are pattern recognition filters nothing more
but you call this room the temple
just a nickname
i will write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night
you gonna tell on me
possession alone will cost you six months not to mention your badge
nothing she grabbed me and then there was an image on the screen
it could have been a nightmare sometimes they dream about the old murders
to you  i do not think so  what would she say
she said
do i know you  who are you
there's no way of knowing for sure she could have forgotten whatever it is you are looking for
okay  fine  where the hell is that
well hey you did not have to come all the way down here  for you chief i make housecalls
i need help with her
well hello there honeypie
she is a precog
that is right
rufus for christ's sake get up
they do not belong to anybody
then take her to radio shack
i guess that is all of it
uh i will try
that is great
what a big boy  how old are you
i love you too  i love you daddy  love ya dad
are you kidding  there's absolutely positively no way on my best day i could ever beat twelve seconds
come on
all right i will try
you gotta have faith dad
it is a little late for that
wanna hear something funny
what the hell
no  he got tired of pretending
oh sean 
the funny thing is i started to believe he really was my dad
i forgive you
once i even told him i loved him
i forgive you
the more you want to believe something the easier it is to be fooled
i was looking for you
goodbye dad
i am your son  i am you
sean wait
hold your breath dad
did i  i do not recall i got lots of kids from that place 
some  somebody's father
his name was sean  six years ago francis pool
i put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay
the precogs were wrong
if you do not kill me my family gets nothing
who said i would
crow  i am not gonna kill you
look believe me i know it is hard but you gotta do it 
i am asking you again who made you do this
fake  he gave it to me  now    shoot me goddammit before i lose my nerve
tell me who was it set this up
if i tell you my family gets nothing
who made you do this
kill me
tell me
you are not gonna kill me
goodbye crow
i am a little dizzy
the what
the vine  the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall
you can tell me how someone could fake a prevision
and how would i know that
i am not  i was trying to heal them not turn them into something else
heal who
the innocents we now use to stop the guilty
you are talking about the precogs
you think the three in the tank come from a test tube  they are merely the ones who survived
and yet a chain of events has started  a chain that will lead inexorably to his death
not if i stay away from him
how can you avoid a man you have never met
so you will not help me
i cannot help you  no one can  the precogs are never wrong
because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur
i am saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might just might have an alternate future
does burgess know about this about the minority report
yes of course he knew but at the time he felt  we both felt their existence was an insignificant variable
i believe in that system
do you  really
hold that thought
why should i trust you
the safest place of all
 and then walk out
actually i think you will have to run out but yes that is what you have to do
you are insane or you think i am
sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark
it is always in the more gifted of the three
which one is that
the female
oh god what did you do
nothing  i did not kill him
then how did he 
no it is not lamar  there was nothing anyone could do
you look great
i thought you were retiring
i do not know who that is
we know why john was tagged

what does he want with a precog
what do you think  so he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it

no a little there's a lot of debate about it
oh a lot of things several different factors will you see her doctor mumford

i am fine
you are the shrink are not you
no not really
but you do therapy
not any more
ernest what do you think
i think he is got a point
so the university of kentucky who runs the program down there
it could happen what about his state certification exams the records seem to be in order
oh for god's sake phyllis  we have no reason to doubt the man are we listening to lionel now
no dr delbanco it is i who am sorry sorry to have wasted your time with such
i do not think you know dr sheeler she is the other therapist here in town
of course i have heard great things about you
right now
are we
i think i have heard of him a disciple of rothberg was not he
dorothy fowler fantastic woman she passed last year in a train wreck damned amtrak
my approach
and please for whatever small way i may have encouraged this accept my apologies  there is good news though
that is that
as you can imagine my own feelings about this are mixed unlike i must say those of my wife
i do not want to hear any more today
why not
mr follett do you trust me or do not you
well i do not know i only been seeing you 
without trust there's no point to any of this you might as well not come
now hold on i did not say i did not want to come 
good then go
mr follett
 'cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixengs smile and i knew 
why i am paying for this
not for this not me you are not
you find it distasteful do not you
it does not matter how i feel about it it is how you feel about it that matters
i enjoy it does that make me some kind of pervert just because a man has a rich imaginative life 
you did not come to me because you have a rich imagination
i never said that
go to hell
i did not hear you
now we are back on track
you are so mean
it is a thought i had
should i open it now
what exactly is it supposed to do
you remember when i asked you about pornography 
 i find it degrading maximum gynecology and minimum turnon 
but you did come to me
there's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you i am embarrassed to have 
me too doc and i cannot tell you what that package meant to me 
my name's gilroy i am from the state certification board
no thanks plenty of time for that when we are a little further along
mr gilroy 
doc nice to meet you

we have been talking about her mostly
a little
no i mean about althea about her  behavior do you think you can fix her up
what do you think's wrong with her
she is gone weird is that is wrong with her out of control probably from living out here in mayberry
she seems very unhappy
i do
do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people
are you disrespecting this court mr white
no sir i was empathizing sorry
i would better get in there
that is a lot of people all at once
it is okay they preorder there's a choice of three entrees
what are they
salad nicoise i love salad nicoise

and it is the hubble telescope not the himball telescope
thanks for your help lionel

i just got my license two weeks ago
you are good
i been driving since i was twelve
that would explain it
can you help mom
i am trying
got to
is she a friend of yours
insane did not ja hear my family got five hundred times better  let's go vanessa
mumford like the town
we are going for a walk
do you think that is a good idea
dr mumford does yes i have put myself completely in his hands for today anyway
what kind of doctor are you
mother go away
oh not a real doctor
that is right the fake kind
there's something i think we need to talk about
what do you mean
i think you know what i mean
no i really do not
i think you do
why do not you tell me
why do not you go to hell it is all a bunch of nonsense and you know it
 the problem is you are a big fake you have not got a clue that is wrong with that girl
take a hike dr quack
good evening mrs cook
just who is here can you tell me
could i see sofie please
no you can not i would not know who to say is calling
well i gotta say mrs cook you are right about that
hmm as in  that is interesting sometimes with enough clues it is possible to figure these things out
even if you do not think it is real
we we would try several things but i need to see you a lot
i do not know i barely made it today
i will come to you we will try a little walking
i do not think i can afford it i do not want my dad paying
we will work it out
no one ever thought so you must bring it out
is it contagious 'cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down
maybe you will catch it
we will turn back anytime you want
oh boy this should be interesting
people usually have to get to know me before they hate me
is that the technical description of what i have got
is she against you getting help
we do not discuss it
something's bothering her
you have got a funny idea of funny
i have offended you
sorry i am done
'cause i will tell you none of the others have tried this approach
be specific
yes yes and definitely yes also i get confused
yeah most people have that it is confusing here
did you get headaches before this  but you get more now or more severe
no not really they are about the same my marriage was one long headache
so the headaches may not even be a part of this
is that like a party trick
well then my life has been some kind of huge rip
i do not know if i am going to make it the whole way
it does not matter go on
oh there's something wrong with you all right especially after hearing that dream of yours about the rotorooter
it is pretty obvious to a trained professional
brady peck's fourteen years old lives next door
and he is where
in the capitol for boy's nation five days why
it is all right
then you can expect me at 530 tomorrow morning
and this is legitimate therapy
therapy hell no i just do not want to do it alone
which thing
either one
why would you come to the house the other night
i thought i had something to tell you but it turned out i did not
my brother said you were about to fire me
that is one way to put it
of course
is something wrong sofie
yes something's very wrong dr mumford
you are upset
how intuitive that must take years of training right there maybe you can guess what has upset me
given that i am obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way
i do not follow you
which show was that
you probably got the idea
you are not the only one
not me all my other my patients i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here
you deserve it
i know it please believe me i know that
i do not know depends i am in a bad mood
i love you more than i have ever loved anyone or anything in my life
anything just ask
what is your name
will you wait for me
we are only talking about six weeks
will you be here
of course i have not got the energy to get out of town that fast
in maybe three or four issues
weekly or monthly
monthly god how shallow do you think brad is why do i waste my time telling you this stuff
why do you think you tell me nessa
do not do that thing  that shrink thing
it is a big part of the show
it is called pro bono
pro boner  pro bono huh for whose good supposedly
it is my bit for the community
have women found you attractive
what do you want me to see
just chill for a second look at this guy it appears he is actually dead but gorgeous
if you do not want to have a session today it is okay
what are you talking about
was it something that happened at school
these appointments were not my idea remember
true should we stop them
he said  which we already knew

it is just a thought
 skip knowing what you do about me 
jerking off
sexual surrogate slash companion

lonnie it is a complex procedure why do not you observe
i am not some snotnosed resident fresh out of medical school blake
how do you do mr mccord we are trying to locate a deranged fan of yours a ms betty
deranged that would be the right word
more than you know is there anything else
no that should be more than 
georgia in case i did not tell you it is cash only gentlemen
you know it is interesting the south lost the civil war but they still seem to get all the glory
even robert e lee was a loser
he going crazy on us or what
did you know the most brutal inhumane prison of the entire war was in georgia
really and where was that old man
andersonville  they did horrible things to men there
you are a hundred percent right they rely on that ishisname's arm too much
oh yes with the coffee
yep betty pours a pretty mean cup
ahh my wife's
if we are for real
you do not exactly look like drug dealers
it is a nice place you got here real comfortable sweet little town fair oaks you like it here
are you kidding me that is to like
of what
i am asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck
i do not follow
you are not a dumb fuck are you del
the indians injuns whatever they are always drunk and doing stupid things
like what
driving their cars into trees puking on the sidewalk stupid shit
let's see around here that would be kiowa kickapoo or osage if i am not mistaken
i i do not know
and put them in your mouth
beer please
wesley  your wife's a very lovely woman have i seen her before
i am just curious cannot you give me an example
that is what i thought  you better give me another example
stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are by their very nature untrustworthy
that is so right
so you see we have totally different ideas of that is stupid and that is not do not we
you told me how to do it
that was to get him to talk  get rid of that thing will you
he told us it is in the buick
we do not know which buick do we
well why would you shoot him
i had to shoot him it was the only decent thing to do
what 'look'
that one look you got i thought you were done so i took him out
you just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this
why not it will confuse 'em gotta do something now that you fucked it up
i wanted to make a statement
i am a yankee myself massachusetts
actually i scalped him and then you killed him
should i kill him now
wait any last words general lee
well no one ever spit in my face before especially some cracker fuck
you have to rise above it the professionals rise above that kind of thing
i know i am let's just do what we gotta do here and get the fuck gone
you think so joyce says she is timid
joyce was screwing del
among others
i would say that about torches her credibility would not you
so what the fuck's a finn
no like a worthy adversary wesley like a very worthy adversary
well then did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband
she is got class and poise lots of poise
and turn that fucking music off
i am sick of looking at her mother fucking face
i do not know but when we find her she is gonna die for it
you know blonde thin whatever
not so fast slower 'blonde thing yes did they say she had style a kind of grace or anything
no be dark before we get there you wanna see the grand canyon at night
yes i am and we are not going act professional
where where is she
i am not telling
maybe she had to use the bathroom she pees does not she
well i think i saw her soul
what does not
you gimme this bullshit psychic friends theory you believe that dumbshit trucker you believe this woman
i never said that i believed
i call it 'nutty' as my shit after i eat almond roca
you need to remember who you are talking to
a doctor on the show why
it just did not fit her profile
fuck the profile that is the same guy
she cannot be here because of a a soap opera not a soap opera that would make her
crazy no shit shaft and you ai not far behind
but she is no betty's smarter than that she would not be here for a
i said 'got it'
yeah i got it  come on you are stretching out my vest
you made your point  i was wrong
well you were right about what that bartender said
leave take this shit back to detroit and get the rest of our money
no i said to follow 'my' instincts now we go up there and conclude our business case closed
very graceful perfect form
betty was a lovely child
if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed it would have been me
oh five years give or take
hmm you two in high school together
are not you a sweetheart no not quite anyway she is been with us awhile
but she wanted more out of life right
if it helps bring her back be my guest
thank you for your cooperation  just one more thing did she ever talk about getting rich
who does not
huh oh umm a car  so to a successful transaction
it is if you like idiots
he is waiting
okay uh the umm injuns are stupid
i cannot tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him
she is even taken a job as a nurse  david ravell's getting boring lyla
we know that
can i have an evil twin
no george we have already done that with lonnie the blind one last year remember
oh of course who can forget the emmy  then let me bring betty to the set and see what happens
i do not know george
i will tell the cast ahead of time what do you say
i will think about it
fine but promise me one thing if we use her i want to direct those episodes she is my discovery
actually she was my discovery just like you
what the hell's going on
if you need a minute that is okay but i thought you would want to 
no let me try this
i said forget it
then do as you are told get her back
ahh mercedes i think black
yeah the sport utility
would you say she was ambitious
why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody
because it ai not natural young man
what are you talking about killing's totally natural it is dying that is not natural
look joyce i need your key to the files not advice okay this is a complex case
you would like that would not you you have hated betty since you were in pep squad together
no before that
the driver was killed i think there's a connection 
no about are you talking about duane cooley
yeah why you know him
know him we were gonna get married he was gonna leave his wife for me fuck

chickenshits they are grabbing at anything

i do not know i really do not
anamaria  have you seen gibbs  i need to put together 
safe  at port royal  with the royal navy
that boat is my livelihood
you will get it back  or one better
i will
they will be anchored on the lee side  haul your wind and keep to the weather of the island 
aye aye sir
mr gibbs organize a cleaning detail  you and cotton  i want every inch of the pearl spicand span and shipshape
she  goes  free
you have got one shot  and we cannot die
you cannot  i can
elizabeth goes free
we got that part  anything else
and jack  and the crew  free and unharmed  if you agree  then  i will remain with you
eh  you have my word then  on the good book i do swear and the lord spare my worthless soul
he did not waste it
say the name or i slit your throat
no you will not
you give me the pearl  then i tell you who you need
i am supposed to  trust you
you left me on a desert island  what worse can you do
wait as long as you like
track you down and 
bosun  set up mr sparrow's quarters nice and fine  in the brig  meaning no disrespect of course
the last time you do this you left me a pistol with one shot
you can go to your grave not knowing
that is fair
all right then
because right about now the hms dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor
what are you suggesting
that so
men  are you up for it
aye for us there is
and he is got old bill's courage a curse on him and you
by the powers you are right  where is jack's pistol  who's got it  bring it forward
turner blood does not flow pure in his veins  best play it safe and spill it all
i guess there is a reason to fret
no  but him i believe  he us genuinely angry
captain barbossa  i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal
very well
my holds are bursting with swag that bit of shine matters to me  why
elizabeth   turner  i am a maid in the governor's household 
thank you sir
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that  a family heirloom perhaps
of course  i did not steal it if that is what you mean
dare i ask the fate of it previous owner
now none of that  please dig in
then why are not you eating
would that i could
it is a pirate medallion
it is a piece of the treasure of isla de muerta
aye  and not a bit of it any use to us only hoarded  but it will drive us no longer
will  you cannot trust him
boy overboard
fetch a hook  haul him out of there
his name is will turner  that is all i found out
very good
i am a bit nervous myself 
one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness
yes i am all right i am fine  go capture him
commodore you cannot do that
you are speaking up for him again
he can locate isla de muerta  but i doubt he will be willing to help us from the brig
i am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition i rescue mr turner
not as a condition  a request
then i can wear mengs clothing
that would hardly be proper
yes  yes
is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts
or rather commodore norrington  a fine gentleman do not you think  he fancies you you know
i am told that dress is the very latest fashion in london
women in london must have learned to not breathe
about the day we met do you remember
if an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete
it would appear so do you
tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request
will how many times must i ask you to call me 'elizabeth'
at least once more miss swann as always
truthfully  you were a bit late
to keep it away from them  no pirate would sail to london for fear of execution dock
if i had known 
 then we never would have met
i guess you can never truly know someone else's heart
elizabeth i think it does not matter that we are of a different class 
it does not
 but that was not a proper kiss
miss swann if you will be so kind
i saved your life now you have saved mine  we are square
no i am  rescuing you
no  this will not work  i will stay behind and fight them you go on
the trees are taller
do not be thinking i am not already working on it
it will not  it will not and so we will not
you are right  here's luck to you will turner
what  what was that  something funny miss swann share please
nothing  it is nothing  just  i am reminded of a song i learned as a child  a song about pirates
i know a lot of songs about pirates but none i would teach a child  let's hear it
now i must hear this song  an authentic pirate song  have at it
well perhaps  with a bit more to drink i might 
more to drink
ah well  the company is better than last time  and the scenery has definitely improved
mr sparrow  i am not sure i have had enough rum to allow that kind of talk
we have got a few bottles left  and we have yet to tap the kegs
to the black pearl
yes the rum is gone
nor did you i noticed
he might delay the rescue  and that would be too late
i have a plan  if it succeeds then any battle will be decidedly brief  and onesided
that is your plan
first  have you found me a crew
not if the fool has something barbossa wants  something he needs
and you have got that have you
that he is
she can hold a bit longer
we are catching up
ah that is a dark and unpleasant tale best left untold
i know  that was for the smell
we are not going to just surrender
that we are
will  it will go worse for us  for elizabeth especially  if we fight
the wind is quarter from astern  by the time we are underway we will never catch them
we need only to come about to put them in range of the long nines
better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate
wait for my order  what the blazes is that
i do not think that will be necessary
you understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men  you will never make it out of the bay
we will see about that
as likely as not  will short up the anchor we have got ourselves a ship
sorry i did not know
no  somone has to make sure this dock stays offlimits to civilians
this must be some important boat
captain jack sparrow  if you please
we are bound for port royal not isla de muerta
they left me stranded  twice what have you got to lose
nothing i would not be please to be rid of
i knew you would listen to reason
i will be at the wheel myself
i have made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates
you threatened miss swann
only a little
i do  and i practice with them at least three hours a day
why ask me
because you are a pirate
and you want to turn pirate yourself
never  they took miss swann
how  the key's run off
we need to go
commandeer  we are going to commandeer a ship  nautical term
it is still against the law
remarkable how often those two traits coincide
aye  avast
my father  william turner
i swear you look just like him
it is not true my father was a pirate
figured you would not want to hear it
he was a merchant marine  he was a respectable man who obeyed the law and followed the rules
sure  because he could always go pirating
my father  was not  a pirate
you did not beat me  you ignored the rule of engagement  in a fair fight i would kill you
then that is not much incentive for me to fight fair is it
do not worry  i have already got a quartermaster  there
these are the only ones worth having  and we are going to need them 
this way
are you sure  jack  this is not something you have to do
it is the right way
the black pearl is a real ship
no it is not
yes it is  i have seen it
you have seen it
yes i have
and no lies
he is not telling the truth
he may be
if he were telling truth he would not have told us
mentioned it is more what he did
my apologies governor
where did he come from
an explosion in the powder magazine merchant vessels run heavily armed
no  she has not
well she had a very taxing day ghastly weather tonight
bleak  very bleak
this is l b jefferies a friend of tom's who am i talking with
oh when are they expected home
i am hired until one they went to dinner and maybe nightclubbing
he has it thank you
i will pull somebody out of japan
bryce the only man for this job is sitting right here in town  get me l b jefferies
but his leg
do not worry  it comes off today
get that idea out of your mind it will only lead you in the wrong direction
when the lock is broken  yes
did not you take it to the crime lab
that is what they call a family problem
i think you saw something  that probably has a very simple explanation
for instance
his wife took a trip
she  was  an  invalid
you told me  i have got to run jeff
all right  you do not believe me
do that
i was jaywalking
she never left the apartment 
then where is she  in the ice box
 until yesterday morning
what time
six ayem
too bad the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time
not yet
who left  where
the thorwalds  at six in the morning
jeff  huh
if possible  both
that is the matter does he have a courtesy card from the police department
a detective's nightmare
what do you need before you can search  bloody footsteps leading up to the door
you know every day for three years i asked myself that same question
ever get an answer
yeah  frequently  it ran something like this your request for transfer turned down 
oh  i almost forgot
mrs thorwald
you think he is getting out of here
everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom ready for packing
you sure it belongs to his wife
you figured that out huh
well in the garage back home we 
your logic is backward
that depends on who they were
the police department at merritsville they called to report the trunk was just picked up  by mrs anna thorwald
tom i have got something real big for you
your lisa
i know what you told me she went in to get evidence and she came out with it
like what
like mrs thorwald's wedding ring if that woman were still alive she would be wearing it
a possibility
precinct six i sent a friend over with bail money
maybe you will not need it i will run it down jeff
if that ring checks out we will give him an escort so long
for what
for getting rid of that cast
who said i was getting rid of it
gunnison  how did you get to be such a big editor  with such a small memory
wrong day
wrong week next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon
that is too bad jeff well i guess i cannot be lucky every day forget i called
did not i tell you did not i tell you it was the next place to watch
you did
okay when do i leave halfhour an hour
with that cast on  you do not
stop sounding stuffy i will take pictures from a jeep from a water buffalo if necessary
you are too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with i will send morgan or lambert
swell i get myself halfkilled for you  and you reward me by stealing my assignments
i did not ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track
you asked for something dramatically different you got it
so did you goodbye jeff
i have been taking pictures so long i do not know how to read anymore
i will send you some comic books
listen  if you do not pull me out of this swamp of boredom  i will do something drastic
like what
i will  i will get married then i will never be able to go anywhere
it is about time you got married  before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man
well  you know best call you later jeff
next time have some good news
it is me
something wrong
the word is everything now what time does my plane leave tuesday
okay indochina tuesday we will pick you up
that is more like it goodnight old buddy
who are you
for a little business meeting  to settle the estate of your late wife
i do not know what you mean
now stop wasting time thorwald or i will hang up and call the police
i only have a hundred dollars or so
that is a start i am at the brevoort now i will be looking for you
then if the police get me  you will not be around to laugh
well i only quote from the best
it crashed did not it
you have got a hormone deficiency
how can you tell that from a thermometer
those sultry sunworshipers you watch have not raised your temperature one degree in four weeks
do not you ever heat that stuff up
gives your circulation something to fight  what kind of trouble
lisa fremont
you must be kidding a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood
she expects me to marry her
that is normal
i do not want to
that is abnormal
i am not ready for marriage
she is just not the girl for me
she is only perfect
too perfect too beautiful too talented too sophisticated too everything  but what i want
is what you want something you can discuss
people with sense can belong wherever they are put
i can just hear you now get out of here you perfect wonderful woman you are too good for me
that is the hard part
intelligence nothing has caused the human race more trouble modern marriage
that is fine stella now would you make me a sandwich
how did you know
eyes bloodshot must have been staring out the window for hours
i was
what will you do if one of them catches you
depends one which one
she is real eat drink and be merry girl
and she will end up fat alcoholic and miserable
speaking of misery miss lonely hearts drank herself to sleep again alone
poor girl someday she will find her happiness
and some man will lose his
is not there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction
well the salesman could be available soon
he and his wife splitting up
it is hard to figure he went out several time last night in the rain carrying his sample case
is not he a salesman
now what could he sell at three in the morning
flashlights luminous dials for watches house numbers that light up
he was taking something out of the apartment i am certain
sometimes it is worse to stay than it is to run
but it takes a particularly low type of man to do it
no the shades are still drawn in their apartment
in this heat  they are up now
get back there he will see you
oh well yes and no it was not an official call he is just a friend  an old ornery friend
i will watch the alleyway  in case it goes that way
uhuh the dog i think i know now why thorwald killed it
and digging in  look at that flower bed
there's something buried there
i have a feeling we have just begun
you can tell that from here
i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter
would four of them  
no  but it makes the rest easy to take and she is reading the bible
then i would not worry too much but let's keep an eye on her
you do not say i might just take that compliment as an insult
got a shovel
now wait a minute 
there's no point in taking unnecessary chances  give me the phone book lisa
smart girl
smart she will be arrested
that will get her out of there will not it
stella  how long do you think he will stay there
unless he is dumber than i think he will not wait until his lease is up
to bail lisa out of jail
how much do you think you will need
first offense burglary    probably twofifty  the piggy bank
thirtythree here totals oneninety not enough
i got twenty or so in my purse give me what you have got
when those cops get a look at miss fremont  they will even contribute
not yet jeff
you have not even heard from him
not a word
i am afraid it is tess
i will have him call the moment i hear from him
he knows  do not worry tess it is a man
goodnight you idiot
goodnight mrs doyle
mmmm  hurts a little
and your stomach
empty as a football
and you love life
not too active
anything else bothering you
only because it is expected of her
 a steal at eleven hundred dollars
that dress should be listed on the stock exchange
we sell a dozen a day in this price range
who buys them tax collectors
going on right here it is a big night
it is just a runofthemill monday the calendar's loaded with them
has not been any big demand for tickets
i wanted to jeff  oh
you have perhaps an ambulance outside
fine corkscrew's on the right
well i am going to make this a week you will never forget
she looked very cool she had on a mint green 
that is good news
someday you might want to open up your own studio here
how could i run it from say  pakistan
i wish there was one i wanted
make the one you want
you mean leave the magazine
for yourself  and me  i could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow fashion portraits 
let's not talk any more nonsense huh
miss lonely hearts at least that is something you will never have to worry about
oh you can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street
she is not in love with him  or any of them
how can you tell that  from here
you said it resembled my apartment did not you
i think it is enchanting
no wonder he is having so much trouble with it
of course not
ever get shot at run over sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera
right now it does not seem so
not quite  it seems  goodbye jeff
you mean goodnight
i mean what i said
without any future
your mind is and when i want a man i want all of him
i have one now
so do i
tell me about it
not that salesmangs wife and why did not he go to work today
homework it is more interesting
that is interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper
nothing thank heaven
why has not he gone into his wife's bedroom all day
i would not dare answer that
lisa  there's something terribly wrong
something too frightful to utter
now lisa 
what is it you are looking for
i want to find out that is wrong with the salesmangs wife does that make me sound like a madman
what makes you think something's wrong with her
where is the doctor  the undertakers
she could be under sedatives sleeping  he is in the room now
there's nothing to see
you could see all the things he did could not you
what are you getting at
do not you see how silly you are being
that is the apartment house number
125 west ninth street
to get on home
all right  but that is he doing now
he was just laying all his things out on one of the beds coats suits shirts sox even his wife's 
what about it
i never saw him ask her for advise before  but she volunteered plenty
i do not know
suppose he does not come back again
he will all his things are still piled on the bed
not yet
thinking about thorwald
and you and you friend doyle   did you hear from him again  since he left
it does not make sense to me
what does not
women are not that unpredictable
lisa  i cannot guess what you are thinking
basic equipment you do not leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag
i am with you sweetie but detective thomas j doyle has a pat answer for that
that mrs thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband
that is what the witnesses told him
we will agree they saw a woman  but she was not mrs thorwald  that is yet
do not rush me we have all night
night i am going to stay with you
you will have to clear that through my landlord 
well that is fine but i only have one bed and 
lisa i will not be able to give you any 
that is a suitcase
a mark cross overnight case anyway compact but ample enough
i would be no better than thorwald to refuse
it is utterly beautiful  i wish i could be creative
you are you have a talent for creating difficult situations
i do
staying the night here uninvited
the same
but he never ends up marrying her strange
weird  why do not i slip into something comfortable
you mean  like the kitchen and make us some coffee
exactly what i had in mind  along with some brandy
who was the trunk addressed to
i think i will start reviving it tomorrow with say  miss torso for a start
no lisa  i do not think he did
thank you
well  if there was one less thread this way    and two less that way    i might give up bachelorhood
but you are not
in the whole courtyard only one person did not come to the window 
is he cleaning house
he is washing down the bathroom walls
i know but there's one important change the flowers in thorwald's pet flower bed
it could be  the knife and the saw
too close
maybe i can get thorwald out of the apartment
lisa  i  i  cannot tell you how scared i was that you  you might 
shut up i am all right
think you have got enough for a search warrant now
your name
l b jefferies
phone number
chelsea 25598
two minutes
sure i do
then you know that if i give you a little advice it will be good advice
yeah  sure
that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson i would forget it if i were you
okay mr radeau it is forgot
mr august i am not at all sure 
you cannot tell
can we go there now
sister you cannot just go breaking into places there's a night watchman down there and locks on the door
which room is it
it is the last door at the end of this hall
i would like to get out of here
you could go and open the door
then you also understand that you must die
it does not matter you want to now you should want to it is your obligation your duty
thank you
you are not a dipsomaniac at your age
no it is my father  i wanted to talk to you  you wrote about cures 
i thought you told me you did not know where she was
i am afraid she cannot do that ward it would endanger her
what sort of danger
as a man you distrust me  perhaps you believe me as a physician
she could use a hundred dollars
i will give you a check
she can only use cash
how much have you got
about fortyfive dollars
for the time being i imagine that must do
oh as beautiful as ever
she is nervous naturally under the circumstances
what circumstances
hello frances
how is miss jacqueline
i do not know that is why i came to see mrs redi i am trying to find her
you mean miss jacqueline's gone and you do not know where she is
i cannot understand it at all
but i like teaching school
redi's all right
she seems rather an odd woman to me
she is a pretty good sort
what does she do with herself after business hours
i guess most people are
thank you
i ought to know
what is it
i did her hair
what were you talking about
she was just asking about you  whether it was nice to work for you or not
and that was all
no she asked about the trademark
what did she want to know
she showed me a drawing
you	fool that symbol is us  us she was asking about us
noat the morgue they told me a mr gregory ward had made inquiries about jacqueline
the morgue no wonder you fainted  i wish you had come to me first
then you know where jacqueline is
but i would give a great deal to know
goodnight mary
but you do believe me
the important thing is the police will not believe you
but you have treated me that way
i will not do it again we are friends i will never order you about again
the people at the restaurant
oh i had business with a man but i missed him 
well i am glad you came to see me
oh i am making investigations
you have never believed a word i told you about mr august
there is a very simple way got a telephone book
last night in this very restaurant mr jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear
who the devil is he
a poet he is sitting right over there that is his table  the one at the feet of dante
things changed mary the reasons for finding jacqueline changed i want to find jacqueline to settle things
what things why
you would love that jackie remember that last summer with mother in the berkshires you used to help the gardener
good night
gregory   you would better take jacqueline with you tonight
it is what i should have done yesterday i will take her away somewhere where she can rest
no i am gladat least i have heard you say it
i do not think that is a good subject for jokes mr hoag
but i am not joking
do not be ridiculous for months i have had the best private detective in new york looking for miss gibson
but i understand her that may be more important
it may make very fine poetry mr hoag but it does not make good sense
i am looking for a party  a merry party
well that is illuminating
i do not know
i suppose so i can pick him up somewhere
verse  verse that i wrote i need it
that you love mary
not from me
i am mimi  i am dying
i am afraid
why wait
i am not going to wait i am going out  laugh dance do all the things i used to do
and then
i do not know
you will die
you know about the palladists  you know who they are  what they are i was one of them
i will not get lonely
you will have to make all the jokes because i am going to be very serious
i have something even better
but you are always at the library
i went as a detective i found out that mrs redi reads the same books as dr judd
i do not think that is so revealing
such a simple matter this figure is the symbol of the palladists
it is all clear to me now  so clear
i can imagine
but it is a small room jason
it is beautiful  that searchlight  the stars 
it is not a searchlight  it is a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince  not stars 
jason i am going back to highcliffe i came to say goodby
but you are happy here  you like your work 
do not make me tell you jason
i thought myself your friend mary just goodbye is not enough for a friend
it is because of jacqueline  i cannot go on looking for her 
you went to see mrs redi she told you something  what was it
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man
and you believe that
and gregory  he loves her
he loves you mary and you will have to tell him
he is jacqueline's husband i cannot
that is wrong mary
jacqueline mr romari phoned me she went out this afternoon with two men he would never seen before
they may have been friends of hers
oh the wine i have forgotten the wine
but you should make her laugh jason come make jokes for her i will bring your food to their table
yes dr louis judd
it is here too
no not at all mr jason
i would not want to take them out i just want to look at them
well since you are over twenty one
what a peculiar question
i saw you with her last week i knew you would be here tonight where is she
my dear fellow it is neither your business to ask nor mine to tell
but why come to me
i do not think that you would understand if i told you
after that wonderful first book  after all the adulation and the good reviews
actually i want to ask two favors of you  one as a poet 	one as a detective
it sounds strange and i am going to be very wary
it goes beyond that it praises the goodness of god and the greatness of all his works
i would forgotten
tell me where jacqueline is  we have got to find her
you do not expect me to do that do you
yes when i tell you
tell me what
i think it is time
no other reason  no woman not the little miss gibson
i wanted to get things clear for jacqueline let her know 
it might have
i would like that
yes miss gibson i have come to take you to your sister
cloven hoof
yes you know the devil and all his minions are marked that way
it will be fun meeting gregory every night at the station
i do not know
one believes  it is like any other religion
i would hardly describe it that way  the worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing
it seems right to us
but you would like to know where she is
yes there are certain punitive measures
i can imagine but you did say you came to me as my friend that you were concerned for me
a strange collection you are like the false god you worship fallen angels all of you
you are very flippant and perhaps wise but not wise enough to see the truth louis
no she is no longer under my care
i am very very serious
but you have never liked jason you always laughed at him  quarreled with him 
i am afraid not
yes  and i must say i have done very well with it  perhaps even better than jacqueline
i am stopping at the chatsworth
thank you my dear
that is too bad
i will be out in a minute
that will not be necessary i have not much to say
i cannot give up looking for her mrs redi no matter what you are hinting at
giacomo  la bellisslina madonna 
she is not been here for a long time
but she was here
yes  and pays the rent every month
no mrs lowood she does not write often
have you any other relatives mary
difficult has anything happened to jacqueline
we do not know mary we have been unable to get in touch with your sister
sometimes she can be quite careless why do not you try mrs redi
i do not know no gibson this is a restaurant many people come here
she is very beautiful
what did he say
shhh nancy the other children
no nancy	you have got to sleep two more minutes
i know this is difficult for you i know that you love her
what about judd  he knows about us
then it is decided leo and durk and i will make our plans
we have not even begun tea yet
i know you introduced jacqueline to us  but how could you tell 
i should have known she had no sincerity  no real belief
it will not hurt
make love to me 'nine i want you to make love to me please please make love to me
i cannot dummy he will see that the pack's been opened you are such a dumbhead
ok then i am gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself

oh but the nurse she went away i think she must go to look for you
just breathe normally
mr parkins what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady
did not seem worried about them
was this girl from starliner towers
that is the one
well let's wait for the xrays
well at least you still talk the same
so who changes
but you gave up your private practice suddenly you are into pure research and you you are what a parasitologist
did i say anything
i do not get it
it was women did it to hobbes could not handle them that girl that annabelle  talk about crazy projects
who was she
ok i will think about it
rollo how isa boy i was just thinking about you
no how come
it looks like  and i quote  'a disease to save man from his mind'
i do not get it
lemme clarify for you
i have got a date with one of them at ten can you make it
ok rog see you at ten
it can  ordinary matter like ours not affected  everything else disintegrates
i can trust rheya
you will end up like me
you are not gibarian
no  who am i then
a puppet
all right
did not you talk to snow
i want to hear your version
the same thing that could happen to any of us
where is his body
in the lab  with her probably
her  who are you talking about
she reappeared exactly as she had before
why did you agree to come here
not her  it
no she will not
why would you let her to do that
whose side are you on
how quickly
he is dead
where is sartorius
in his lab  he will not let you in
he will let me in
kelvin if you see anything unusual
why who did you see
gibarian warned me  he left me a message
who was it
she was real  where did she come from
oh that is a relief
how much sleep
how long can you go without sleep
that depends
well when you do go to sleep barricade your door
shut up
i told you try to stay calm  you are supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch
what was it
and professionally
will she come back
told you what
to who
what are you going to report back to earth
i do not know
what is it
can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour
i am just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances
when you cut yourself pounding the door did it hurt
if god is beyond our comprehension and she    is here for reasons that cannot be understood is not god here
not necessarily
who are you trying to convince
human beings can die
that is right  and we all have to sleep eventually
she drank liquid oxygen
she knows everything  does she know she came once before and you put her in 
i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan
what plan
just get him to stop
what do you want to do leave the station with her
maybe she does not need any  should we check
i will not be making the trip
maybe you can
i will go with you
i will just be a minute
i will be right back
to calm your anxiety
to calm my anxiety
my thomas is a little rusty
you did not look very happy
i was not
and tonight
stop it
you behave as though you want to fuck her
rheya  not here
you go home
i am  please come with me  i do not want to do this here
you talk like an actor
i know i know  but still somehow i do not feel better
all right  how about i feel better when you take them
what do you mean
do you remember beethoven  the beatles  movies books restaurants friends
intelligent beyond our comprehension
then it is god right
it is something
you still do not believe in god
as i said it is beyond our comprehension
as i said then it is god right
you were trying to break down the door  do you know why
when i saw you were gone i got scared
i been thinking about how much i hate you
you do not know
i do not know  i could not understand why you did not tell me
i think so
good  because i want you to know i really like fucking you
i know  i am putting that in my next report
he does have a point  that is just not the way i would like to see it proven
you feel sorry for solaris or for me
yes  yes
i am glad
you do not love me
that i am not rheya  that rheya died  killed herself  i am different
i am just trying to understand that is going on
yes  especially toward the end
why did she do it
you she said i did not love her
was she right
no  i love you
i love you too
i do not think do  it is not sleep it is something else  it is all around me
those are dreams
do not debate him he will say anything
i am just as human as you  i see i hear i touch and i feel just like you do
not this time
do you
if you are here
gibarian  he was here
you said he was dead
he is  but he was here
it is all right
i do not think it knows it is torturing us  it is just watching
i am disgusting
rheya i am not going back  i am staying here with you
then you will die
i want every second i can get with you
you should have told me
it would not have made any difference
thank you
chris i had to  i had to  i did not think you would react like this
neither did i
you never said you wanted one
i never said i did not
chris please  chris i am serious i will not make it
then you will not make it
i want you here
you are lying
you exist here  i keep telling you
that is impossible  i am not rheya
who are you then
i i am rheya  but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago
yes you are 
but then i would be dead now
i want to stop taking those pills
i wish you would not
they do something to me  it is hard to think straight
i think they help
i have consciousness but i am not mortal  do not you see why i am going crazy
you have to remember that i love you that is all that matters 
i cannot 
i do not know anymore  all i see is you
a sleeping pill  do you want yours
i do not know  something  anything
you must have been dreaming
shhhh  just stay with me  stay with me  everything is forgiven everything
why do you say that
he will not
we want to talk freely
are the actions of solaris premeditated
i am not snow
they never caught on
they may that is why i would keep my mouth shut
you must have shot off your mouth all the way from frankfurt to here
we did not
any news on dunbar
he is still in the kommandant's office that is all i know
just pulled the old match gag see
that is the match gag

and do not blame me if you all wind up in the cooler
the guy i want to talk to is sefton where is sefton  you have not seen sefton have you
i want everybody out of here we will need a lot of commotion on the compound
maybe it is crazy but it is better than having dunbar dead
just as you say hoffy but would not it be smarter if i went out and kept schulz tied up
we will take care of schulz  come on
i still say this is my tag any objections hoffy
any objections men
you would better cut out in back of the south latrine
why the south latrine
because that is where he is in the water tank
lay off schulz he is got a sickness he is krank
sometimes i think he is fooling us with that crazy business
one more thing gentlemen the kommandant told me to pick up the radio
what radio
come on everybody  let's go
just one question did you calculate the risk
go on sefton  butt out
a little weak today
are we boring you
says who
says me
you take it out only you are going to have a riot on your hands
every time the men get red cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them
with your mother's pull how come you are not a chicken colonel by now
lay off i said  if you do not want your head handed to you
i will say it is you spilled a little borscht on it
we did it
there better not be anything missing this is private property

you betcha there ought to be some reward money from mama say ten thousand bucks worth
let's synchronize the watches eleven fortytwo sharp
nothing for kuzawa
shapiro shapiro
just what makes you so popular
just one little thing how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson would not get out of the forest
i was not so sure i just liked the odds
they are lying dead in the mud out there and i am trying to find out how come
they know about that gadget i would worry more about the radio
what about the radio
i thought that is what you said you are from cleveland and you were with the thirtysixth bomb group
are you questioning me
just getting acquainted trying to make one friend in this barracks
do not bother sefton i do not like you i never did and i never will
what did you say
amazing what you can do with five thousand pingpong balls is not it
the germans know where dunbar is
maybe just one word kaput because you are kaput price
will you get this guy out of my hair so i can go
go where to the kommandant's office and tell him where dunbar is
i will kill you for that
what time
six o'clock i was having dinner
six o'clock in berlin they were having lunch in cleveland  am i boring you boys
the one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket
suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little  just out of decency
you are trying to say that an american would inform on other americans
give me the radio
we have no radio
all right gentlemen i will find it myself now let's see
ich weiss alles
wie hat er's gemacht
ganz einfach streichhoelzer und eine zigarette

the kommandant also sends you clean blankets he wants every man to have a new clean blanket
a chicken
just do not drool on it
what was i going to do with them i only smoke cigars

oh somebody was peeking
maybe those russian dames would take him
okay herr preismaier let's have the mail box
tell you what to do first get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the kraut guards then get yourself another face
incredible machine helmsman onequarter impulse power
and we are gaining stand by tractor beam
tractor beam aye
if he tries to get away with warp drive he is really in for a shock
he has been here for some time i can feel his presence
do not give me your klingon mumbo jumbo  there ai not another vessel in this whole damn quadrant
put me on the hailing frequency
sure  whatever games you wanna play
soon captain quite soon  
an energy reading from 'c deck  from inside mr spock's quarters
mr chekov i ordered spock's quarters sealed
yes sir i sealed the room myself nevertheless  i am reading a life form there
yes he has a long journey ahead
message acknowledged all units will be informed
sir commander starfleet on emergency channel he orders you to surrender this vessel
no reply chekov continue on course
mr scott we need everything you have got now
sir starfleet calling grissom again a warning about us
keep trying chekov at regular intervals
bones can you give me a quadrant biscan
what did you see chekov
for an instant a scout class vessel
could be grissom  patch in the hailing frequency  uss grissom this is enterprise calling come in please
short range scan mr chekov on screen mr sulu
dr marcus it is your planet
wait a minute we do not know what we are talking about here
on screen
it has to be gravitational fields were in flux it must have soft landed
in code to starfleet captaings spock's tube located intact on genesis surface will relay more data on subsequent orbits
what is it
thank you usiru
david sorry i am late
i went wrong
sector three subtropical vegetation temperature   temperature decreasing rapidly 
it is snow snow in the same sector fantastic
you must be very proud of what you and your mother have created
it is a little early to celebrate
underground deposit
negative on surface a manufactured object
there's only one thing it could be short range scan
a photon tube
short range scan
as before metallic mass verifying triminium photon tube no new data
check for trace radiation infrared enhancement
 radiation residual level is minimal
cross referenced and verified an unidentifiable life form reading
 or uwhou
i will handle that later
my readings indicate great instability
we are not here to investigate geological aging we are here to find life forms
spock's burial robe
grissom your message acknowledged will advise out
it would seem that grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack
you mean we are stranded down here
logic indicates that is the case
how can you be logical at a time like this we have to get thee hell off this planet
that may be difficult
why do not you just call for uhelpu
i have already made one transmission too many
not exactly
protomatter an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable
it was the only way to solve certain problems 
did your collaborator know
my mother knew nothing about it that is why i asked her to leave genesis in my hands
so like your father you changed the rules
if i had not it might have been years  or never
and spock with it they are joined together
days maybe hours protomatter has made the situation unpredictable  i am sorry
it will be hardest on spock soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood
i do not understand
pon farr vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life
i still do not
i will go
no i will do it  give me your phaser
you said there would not be any
 if the captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger i know the book saavik
affirmative captain our readings are well below danger level
very well exercise caution lieutenant this landing is captaings discretion and i am the one who's out on a limb
i will try to remember that captain
yes saavik go ahead
request permission to beam aboard immediately
saavik does dr marcus think there could be  any chance of  ah  radioactive contamination
none that i can detect sir
well all the same i am going to advise starfleet and get instructions
i know but  let's do it by the book stand by on this channel  go
we are under attack stand by for evasive  stand by for 
mr scott have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four
certainly sir how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker
your reputation is secure scotty  mr sulu take the con i will be in my quarters
i would be grateful admiral if you would give the word
gentlemen may the wind be at our backs stations please
scan for vessels in pursuit
aye sir
aye sir
aye those two hits should stop a horse let alone a bird
precautionary mr chekov shields up
oh god sir i dinna think so
that is wrong
they have knocked out the damn automation center  i have got no control over anything
just him sir
bones help spock everyone else find a station
saavik is david with you
yes he is and someone else vulcan scientist of your acquaintance
this vulcan  is he alive
he is not himself  but he lives he is subject to rapid aging  like this unstable planet
he gave his life to save us that is all i know
only one thing sir get him off this planet his aging is part of that is going on around us
goodbye david
what what are you saying
the katra ritual is meant to deposit spock's consciousness in the hall of ancient thought  not in his body
but we have spock alive that is more than we bargained for
 he will remain always as he is
much is at stake
yes and i know you
my father says you have been my friend you came back for me
you would have done the same for me
why would you do this
because the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many
the ship out of danger
you saved the ship spock you saved us all do not you remember
very well  mr chekov i need preapproach scan take the science station please
she is to be decommissioned
the word is no  i am therefore going anyway
count on our help sir
i will need it sulu
full impulse power
aye sir warp speed
mr scott as good as your word
can we hold speed mr scott
what about grissom mr chekov
yes sir it is getting larger as we close in
i think it is an energy form sir
yes enough energy to hide a ship would not you say
 a cloaking device
red alert mr scott
fire mr scott
about a dozen officers and men
with some on the planet
what about surface life signs
close there 
come on
go sulu
best speed to vulcan mr chekov take the prisoners below
saavik send to ambassador sarek tell him we are coming in
it is been a while sir here we go retrothrusters
no sir no response
hmm very odd  scotty progress report
approach control this is enterprise ready for docking maneuver
my friends the great experiment excelsior ready for trial runs
good evening commander everything ready
yes admiral step into my parlor
welcome home jim
indisposed sir
jim the enterprise is twenty years old we think her day is over
but we had requested  we were hoping to take her back to genesis
genesis whatever for
why  a natural desire to help finish the work we began
that is out of the question no one is going to genesis
may i ask why
no jim enterprise would never stand the pounding
then i will find a ship  i will hire a ship
out of the question the council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to genesis
then let me speak to the council harry upleaseu i can umakeu them understand
of course now take my suggestion enjoy your leave  and let all this tension blow away
you are right  thanks for the drink
any time
report status
who i am is not important that i have them is  i will let you speak to them
all right damn you all right  give me a minute to inform my crew
no tricks kirk you have one minute
no tricks i am looking forward to meeting you kirk out
you should take the vulcan too
because you wish it  
beam the vulcan up  and we talk
give me what i want  and i will consider it
you fool  look around you this planet is destroying itself
yes exhilarating is not it
if we do not help each other we will all die here
perfect that is the way it shall be ugive me genesisu
i will speak with you alone kirk
then you must know that you should have come with him to vulcan
but  why
then how 
kirk i must have your thoughts may i join your mind
of course
 the needs of the few
 or the one
sarek what if he melded with someone else
what must i do
you will find a way kirk if you honor them both you umustu
i am not sure only time will answer  kirk i thank you what you have done is 
what i have done i had to do
but at what cost your ship your son
if i had not tried the cost would have been my soul
great power to control dominate destroy if it works
understood my lord
say the wrong thing torg and i will kill you too
but sir federation starship approaching
good  this is the turn of luck i have been waiting for
they know we would die first
i trust my instincts  admiral kirk this is your opponent speaking
they outnumber us my lord 
yes my lord
steady continue on impulse power
wait wait
put him on screen  study him well
i underestimated him he did the one thing i did not anticipate  he destroyed himself
sir may i 
killing his son was ustupidu it made kirk willing to die
we still have the prisoners sir perhaps their information 
they are useless it was kirk i needed and i let him slip away
but surely our mission has not failed  
how is that
good for you lieutenant
but it is damn irregular no destination orders no encoded id
all true
well  what are we going to do about it
i am going to do nothing about it uyouu are going to sit in the closet
the uclosetu have you lost all sense of reality
this is not reality this is fantasy
yes please continue
you are me
no my name is data i am your brother
i am in a room with lights
no i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines
i do not understand
i know
no can i move now
no i must deactivate you
for how long
please beverly this is hard enough
if you start tearing up i promise to beam you out level one medical emergency  theres no crying in starfleet
about twentyfive years ago they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell
i think a skin cells the more likely of the two
you are working late
he was a bit proud as i recall
he was a damn fool selfish and ambitious very much in need of seasoning
he turned out all right
i wish i could believe that doctor
can you describe it deanna
i cannot be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating
how far we have come let me know if you need anything
soon then  ill save the last dance for you
to happy endings
will and deanna joining the titan dr crusher going to starfleet medical
and this makes you sad
to new worlds
new worlds yes data brave new worlds
thank you data  let's see what she can do
mister worf accompany data please
i can see that
good work the download
he believes he has our communications protocols but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels
aye sir this way
it would appear so
yes sir
we will find a way off together recommendations
there is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location
port thrusters sir would you like me to drive
affirmative sir negative sir they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals
well then only one way to go
we are about to find out power up disruptors and fire on my mark
ready captain
at our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes
of you
he may have already rejected my humanity but you also have a twin
i aspire sir to be better than i am the b9 does not nor does shinzon
it is interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography
yes sir the rift effects all longrange communications
commander riker evasive maneuvers
full axis rotation to port fire all ventral phasers
divert power and compensate
deanna stand by  open a channel
you are not looking at your self you are looking at me
you do not look like me
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation
i thought only me myself and lore
do not give up hope data i know i know you are not capable of hope
i am not
emergency force fields are holding
why is it moving
like me it has been designed with modular power sources
the resemblance is striking
thank you
the least i could do for you deanna  besides you know me im a talking head
and you need not worry i will brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know
with pleasure captain
of course sit down
i do not believe that sir weve shared many disappointing journeys
and i you
i do not know
captain do not assume he is anything like you are you should resist the urge to think you know him
i not only know him deanna i am him and he is me
i know how he thinks
make it so
this is not about me anymore
this is not real
can you feel my hands are they real can you feel my lips my loins
you sick bastard
your timing is impeccable commander
the empire considers this a matter of internal security we regret you have become involved
when this is over i owe you a drink
do you have life support
this is commander donatra of the valdore we are dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies
thank you commander
what do we know about the planet
uncharted we will have to get closer for a more detailed scan
what do we know about the population
then how did a reman get to be praetor i do not get it
which is why our initial scans did not pick it up but he is got it captain
as i remember thalaron research was banned in the federation because of its bioqenic properties
he wants to look me in the eye
deanna on my mark
ready sir
the targeting sequence should take about four minutes
aye sir
on screen
i will take care of it sir
number one  you have the bridge
there's more as always he is reman
let's hope that luck holds janeway out
praetor shinzon i am pleased to
i am not shinzon i am his viceroy we are sending transport coordinates
what are you doing to counsellor troi
listen to him android such a small and weak creature yet he roars so valiantly
there will be another after me and another after that you will find we are a resilient species
i look forward to the sport  take him
wont do what mister worf
captain i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear  naked
come now a big strapping fellow like you what are you afraid of
what sort of signature
if you do not mind
not yet mister worf
fiftytwo disruptor banks twentyseven photon torpedo bays primary and secondary phased shields
on screen
who was it
on screen
aye sir
on my way please notify commander riker
your new chair sir
still well on our side
i appreciate your concern number one but i have been itching to try out the argo
acknowledged   i will talk to data
a coup d'etat
the praetor's power has always been the romulan fleet they must be behind him
it is an old psychological strategy number one to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy
it is working
patience diplomacy is a very exacting occupation we can wait
she is a predator
away team transporter room four
can anything be done for him
and the romulans invade
we can only hope so
unless we can disable his cloak we are just going to be firing in the dark
she is the most beautiful ship ive ever seen
i promise you in time she will become your home if i could offer you one piece of advice
i intend to
the honor was mine captain riker
praetor shinzon
yes i am sorry captain  there's so much we have to talk about
i would be interested to know what we are talking about
i have dissolved the senate
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow just the two of us or just the one of us
you know i need to verify this
i know
you will acquire a taste for it
not quite i envy the hair line
our eyes reflect our lives do not they yours are so confident
how did you end up on remus
no race should be a slave to another
i have no reason to
were we always explorers
new worlds
age before rank jean luc
i always hoped i would hit two meters
with a full head of hair
there is that
i know
in time
why am i here
i was lonely
i need a sample of your blood what do your borg friends say resistance is futile 
it is about destiny picard about a reman outcast who
you are not reman
my life is meaningless as long as you are alive what am i while you exist a shadow an enigma
i am incapable of such an act and so are you
we are
i know you will all gladly die to save your home world
not so long
childish dreams captain lost in the dilithium mines of remus i am what you see now
i see more than what you are
but you want to
you can still make a choice make the right one now
i have no choices i cannot fight what i am
i am
on my way
disruptors are offline sir
what about picard
our greater goal is more important brother
but praetor you will not survive without him
it is invigorating
he is a very unusual android
runs in the family
should i raise shields
defensive pattern kirk epsilon geordi get those shields online
we are being hailed
let's go
yes praetor
he is gentler than i thought and he has a sense of humor
do not forget our mission shinzon we should act now time is running out
my time i will spend it how i choose
find her again
no  this is wasting time
do as i tell you
have the doctors prepare i will be on the bridge'
a matter of hours now
seven minutes
she is here
they are holding position
it is imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath
the scimitar will serve my needs
but surely
i came this far alone 
you do not have to understand
and bringing the enterprise here what possible purpose could that serve
i have a purpose
then perhaps you will enlight en us
silence romulan
for the moment
and when i return you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect
okay cash  logical  here's everything i have on me what do you say  how about a rolex
i already got a real one  come on it will not be too bad  it is not personal
just not the eyes
hey fuck you man
a star is born
joey make sure mr nero gets safely to his car
leave him alone tran
paranoia's only reality on a finer scale
you are going down
i would love to  but he keeps showing up  and you keep talking to him  i cannot have that
fuck you
maybe later
believe it  now bring me the trodes baby  come on quick
what are you going to do
i am not  just a little poach job
'we might as well make the best of it'
watch and see
i just want to see what we are like together through your eyes

okay  it was funny  but it cost me money
d'you always have to dress like a fucking pimp
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe
that is not saying much
it is the one thing that stands between me and the jungle
hey iris you okay
uh unh carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket
shutup a second
i was gonna tell ya  hey it is just a job  i feel like shit about it
you should feel like shit
yeah  no not really
let's work it

come on lenny  you used to be good at this stuff  play it down that is the perp doing
he stalks her  he rapes her  then he does her

well the guy's fucked up
who was just here
iris man  pay attention
wait wait wait a minute  iris was here
yeah she came by last night shaking like a junkie wanting me to make a copy of some clip
what clip  what was it
you are not a client anymore tran i would not sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls
i already got everything i need from you
faith can i talk to you a second
that would be between me and faith would not it
i was invited here by a close friend mr fumitsu see he is right over there

excuse me  what part of no do not you understand
mace you are my friend  i need you plus i will give you 25% of what i make tonight
lenny this may be a hard concept for you but friends do not have to pay their friends
driving mr lenny
no wrong i sell experiences sex is only part of it
buncha technoperv jerkoffs
way i look at it i actually perform a humanitarian service  i save lives
uh huh i wanna hear this part
define illegal
me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months
yeah but that was for love
define love
coming with you
you will not live to see the morning
let's talk in the car
i have had enough of this shit  you are on foot lenny
in la  are you crazy
get it
no you are just trying to get off
macey i have never seen you like this
look i gotta get some sleep
you still like me do not you  we are still buddies
macey i know you are tired but can you drop me at the retinal fetish it is on your way
jesus lenny
guy named wade beemer  used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97
rams that is football right
she still loves me
she thinks you are a bucket of dog vomit  trust me on this
she is my destiny
what i am saying  but you still come out this goofball romantic
it is my sword and my shield macey
no idea
go to the sunset sheraton  right now  just go  go
black  jack
blackjack  i do not understand
wants to share
this guy is someone you know one of your squidhead contacts
so some psycho wirefreak gets to keep running around
you ever wonder why you get beat up a lot
never really thought about it
so that gives you something
it gives me i do not know maybe two hundred people who i know wear
i need to see more get more detail  something  i feel his presence so strong
yeah  i am ghosting pretty bad
no it does not
because iris knew somebody was after her
if he could do that is on that tape he is a sicko
that is where it gets a little strange
and what about the guy that was following me
now you are really getting paranoid
ok  he asks about you all the time it is been weeks since you have seen him
jesus mace
anywhere  we will talk about it in the car
this tie does not go with blue
mace the guy had a knife  to my throat  in my living room relaxing might be right out okay
you better keep a low profile for a while
no shit  you got someplace in mind
she wanted to go out to my car something about my car
something in your car
it is in my case  okay  i am going to open my case
bullet resistant  whatever happened to bullet proof
lenny  calm down  this is what i do
it is okay lenny  they would never get here in time anyway
the gas tank's going to go any second
fire's out is not it
you sure
it is the walk  something  anyway they will run your plates and get your address  we gotta keep moving
i cannot tell you  you have got to see
uh unh  i will not do it
i see  i see the earth opening up and swallowing us all
yeah i know  so what do we do
you know what this tape could do if it gets out
i have got a good idea yeah
people finding out seeing that the lapd just flat out executed jeriko one  jesus  maybe they ought to see
maybe  but tonight is probably not the best night  come on we are rolling
there's a plus side
yeah  you gave up your hot tub tape to save me  that is real progress for you
it was a tough call
i still cannot square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops
i do not think those cops did iris i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her
how long does it last  oh
yeah right blow it open
why did not he just go public with the tape  save himself that way
i am not going
whatya mean  we are going  trangs gonna do her right there unless
it did not stop you from loving them right  or understanding them or being able to forgive them
i guess
and it did not stop you from wanting to protect them  did it
no  it did not
good lenny  i can see why the detective gig did not work out  come on
no  they must have sent it to my beach house by mistake
uh unh
and do what  take on his whole posse
i still got one ace to play  trangs got what i want and i have got what he wants
exactly  that is why it is a make able deal
a cop  you want me to trust a cop
no  trust me
then we will be right where we are now
yeah right  fucked
naw  they just have to ask us a few questions for about six hours
yeah  we did
see you downtown
yeah  see you there
just lenny
right  that explains it
are you going to make me beg
cheerios and wieners  i made it myself  it is good
well give me some then i am starving
aw mom
sucks  hey bobby turn that up
yup  he was jeriko's manager  bummer tran  lost your golden goose  could not happen to a nicer guy
but i mean is not he faith's new 
sssssh  not in front of lenny  you may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him
take the tape to the cops
this seems a little sophisticated for them  these are not subtle guys
there's more to this whole thing than you think
you really want that on your head
good  he never doubted you
the don himself is coming to me tonight
yes i understand i am listening
you owe the don a service  he has no doubt that you will repay it
and what is that bonasera
i ask for justice

just hold us together till we are in space that is all
we could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship  that would kill it
no we cannot afford to lose that much oxygen  we are going to have to flush it out
i hope not
all right  roby and melkonis will go with faust  hunter and i will make up the second team
well we better do something
poison gas
meet us on the bridge  be careful  it is uhugeu now
no i do not want us separated
you just sealed it off it cannot get to that section
uhe isu the only one that knows that
how does he breathe
yeah but how  his nose and mouth are blocked
it is eating a hole in the floor
but this thing uses it for ubloodu
hell of a defense mechanism  you do not dare kill it
is not there some way we can get it off him
you cannot tell  that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits
we would be sitting ducks in the freezers
boy that is terrific
well how does it feel to be rich men
it would not come
ask him
careful do not get under it
i will come with you
maybe it was not always dead
the door was closed  it must still be in here
well what the hell good can we do in here  we cannot grab it  it might jump on us 
maybe we can catch it
he is running a fever
still unconscious
the machine will bring his temperature down  his vital functions are strong
how do we locate the creature
the only other thing i can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out
sounds like a rough one
got a better idea
at least it cannot get up here now
oh my god
does anybody know what happened
i do not buy that  there's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers
good  that is good
we can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely once the lifeboat is in space
the flamethrower needs more fuel
right  we have got a lot to accomplish  let's get moving
should we go outside and bring him in
no the risk is too great  perhaps after we have destroyed the thing
what we really need is some red meat in here for bait
let me go first you stay behind me
i cannot the acid will pour out
i have completely lost their signal
can you get them back
i am trying
the computer just translated the goddamn message  it is not an sos it was a warning
we are not going anywhere
but they do not know about the translation  they could be in danger right now
just can that crap  i am in command here till chaz returns  and nobody's leaving this ship
how many
three blips  they are coming this way
jay this is cleave  meet me at the main air lock
i guess i had it coming  let's call it settled
what is it  i cannot tell anything 
it is some kind of organ  it is inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat
oh god
it does not make any sense  it paralyzes him puts him into a coma then keeps him alive
i think it is fizzled out
hey  what about the film
listen had not somebody better check on broussard
it was horrible  horrible  like a chicken
we sure need this flamethrower
and right next to it that oval design with the markings  it is a dead ringer for the spore casings
you will notice though that there are no more phases  only four forms are shown  after that the pattern repeats
and the creature with it  we can make it back to irth in the lifeboat
we can use the flamethrower
it is not going to work
hey look somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat
is it armed
if you press the button right now it will blow the whole nose of the ship off
thanks for the thought 
feast your eyes
sandy can you home in on that beam
that is the frequency
computer that is the frequency of the transmission
dell  show me that on a screen
well this rock rotates every two hours  the sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes
sorry  nothing but that same damn transmission every 32 seconds  i have tried every frequency on the spectrum
you lead
my signal's fading
how far
we should be almost on top of it  i just cannot quite
who knows
that creature sure must have considered it important using his last strength to draw it
cannot tell  these weather conditions could erode anything fast
i could not make it out  too much interference
sun will be down in a minute
maybe we should just wait a few more minutes
is it still coming up or is it hooked on something
no it is coming
can you see anything
udo not touch him watch itu
help me  i am going to try to get it off
what is it
how the hell should i know  come on give me a hand let's get him out of there
let's let the machine work on him
yes thank heaven
we are just plain lucky  that could have gone right through the hull  taken uweeksu to patch it
reminded me of when i was a kid and the roof leaked  everybody running for the pots and pans
is it still dripping
it appears to have healed itself
they are from a dead civilization they are spores from a tomb  god knows how long they have been here
we are going into the freezers now
the commander normally has first publication rights
maybe we could write it together
we will have to trap it somehow  if we had a really strong piece of net we could bag it
time and space have no meaning out here  we are living in einsteinian equation
come on  let's go above and see how they are coming with the gear
are they close
they are on the next level up
let's get moving with this net
just a second  those are not water vapor clouds they have no moisture content
that tube must be depositing it in him
could be some kind of venom or poison
that is the matter you do not like this stuff
tastes like something you would feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs
right  fire up all systems
sandy contact traffic control
let's hear it
computer you have signalled a priority three message  what is the message
well it is finally happened
no  that is atmosphere  cloud layer
turn on navigation lights
engine room what happened
sandy how far are we from the source of the transmission
nontoxic but unbreathable pressure
ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter
good  moisture content
zero  dry as a bone
any microorganisms
not a one  it is dead
anything else
yeah rock particles  dust
good  i am getting you clear too let's just keep the line open
found what
it appears to be some sort of spacecraft  we are going to approach it
i do not even know what i am looking for
still worried
oh well you know me
i have always respected your opinion martin  if something worries you it worries me
tell you what martin  as soon as the engine's fixed 
yeah we hear you  we are coming back
thank christ  we lost you  listen there's been a new development 
cannot talk now broussard's injured we will need some help getting him into the ship
we are coming up now open the outer lock door
chaz  what happened to broussard
it is some kind of organism it is attached itself to him  let us in
chaz if it is an organism and we let it in the ship will be infected
we cannot leave him out here open the door
broussard had film in his datastick did not he  we can see what happened to him
is that its mouth
if we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship 
up one kilometer jay
you bet we made it  martin set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive
with great pleasure
quit complaining we are in space
that is okay he can remain in hypersleep until they are ready to treat him
all right so that is what we have got a week  it is plenty of time
but if we uhave notu caught it in a week then we have to go into the freezers anyway
where are you
foodstorage room
we are coming
it started crashing around right after we locked it in
now what
i guess we open the door and net it
go ahead jay
what do you think  now we go in
the man would need protection obviously  as well as some way to drive the thing before him
let's be democratic
right now let's keep it closed
by eating our food supplies
that is that supposed to mean
well yes there's a pattern but it is meaningless to me
i know it looks like a senseless jumble but if you look closely there are recognizable forms
so the next step should be 
 more spores coming
can we get to him
okay  first we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines
that will blow the ship up
but the idea's good if we could just turn it around somehow
it is stable it does not hurt to drop it
who gets the privilege
and you will let me know when you have got it coming this way
and you stand aside while we drive it in then shut the hatch launch the boat and 
what did it do to you
i will get you out of there
no do not
but i can save you  get you to the autodoc
no good it is eaten too much of me
what can i do
kill me
i sure could not hurt it could i
it was fine the way it was
it was bullshit the way it was
i have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from virginia
what have you been here nine monthsi been in this business since i was sixteen
bradlee went to harvard
they are all the same all those ivy league placesthey teach you about striped ties and suddenly you are smart
i am smart enough to know my story was solid
mine's better
no way
read 'em both and you will see
mainly it has to do with your choice of words
forget it the main thing  did you call me a failure
i was sure trying
let me lay a little theory on you
i am not interested in theory what do we know for example hunt's disappeared
well barker tried to get blueprints of the miami convention center and the airconditioning system
hunt does not seem like your ordinary consultant
maybe a political operative of some sort
a spy you mean
it makes sense hunt worked for the cia and the white house was paranoid about teddy kennedy
about the past year
i met a presidential aide once at a social occasion
and you have not called him
the fucking new york times
fifteen phone calls
fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in miami to gordon liddy at creep
why did not we get that
christ and i even know somebody at the phone company
you dowith access to records
were you eyebrow reading
alphabetically on the creep phone list miss helen abbott of south george street
you are not a kid anymore
i never scared anyone before
it is not us they were scared before we got there  what do we know
facts or theory
anything you have got
we know there's got to be something or they would not be so panicked
it is safe try it you will see
you believe in the president you would not ever want to do anything disloyal
we appreciate your positionreally
and i am a republican
you voted for him
go on go on
it goes very highwe have got to find out where
we will
she was really paranoid the bookkeeper
that happens to people  ok go on
you mean who's going to play the mean mp and who's going to be the nice one  whichever
he is another ivy leaguer so he will probably expect you to be understandingmight surprise him if you are not
you want me to be the bastard
and i will just shitkick in my usual way
the lookout in the motor inn  he say anything we do not know
just that a lot of reports were sent to creep but he does not name who not here anyway
i know i know
if we could name the guys got the reports we would be ahead again
shit who do we know
i know a lawyer at justice
has he got an ax
almost every source we have used has been republican this guy's a card carrying democrat
then he is got an ax  call him anyway
i have not said anything
'cause i only know four chords
you asking would i have been one of the president's men  i would have been
could have won him a fraternity paddle with a white house seal  god knows it worked
we are inside the white house now
mitchell stans magruder kalmbach
we are working on the last guy now and we are going all the waythat fifth man was haldeman
what if i went up and introduced myselfthink he would slug me
well we are trying to ruin his life
it is nothing personal though 
that is the matter
same as magruder i do not like it when they turn out to be human
i wish we were investigating attila the hun
maybe we are
and the fbi confirmswhat more do you need
deep throat will not confirmi never thought he was scared of anyone but he is scared of haldeman
i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury 
we got twenty minutes to deadline
john n mitchell while serving as us attorney general personally controlled a secret cash fund that
what time is it
i am on deadline
the telephone calls we know about that
the rest is barker's bank records it is mostly the eightynine thousand in mexican cashier's checks
yeah that was in the times this morning
this  naw
howard hunt
sure him i liked he was a very nice person secretive too traveled all over but a decent man
any idea what he did
oh the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating kennedy
teddy kennedy
i am so glad
i would really like to see mr dardis
and you will  but not now
i called him from washington he is the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning
i told you he had to go out on a case
he is not in the car  sorry
well of course
good just tell him i was here that i am sorry i missed him
that is right
mind if i try
i have got a lot of energy
listenwe know you are involved in thiswe are going to get the story why not help
they never told me anything except my own rolei had to find out the rest in the papers
by they you mean
when did he hire you
i did not do anything wrong
tell that to muskie
oh maybe nickel and dime stuff
you wrote the canuck letterthe one where you claimed muskie slurred the canadians
i did not
but you know who did
chapin did contact you then
sureoff the record
on the orders of haldeman
that was awhile ago
deep throat
if they ever start calling us goddamn liars  it is time to start circling the wagons
there's nothing new in it
oh they are here  i am keeping much better records now hannah  see 
you are two months behindyou got enough to cover
i think
give me your checkbook then
it is right under that pile
there's always a later plane
you are a sex junkie you know that carl
anyplace really public they would know about itthey know everything at the committee carl
you do not really think you are being followed
i do not know what they would do to me
hey easy
we are a long way from high school carl  and i am scared
just let me get a match
right right i have got to go  why did you lie just then
it is obvious you want to talk to someonewell i am someone
it was all in hundreds was not it
i cannot be positive that it was used for the breakin but people sure are worried
which people
the ones who could disburse the money
who were they
there were a group of themi think five i do not know their names
sloan knew which five did not he 
'cause i am not calling out from the phone company anymore  i think the place is bugged
so tell me about the times article
what do you want to know
no games irwin give
and that makes anything you do ok is that it
just tell me about the goddamn article
it was accurate but i cannot get a fuller listing for youall barker's phone records have been subpoenaed
who by
a miami da the guy doing the investigating is named martin dardis 
irwin i really feel bad doing something like thisyou know that do not you
they are worse that is why i quit
that is another of the things i am not so sure of
because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors
we were never told flat out do not talk but the message was clear
to cover up
well they sure did not ask us to come forward and tell the truth
i will not talk about the other two
kalmbachnixongs personal lawyer
this will only take one second
it is gotta be haldemansomeone from the white house had to be involved
i am not your source on that
let me put it this way i would have no problem if you did
and we will all have to go to work for a living
christ i wish i knew if we should print this
my nondenial denial
how senior
you asking me to disclose my source
i do not know titles
is he on the level of assistant to the president or not
he approved the payments to liddy while he was still attorney general
his dialing finger must be falling off
what do you think
he went to her apartment and he told her
i am not sure it still feels thin 
electronic surveillance
look i told you inside
you have nothing more to say i understand that
i assure you there's nothing mysterious involved
there is no reason to assume other people were involved
your clients were arrested with a walkietalkie they did not need that to talk among themselves
you are a lawyer and you are here
i met one of the defendants mr barker at a social occasion once  i have nothing more to say
a miami social occasion  mr rafferty told me the cubans were from miami
are you implying you do not believe me
i have nothing more to say
you do not mind getting on people's nerves do you
absolutelymarilyngs gotten it totally wrong
she is an awfully good reporteri cannot remember her getting too much wrong before can you
that is a bullshit question that is a question straight out of wichita kansas
sorry ken listen one last thing where did your talk with berger happen
where  what do you mean where
well was it in a bar her apartment some restaurant
i have completely forgotten where it was except i know it was not her apartment
yes sir
i see and how do you think it reached miami
nothing that is the problemthe story's gone underground
because the press stinks toohistory on the run that is all you are interested in  you come up with anything
to where
go on
i did everything you said but it all seemed
what i know you will have to find out on your own
liddyyou think there's a chance he will talk
whobe specific how high up
you will have to find that out will not you
the slush fund at creep financed the ratfucking we have almost got that nailed down so
do justice and the fbi know what we know and why the hell have not they done anything about it
they know but they focused on the burglaryif it did not deal with the breakin they did not pursue it
why did not theywho told them not to
someone with authority i would imagine would not you  do not you know what you are onto come on
mitchell knew then
you get nothing from me about haldeman
do not concentrate on segretti or you will miss the overall scheme too
there were more then
follow every leadevery lead goes somewhere
the canuck letterwas that a white house operation
do not you miss the grand scheme too
how grand
i was being cautious  you can safely say more then fifty
you will have to find that out will not you
hi i am bob woodward of the post and
yes yes what is it
james mccord
will you step forward sir 
security consultant
where in government
central intelligence agency
i am woodward
are you sure
it may never come out
never please do not tell me never  ben says you have found some wonderful sources
some justice department lawyers and an fbi man and some people from the committee to reelect yes ma'am
and the underground garage one  would i know him
i could not say
but it is possible
it is
i really want to know
nobody ever had too much
nobody gives a shit about the dahlberg repercussions
quit equivocating say what you mean  our story got government accounting to start an audit on creep's finances
absolutelyand that is all they do sit sit sitevery once in a while they call up a senator some reporting
well what if your boys get it wrong
two o'clock work the phones until you go
that is everything bachinski had i think it is worth following up
i did all right on mccord
lotsa hints
i cannot sell hints to simons  you called everyone you know  call someone you do not know
the most powerful man in america is president nixon probably you have heard his name
well sloan
in other words you got nothing you are thumbsucking
could develop
let me see what you get but do not jumpthe new york times thinks it is crazy cubans
that was awhile ago
i do not get ityou were the one who wanted to fire him
political personal sexual anything at all against mitchell
go over your sources again
maybe i am tense
one senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes
i do not know but i do not think that is unreasonable either do you
larry young a california lawyer
well and good but when will he say it on the record
he just did
my wife told me to expect you  as you know i have not talked to the press
no it was closer to seven hundred thousand
and as treasurer you could release those funds
when so ordered
we are not sure we have got all the guys who could order you but we know there were five 
haldeman  right
i will not talk about the other two
one thing i am not completely clear onwhen you gave out the money to liddy how did that work
a girl melissa
no none of those
of courseeverything they asked
i already get the post i do not need another subscription
no i am a reporter i wanted to talk to you about the committee to re elect
the what to what
you work there miss abbott

needs patching
now why do not you get around to saying what you want

107  continued
inside of three hours you would be dragging my dead carcass
used to see the natives eating roots when i was a kid in nome
134  continued  
139  continued
175  continued
43   continued
i will get you there all right
94   continued  
it will be interesting trying to build a fire without any wood
i just want this over with
157  continued
there is not one unless corbett's men get here before the plane does
i would sure like that favor you offered a while back
your infrared camera
keep back
i was making my rounds saw your hangar wide open plane getting rained on so i closed it up
question is why they sat here when the storm moved in  check their stuff while i sniff around
28   continued
back against the bars  now
six months
cannot be  too keen a sense of this place in your pictures
i do not want to talk any more
i have not but i very much want to  what do you know about the trouble in devil's cauldron
i was hoping you had some news 
the radio's on the fritz
where would you say eric is
somewhere along the pipeline
what about that hotheaded marshal sam wilder  i heard he was in the middle of this mess
sam  we have not seen him
really  i thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside  by the way  your truck also 'on the fritz'
be right back  i left my camcorder in the car
he still might be around  i saw fresh tire tracks coming in
be careful  there are two of them
bastards took off though did not they
best thing is meyerling has to chase around to find us
the little creep hates it that eric actually does what the company hired him to do
eric leave it alone  it is not your business
no way can he get away with this i will be back by tonight
sure did  he was one of the trappers we rousted from the haul road
was there any trouble
he was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker
going after killers is not the same as chasing poachers eric
you were looking at it in the catalog  do not know where you can wear it
that is not what i meant
it is exactly what you meant
prolonged darkness makes people crazy
not me  i am equipped
come here
wait a second
fairbanks is a threehour flight i will be back by dinnertime
that is my line
you cannot stay here  go back to the turtle  i will meet you back there in a few hours
that is going on
i will tell you everything later
where is corbett
here  a transport plane is due at eleven  once i put him on it it is all over
so that is the problem
i am staying
nothing broken  c'mon we have to hurry
i have got an idea  we will have to work fast
my home is here  with you
let's keep going  we are only an hour from devil's cauldron
relax  i just want to ask them how the hunting is
i know  least you did not shoot all of them
okay by me  you are the one likes these hot springs so much
leave my traps  we will tag up couple days
cannot be much of a crime if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid
i got your plate number asshole maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail
yep  afraid you have me at a disadvantage
kenai at the general store asked me to bring these  did not expect we would already met
no big deal  we just got off on the wrong foot  that is your name
six months  ecological study for northland oil
ecology  folks use that term for everything but what it means who's eating who
yeah  maybe so
 to take you to jail  it will be my pleasure
a daughter in oregon
send him down to her  there's money in my duffel bag back at his cabin
smart  sure  that is why i am sitting in this plane and they are down there blowing me kisses
i needed a pilot's license to take the job here so i got one in six weeks
that makes the flight more interesting
you got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger
i took the odds on getting down in one piece and i made it  now we are in my territory
with light clothing and no supplies this is nobody's territory
that is right  you are not
look take these cuffs off  we need to work together
i do not plan on dying
snow shelter  okay  you dig i will have a little sitdown
i have been on ice like this when i was a kid skating  spread your weight keep moving  go on
i am right behind you
let's camp  there's grayling under this ice i will snare some for dinner
we have got another two hours of daylight
pushing it is flat wrong  all you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail
forget it  it would take days
going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on
i am still figuring you are either real brave or real dumb
you know meyerling
sure  the people's friend  kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it
i am here to do my job
too bad we are heading west
you are not going to slow us down keep moving
if that means freeze my balls off no thanks  i will be okay
how many do you see
what  fuck off  save yourself
you do not feel cold
it is a spring day
where is my elt
emergency transmitter  all your gear is back at wilder's
you got one
it was blown up with the plane
too bad  we would be out of here in a few hours
an appetite  maybe you will not die after all
hate to disappoint you
you got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them
yeah it is fucked up  but it is not too late to keep that from happening here
cowardly bastard  i am in handcuffs and i still scare the piss out of you
do not bet on it
i already have
you do not know how true that is
you broke the radio remember
i am sure she is fine  seemed like a clever kid
shut up
you kill me you sign your death warrant  and hers
wound's a throughandthrough missed my liver i think
let's get out of here
like i said i would still be up on that mountain frozen solid it was not for you
we will get you to a hospital soon as we get to fairbanks
benboys  yeah real slow and i would like to keep it that way
just passing through
i am living proof of that sad fact
can we buy the marshal some dinner
no i better stay at my post
but i would
sam give dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit will you
do not try me  i will kill you if it comes to it
i do not want to hurt you sam
i am not too old to knock the snot out of you
nothing personal
that is the problem with sam wilder's place
will you rent me a cabin or not
 forget it  and try not to bleed on my throw rugs  why do this
if you have to ask you would not understand
have you heard anything from the girl staying with me anne marie
not a damn thing  that is going on  mr meyerling was here all steamed up looking for you
look neff i have got ben corbett with me 
 here  where is wilder
back at my place he uh broke his leg
 i am putting him on the plane to fairbanks eleven tomorrow
jiminy christmas  what do you want from me
just stay out of my face until i am gone
yeah  sorry i barked at you last night
what are you talking about
bastards killed sam you think they will not kill the rest of us
there will be three four men at the most  i have some backup nothing will happen
you are an outsider mr desmond step aside stay out of it
what does this matter to you
this is not your concern  it is over here and now
 we appreciate the company anne marie's getting cabin fever already
mobile arctic dwelling  mad
damn  likely that is an sos have to pass on that lunch

puppets maxine it is the idea of being inside someone else feeling what they feel seeing what they see
it better be
he is an actor one of the great american actors of the 20th century
that is he been in
yes of course he is a celebrity
good we will sell tickets
tickets to malkovich
exactly two hundred dollars a pop
but there's something profound here maxine we cannot exploit it
sure it would be fun
really  but maxine can of worms end of the world illusory nature of existence
i will protect you dollface
so unbolt the fucking door einstein
are you torturing me on purpose
i have fallen in love
you are evil maxine
a girl has a right to glow if she wants it is in the fucking constitution
yes yes sweetheart yes
of course right this way mr malkovich compliments of the house
how the hell would i know i was not a philosophy major
jm inc be all that someone
hello wendy
don i was wondering do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings
hush sweetheart
no do not be an ass
can i be anyone i want
you can be john malkovich
yes yes a thousand times yes
and as i said sir we cannot very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel malkovich
right lester i heard you the first time i am not a dummy
did not mean to imply that you were sir
we saw his show at the luxor last night
vegas what would you think
the kid's got talent you have never seen malkovich like this schwartz had him up there singing and dancing impressions
impressions those are hard
very talented son of a bitch too bad we cannot kill him
no a sexy dream of course a scary dream
i like that
maxine says she will leave him if he leaves malkovich plus he is been challenged to a puppetduel by mantini
the great mantini
no the mediocre mantini of course the great mantini
oh he is good great actually i saw him do tru with his sixty foot robert morse puppet sensational
but i think i have another plan
do tell i love a good plan
why are you being like this
i am the devil lester i think i can handle it
i was just asking no disrespect intended
fine let's drop it
fine your mail's on the kitchen table mostly junk oh there's a letter from alex trebek
gehginnis ondah foam

fork ah did
fine woman floris i do not know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine
someone names a lot of warts on line two

it is my job to ask the questions yours to answer them
says who
says me do you dream often
do you
i am sure you are not going crazy
kevin i am telling you it was like nothing i have
yeah yeah yeah yadda yadda yadda were you stoned
yes but you see someone else was talking through my mouth
you were stoned case closed end of story how hot is this babe
i think it might have been this lotte woman talking through me maxine likes to call me lotte
you are crazy to let go of a chick who calls you lotte i tell you that as a friend
i do not know anything about her what if she is some sort of witch or something
all the better hey hot lesbian witches next geraldo buddy boy ha ha ha
i gotta know the truth kevin
the truth is for suckers johnnyboy
lots of carrot juice little lady that and a deal with the devil
do we get to wear a crown
but of course
count me in
good i think its time to beckon mr flemmer perhaps he can help us out of this pickle
yes of course dr lester
oh be still my heart
dr lester would you point me toward the restroom
no you must not my child
but why son of malkovich
you followed your heart my child and that is not necessarily a bad thing
but now we have lost access to craig
my child i do not think its a great mystery what craig's up to
craig stole maxine from me dr lester
hmmm a lesbian are you i must inform you that i find that highly arousing
no you do not understand i have been inside malkovich when i am with maxine
oh did not anyone show you the indoctrination video
you bastard
it is craig in there i can tell
why not i need to get in there
i am not certain my dear but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route
that bastard i will gladly dispose of him in the name of the order son of malkovich
i am afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel
yes hi
let her go craig i mean him
i have never been looked at like this by a woman
i love you lotte
i have to see you
sweetie oh but we cannot it is business hours i need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers
one hour
i thought so too doll i guess we were mistaken
did you see the reviews
yeah i saw them
we will see schwartz we will see
say equus it is got everything
never heard of it
broadway's finest three hours it is about the suppression of the individual conformity as god in modern society
sounds boring are there any songs
nothing but acting to hide behind buddyboy
is there dancing
who's calling
you do not know me but i am a great admirer of yours
how would you get this number
whatever you are having
oh i am really glad you called
oh sure it is very rewarding
do you mind
no i guess not i am an actor
yes maxine yes
oh lotte
oh dollface it was just your passion for me taking hold
no dollface i know what my passion taking hold feels like i gotta go
i can explain about the portal darling
lotte called me
oh so the bitch escaped
apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now
i am getting better all the time
you mean with malkovich
i would love to see your work
really yeah okay
you see maxine it is not just playing with dolls
you are right my darling it is so much more it is playing with people
no  but how will we make a living my love if our clientele does not have access to our product
well we will have all the money in malkovich's bank account plus he still gets acting work occasionally
it is okay my sweet
he is a selfish bastard
sleepy suddenly
i have got to leave malkovich
you have got to be kidding
i just had the most horrifying nightmare the devil was in it
perhaps you will want to consult that ouija board again

no no  i did that
sorry nothing  see you  i am going to be late

layton oh shit
what is it
how much do you know
not much

he is a freelance subversive
you did not know as much about this business as you pretended to did you
er  no
very smart
er  but i would have found out anyway
yes i am impressed
tell me about layton
look after that suit eh barbara chose it for me

barbara's a perfectly good name is not it
look about the layton woman  maybe she is just trying to help the buttle family
baffled i do not follow you
out of kindness
kindness that is the purpose behind this line of enquiry
so what are you going to do about her
get her out of circulation  i have put her on the detention list
you mean you are going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department
well i  good point what do you suggest
let me try to get to her i will deactivate her
what does that mean i do not want to be involved in anything unsavoury
trust me you do trust me do not you
of course we went to school together you are my oldest friend
and you are mine
you are the only person i can trust
then we would better keep this business just between the two of us
right just between as and the security forces
they were not at school with us
but i have already put her on the search and detain list
take her off the list
there's no procedure for that until she is been arrested
say it was a mistake
we do not make mistakes

but you fellas never get a break do you

i am not dyle  you know that
but tex did not  he still thought  
do not be an idiot
i am through listening to you
then who did you are the only one left
do not be a fool he is carson dyle
you lied to me so many times 
reggie  trust me once more  please
can i really believe you this time adam

here give it to me
the truth now  was it my hide  or the stamps

i heard you i heard you
then say it
reggie  listen to me 
never mind  i will go by myself
mrs lampert  mrs charles lampert
come in mrs lampert you are quite late
charles lampert's widow  yes  last time i sent out a tie only the spot came back
no thanks
i do not suppose it is an airline is it
central intelligence agency  cia
you mean spies and things like that
only we call them agents
we you mean you are 
someone has to do it mrs lampert 
i am sorry it is just that i did not think that you people were supposed to admit 
that is all this got to do with me mr bartholomew
your husband was wanted by the u s government
may i have a sandwich please
so that was it
yes we knew him of course by his real name
his  real  
are not they  now look at this one mrs voss and 
stop calling me that lampert's the name on the marriage license
yes  and tell me if you recognize anyone just a moment have a good look
danger why should i be in any danger
you are charles voss's wife  now that he is dead you are their only lead
mr bartholomew  if you are trying to frighten me you are doing a really firstrate job 
please do what we ask mrs lampert  it is your only chance
gladly only i do not know what you want you have not told me
oh mrs lampert i would love to see you try and convince them of that  oh dear
then whose is it his or theirs
and i am afraid we want it back
but i do not have it
that is impossible you are the only one who could have it
i am sorry it is impossible it is the truth
thanks very much
oh you have got the money all right  you just do not know you have got it
mr bartholomew  if i had a quarter of a million dollars believe me i would know it
nevertheless mrs lampert  you have got it
you mean it is just lying around someplace  all that cash
we have no proof of course but we rather think so yes
well there you are charles had the money with him  so whoever killed him has it  they have it
because they are still here
yes where   in fifteen minutes i will be there
were you followed
what does your mr dyle look like mrs lampert
he is hardly my mr dyle
describe him
that is not carson dyle
you mean you have known about him all along why did not you tell me
i did not see any point dyle's dead
dead mr bartholomew  maybe you would better tell me what this thing's all about
barely yes
mrs lampert i really had not planned on spending the entire night here
can i at least keep the onion soup
please go on mr bartholomew  what happened then
scobie was able to travel but carson dyle was clearly dying so they 
cia mrs lampert we are an extension of the wartime oss it was our money and we want it back
that is the spirit
oh stop it what do you want me to do
we are anxious to know who this man is  the one calling himself dyle
maybe he really is dyle he could still be alive
no mrs lampert
but no one actually saw him die
no mrs lampert his death is registered with the war department in washington
oh then who's this one
i do not know  but i think you would better find out do not you
me why me
you are in an ideal position  he trusts you  besides you said yourself women make the best spies
go ahead mr bartholomew  i am listening
none whatsoever please mrs lampert  be careful
very good
he looks so young  when was this taken
1944 the next face please
do you know him mrs vo  mrs lampert leopold w gideon
herman scobie and you have never seen him before either
no thank heaven
crooked i should think you would be glad to find out i was not crooked
you could not even be honest about being dishonest why did not you say something
we are not allowed to tell may i have the stamps please
here   wait a minute  how did carson dyle get an office in here anyway
when did you see him  what time i mean
around one
mrs foster  send a memo to bartholomew at security recommending that 
starting with his own
okay now  hand over those stamps
that is your first name today
who asked you to get stuck with any of them
is there a mrs cruikshank
only if you can prove to me that you are really brian cruikshank
how about if next week some time i put it on a marriage license  that ought to 
quit stalling  i want to see some identification  now
i would not lie on a thing like that  i could go to jail
you would lie about anything
well maybe we would better forget about it then
you cannot prove it can you you are still trying to   marriage license did you say  
i did not say anything will you give me those stamps
you will wreck your raincoat
we wait  with our mouths shut
i said with the mouth shut
okay  up there
open it
the view had better be worth it
i will give you a chance dyle  which is more than you would give me where is the money
supposing i did have it  which i do not  do you really think i would hand it over
you are out dyle  right now
that is the idea
then who does
i do not know herman  maybe you do
that is wrong herman  have you got something to hide  then i take it there are no objections
i will take that
no cat and mouse  you have got me what do you want to know
why you lied to me
i had to  for all i knew you could have been in on the whole thing
well you know now so please tell me who you are
but you know my name  it is dyle
carson dyle is dead
yes he is he was my brother
i met a man with sharp nails
come on  i have got something that stings like crazy
have not you got a bullet i can bite
would you like to see my passport
your passport what kind of a proof is that
would you like to see where i was tattooed
ha ha you could at least tell me what your first name is these days
yes but we are divorced
i thought that was peter joshua
i am no easier to live with than he was
there  you are a new man
you cannot
there must be some way
because he is wearing moccasins
oh well then he is a truthful whitefoot of course
why not a lying blackfoot
which one are you
whitefoot of course
come here
reggie  listen to me 
ohoh  here it comes the fatherly talk you forget i am already a widow
so was juliet  at fifteen
i am not fifteen
well there's your trouble right there  you are too old for me
why cannot you be serious
there you said it
said what
cutting it out
who told you to do that
you did
but i am not through complaining yet
i think i love you alex 
whoever it is will not give up  and neither will i
that sounds like their problem
i will be right there
i would better call sylvie  she must be frantic
scobie  he is the one that objected
do women think it is feminine to be so illogical  or cannot they help it
that is so illogical about that
i am sorry
do not worry i am not going to hit you
no about scobie i mean i cannot think of any reason why he was killed
let me know what you want  i will pick a suit that matches
did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf
the shower's in there
this is a ludicrous situation there must be dozens of men dying to use my shower
then i suggest you call one of them
i dare you
have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on  what a nut
shut the door
i do not think i know that one
how often do you go through this little ritual
i do not believe it
i keep thinking about charles and scobie  and the one who's going to be next  me
nothing's going to happen to you while i am around  i want you to believe that
it is a start anyway
i cannot very well leave without a pair of water wings
okay then get set for the story of my life  not that it would ever make the bestseller list
fiction or nonfiction
why do not you shut up
go on
it led me away from umbrella frames for one thing but that left me without any honest means of support
what do you mean
well i cannot really blame you  not now
i was expecting you you are american too of course
i am  i am sorry  i do not know anything about stamps
the money is unimportant
i am afraid it is important
in your money perhaps $65000
do you mind if i sit down  what about the blue one
in human life in greed in suffering
in money
fortyfive thousand
do you have anything to eat  and the orange one  what about the orange one
a twopenny mauritius  issued in 1856 not so rare as the others  $30000 perhaps
and the last one
i am a tradesman madame not a doorman and do not forget these
no for a few minutes they were mine  that is enough
that is right  it is like tickling a alligator's belly
and if it is
why bother him
no the police have kindly provided us with a list
not unless we are blind
you think that mebbe we are fishing the wrong stream
meaning what
nachurly jus' like i would tell you
nachurly and that goes for herman too
the kid said 
what do you want
did not charles tell you mrs lampert
tell me what
it does not belong to you mrs lampert  you do know that do not you
i do not know anything
mrs lampert any morning now you could wake up dead
leave me alone  
dead mrs lampert  like last week's news  like charles mrs lampert 
stop it
but his mother 
she is not going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions
i am very cold
i am very confused
he did not have one
he was a wealthy man
i do not know i suppose so
about how wealthy would you say
i do not know
where did he keep his money
i do not know
besides yourself who is his nearest relation
i do not know
c'est absurde madame totalement absurde
i know  i am sorry
it is all right
i wish you would not
obviously  one ticket of passage to south america  one letter stamped but unsealed addressed to you 
a letter may i see it
did you
is that all can i go now
one more question is this your husband's passport
and this
and this and this
in mr dyle's room
no  in my room
it stands to reason you are telling the truth  for why would you invent such a ridiculous story
do not tell me you did not know it was loaded  sylvie
 you could have the stamps i will get you some here okay
what should we give him
i know i would bury it in the garden
swell  only this man does not have a garden
oh  neither do i  voil
voil what
up there i would put it up there
if you think you are getting credit for this you are crazy
we won we won
no jeanlouis
a man traded with me  all those for only four
oh no what man jeanlouis   where
i do not blame him jeanlouis  do you know where this monsieur flix lives
no  but i will ask
it is hers where would you find him robbing a bank
he was throwing snowballs at baron rothschild  we do not know each other do we
why do you think we are going to
i do not know  how would i know
you give up awfully easy do not you
i am afraid you are blocking my view
sorry which view would you like
i am regina lampert
is there a mr lampert
no it is not i am getting a divorce
please not on my account
no you see i do not really love him
well you are honest anyway
yes i am  i am compulsive about it  dishonesty infuriates me like when you go into a drugstore
i am not sure i 
is there a mrs joshua
yes but we are divorced
that was not a proposal  i was just curious
is your husband with you
now you are angry
no i am not  i have got some packing to do i am also going back to paris today
oh well was not it shakespeare who said when strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again
shakespeare never said that
how do you know
it is terrible  you just made it up
well the idea's right anyway are you going to call me
are you in the book
charles is
is there only one charles lampert
it is in all the afternoon papers i am very sorry
thank you
yes it is  i heard it this morning
charles sold it all  at auction

the library i will be fine
who is she
she is nobody you should be concerned with
she was raped at least that is what she claimed
you did not believe her
no i believed her she was in pretty bad shape inside and out but the boys were never formally charged
why not
everyone just kind of looked the other way
how could you

fuck you
it is the same thing with veronica
leave her out of this
you are wrong things happened today okay things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin
melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement
jesus h christ i cannot
so you will continue being miserable all the time just because you do not have the guts to face change
point isi am not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably
the swelling's not so bad but the fds stings  how is your neck
it is hard to swallow
why the fuck did you tell veronica that i was going to dump her for caitlin
i thought i was doing you a favor
oh please i am surprised i did not kill you
why do you say that
why do i say that  randal forget it
no really what did i do that was so wrong
what time did you get to work today
like ten after
you were over half an hour late then all you do is come over here
to talk to you
which means the video store is ostensibly closed
it is not like i am miles away
unless you are out renting videos at other video stores
hermaphrodites i rented it so we could watch it together
you need a ride
got one just pulled up
same time what about you
i am calling out going to hit the hospitalsee how caitlin is then try to see veronica
you wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night after i get out of here
i will call you let you know
all right good luck with veronica if you want i can talk to her you know and explain
no thanks i will take care of it we have got a lot of shit to talk about
helluva day
to say the least
i am gone i will talk to you tomorrow
i know i can bench more than that
i do not have love handles
you remember alyssa jones she hung out with
caitlin bree yeah
i am her sister
you are alyssa's sister heather
yep i remember you got caught in my parents' room with caitlin once
caitlin used to talk about him all the time
jesus christ what next
excuse me
i heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag that milk only weighs about seven pounds
i did not strain i sighed
yes they are you are out of shape
what are you talking about there's no fat on this body
no fat but no tone either you do not get enough exercise
how much can you bench
i do not know
how do you know that
oh man hey you still going out with her
no she is getting married
to you
all the time that girl was like a rabbit
i i do not believe this
hey man that was a long time ago do not let it get to you
about the biggest pair you ever seen nynne
yeah you cocksmoking clerk
how many times i gotta tell you not to deal outside the store
i am not dealing
pay the good man  do not you close soon
a half hour
we get off about the same time every night we should hang out  you get high
i should start
wanna come to this party tonight there's gonna be some pussy there man
with you i do not think so
listen to you oh shit oh i do not hang out with drug dealers
nothing personal
how do you figure hey you cannot roll a joint in here
and these are not my drugsi just sell them
the difference is you exploit a weakness
that is that mean
you sell to people that cannot stay away from an addiction
all right how much is pepsi here
a dollar sixtynine plus tax
at food city it is ninetynine cents plus tax
hey man what happened with that old guy
he died in the bathroom
that is fucked up yo i heard he was jerking off
i do not know i was not watching
you used to go out with her
we were going to start again i think
do not you already have a girlfriend
damn she sure goes out of her way
she is my girlfriend
you calling me a liar
no he was probably just resting his eyes
what the hell is that resting his eyes it is not like he is some goddamned air traffic controller
actually that is his night job
do not hurt yourself i am going to big choice video instead
i am trying
you know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer
so i am told
i had a friend that used to chew glass for a living in the circus
no he got hit by a bus
oh can i help you
well that depends do you have a bathroom
um yeah but it is for employees only
thanks son saywhat kind of toilet paper you got back there
the white kind
i am not asking about the color i mean is it rough or cottony
actually it is kind of rough
aw c'mon boy that is the difference you said yourself the stuff that is there now is rough
yeah okay go ahead
thanks son you are a lifesaver
thanks young man you have got a heart of gold
can i trouble you for one of those magazines
i said go ahead
no i mean the ones there behind the counter
yeah i like the cartoons they make me laugh they draw the biggest titties
here now leave me alone
uh can i have the other one the one below this one they show more in that one
too hard i do not have enough indignities in my lifepeople start throwing cigarettes at me
at least they were not lit
i hate this fucking place
then quit you should be going to school anyway
please veronica last thing i need is a lecture at this point
all i am saying is that if you are unhappy you should leave
i am not even supposed to be here today
i know i stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something
the guy got sick and could not come in
do not you have a hockey game at two
yes and i am going to play like shit because i did not get a good night's sleep
why did you agree to come in then
i am only here until twelve then i am gone the boss is coming in
why do not you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here
somebody jammed the locks with gum
you are kidding
bunch of savages in this town
you look bushed what time did you get to bed
i do not knowlike twothirty three
what were you doing up so late
hunhh nothing
what were you doing
nothing jesus i gotta fight with you now
who's fighting why are you so defensive
she called you did not she
why do you say that
how do you know they are taking the right amount of change or even paying for what they take
theoretically people see money on the counter and nobody around they think they are being watched
honesty through paranoia why do you smell like shoe polish
i had to use shoe polish to make that sign the smell will not come off
do you think anyone can see us down here
why you wanna have sex or something
ooh can we
yeah right you cannot get enough of me
typically male point of view
how do you figure
you show some bedroom proficiency and you think you are gods what about what we do for you
women women as lovers are all basically the same they just have to be there
be there
making a male climax is not all that challenging insert somewhere close and preferably moist thrust repeat
how flattering
now making a woman cum therein lies a challenge
oh you think so
a girl makes a guy cum it is standard a guy makes a girl cum it is talent
and i actually date you
something wrong
i am astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life
it was not directed at you i was making a broad generalization
you were making a generalization about broads
these are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me
how many
how many what
how many girls have you slept with
how many different girls did not we already have this discussion once
we might have i do not remember how many
including you
it better be up to and including me
including you yes
you are a pig
why would you hit me
do you know how many different men i have had sex with
do i get to hit you after you tell me
you have only had sex with three different people
i am not the pig you are
john franson and rob stanslyk
wow that is great that is something to be proud of
vegetable meaning paraplegic
they put up the least amount of struggle
after dropping a bombshell like that you owe me big
all right name it
i want you to come with me on monday
cannot we ever have a discussion without that coming up
unlike you i have a class in forty five minutes
sylvan made it up it is a blow job thing
what do you mean
he gets off on it
sylvan can be talked into anything
why do you say that
like you saidshe snowballed him
sylvan no i snowballed him
yeah right
i am serious
yeah how do you think i know he liked
but but you said you only had sex with three guys you never mentioned him
that is because i never had sex with him
you sucked his dick
we went out a few times we did not have sex but we fooled around
oh my god why did you tell me you only slept with three guys
because i did only sleep with three guys that does not mean i did not just go with people
oh my godi feel so nauseous
i am sorry dante i thought you understood
i did understand i understand that you slept with three different guys and that is all you said
please calm down
how many

i had to tell someone he put it into perspective
what did he say
at least he was not thirtysix

the ostrich syndrome if you do not see it

that is how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out  a lot of people are after you jerry
dead or alive they will stick me in there with oswald  another lunatic acting alone
oswald was an assassin  you are not an assassin are you jerry
if you are worried about the president call and warn him about the space shuttle
right  sit up so i can see you
uh uh do not want uthemu to see me
them who
change lanes  then watch your rearview
as opposed to
i noticed
nothing is easy
how long have we known each other jerry
six months  eleven days
yeah  i think so
oh well maybe to the untrained eye  hmm ahh  ooooo
i have no idea
i am not sure  i think i figured something out  it must have been in my newsletter
what newsletter
you are certifiable
you would not be sitting here if you did not halfway believe me
believe you about what
flesh wound  no big deal
surprise me
um coffee  if that is okay
this would be it
are these yours
absolutely not  a good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy  if you can figure it out they screwed it up
yeah how many subscribers do you have
just five  it is the economy you think maybe one of them is not who they seem
you got a list
never heard of him
you have ten copies of the book but you do not know who the main character is
getting rid of my hub
uh huh
has this happened to you before
never but i have been practicing
who are you jerry
just a guy trying to put out a fire
so that is the question
how is it possible
is this your dad
that was him
is he dead
please put it down
how would he die
he was murdered
not this again
fuck you  i know you are crazy but fuck you
what van
never mind  you would think i was making it up
where would you get your subscribers
i put an ad on a computer bulletin board  i log on at the library so i cannot be traced
well i have been tracking them down all morning
you have not been bothering them have you
realized what
henry finch  that they monitor everything  that it was only a matter of time  and now four people are dead
latest casualty  ernest harriman you heard of him
sure one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago
his obituary was in every paper but not one of them said he was murdered
it said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool  uin newportu
they are big details jerry
do you watch the news  read the paper  last week this whole place was underwater
a water main broke
you will
if that is what you want  yes
oh christ here it comes  look i know you think i am crazy  i do not think i am but
jerry i 
what if i reached a point where you did not think i was crazy anymore  if i was normal
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking cocacola again
yeah  would you i mean could you love me then  if i was normal  maybe
do not do this to yourself  jerry you do not love me
holes  i do not know what you are talking about
yesterday you were wondering about the wall  how it was possible
now's not really the time to get into this 
i do not  i know you would not
i thought you  why  love ruins everything does not it
it would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you  but first things first
there's a car following us probably another one flanking us the next street over
not today
this way
where are we going jerry
reagan did not die  if he had died everybody would know what johnny's middle name was
come on
is that what they told you
did you kill my father
he gave it to me
i do not understand
where were you the day he died
at a horse show
that is the last time you rode is not it  do you think it was your fault  is that why
did you kill my father
then tell me what happened
because he believed me
you do
they will trace it
i am sorry
it is okay  you  you thought i was bad
jerry  ujerryu
you saw me standing alone 
without a love of my own
you knew just what i was there for
i spent two years here  this used to bring the medcart  demerol phenobarb  it is jacob's ladder
what about you
get up there and we will get it back down here for me  unowu
it is up  love gives you wings you can fly away from here
do not do this
i cannot promise you anything
top pocket  go on
you think it is a conspiracy
do not know but he looks a lot more like rosie o wouldonnel than ben franklin
now she tells me
yes you do jerry  quite well
that is great  good for you
who have you been talking to jerry  who else knows what you know
could you be a little more specific
lysergic acid diethylamide with a little kicker of my own  surely it must be coming back to you by now
you have never seen her run
then i cannot be hurt anymore
you are welcome  where is my partner
you should think of me as liza suttongs guardian angel
that is ironic  because we are here to protect her from you
you are here because you figured i might show up
it seemed like a possibility what about your intentions  are they honorable
i am leaning toward no
we got someone watching her 24 hours a day  she 
that is not what i mean  i want to see her
i do not know
then screw you  i will rot
alright  you can see her  but she cannot see you
a dog bit it
excuse me
you were going to ask about my nose  the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today
and you feel bad for it
it was my dog  let me ask you a question  how long have you been acquainted with jerry
you already asked me that  why do you insist on making me repeat myself
and you have no idea where he lives
you have asked me that one three times
uwhy youu
honestly  i think he has a crush on me
a charming term  now uwhy himu
excuse me
jerry's visits to your office why do you tolerate them  why him
the truth shall make you free
that is it  i went to yale  i hope you will not hold that against me
only on the football field
we are very specialized
brain washing mind control that sort of thing
please sit
it was mind control  umanchurianu ucandidateu kind of stuff right
a vulgar pop term but yes  take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin  that was our goal
ask what you can do for your country  that kind of thing
mk ultra was terminated in 1973 but not the research it was renamed  ex catcher
as in ucatcher in the ryeu
i am impressed  we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card
it was  it was
and what did i say
a dog
umy dogu  one i intend to put to sleep  extrapolate from there
these things you are talking about you did them to jerry
yes that is right
jerry is dangerous  jerry has killed 
i do not believe you
you do recognize it then
it was my father's  kept it in his wallet  he was murdered 
i know the story  a federal judge  he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial

walters had nothing to do with your father's murder

i just want to go home   can we go home now
we all agree with the doctor dear he thinks it is safer for you to stay here for a while
ruth's already taken him home

you too mom
you are looking good    a little thin but good
we have not i wanted to talk that over with you too

it is good exercise mom
i have already made arrangements

sounds awful i guess we better check it out
green spot
mottled really   green and red
to talk  well ok that might be good
i understand you just got engaged maybe that is where we should start
it is ok   it is good to let it out
i guess so i think that is right
i am glad
i answered these questions last night
it is ok it is not a passfail kind of thing
sometimes my food and my clothes and my underwear
by color
what if it is got a pattern
is this really important because i do not think it is a problem
that must be really difficult
you took bets on my diagnosis
it is no big deal   we all compare
who do you think you are
i am not the one who's masquerading as a doctor i am not the one who's who's
anything interesting
i have already checked it out 17 times
i was not hungry
john even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into mrs hallstrom's milk
finally i was getting tired of watching him try every night
was it bad newsthe visit from peter
very romantic setting
it was romantic   he is very romantic
so are you engaged or what
it is magic
enough with the abracadabra
ok ok i will give it back
good god
a small price
i will not do your portion of kitchen cleanup
no rounds for another three hours
do not be ridiculous
rendezvous at the closet in 30
the lady knows this is a dandelion
a rose is a rose
backtoback sessions with the shrink
really    me too
that is my rap
schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions
what are the delusions like
sure but i took out a whole grocery store
i wish i could have seen that
i am starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent
i just want to see beast  where would you go
the mission up in santa barbara

that is where i always go when i get out
how can you even mention spaghetti o's after eating grandma rosa's dinner tonight

it is ok you do not have to say anything
but i do     i love you too
oh right     i am ready   how do i look

all over  did you see your new apartment
first off you will need to go to target and let's see what should you buy

we both talked to her michael and your dad
why would you tell
i did not talk to her about medications michael do not be silly
michael take it easy

i guess so
it is hard to know where to start
and all the plans we have
yeah the plans
someone has to take care of you right now michael you tore up the apartment you stopped taking your medications
but that was not me    i did not mean to do that
well then why would it happen
i do not know i do not fucking know
i did not mean for any of this to happen
oh god michael i know  why does everything have to be so hard
what do you want to do
i know i do not want to lose you     i do not think i could stand it
i love you too letty     i love you too
that is the best idea i have heard in a long time
how about something better   like a kiss

i will and you make sure you take care of yourself
you should go

she is only known the guy a few months
in there's better  it is kind of romantic do not you think
the receptionist said you called earlier about something

i mean tonight
oh ok   maybe
but i thought if you do not mind you could listen and see how i come across
sure of course
i am calling in sick
i do not feel like going to work today

paul i just cannot go is that ok with you or am i committing some horrible crime

no it is not like that
no i cannot i have already convinced both mom and dad to come
come on letty   it will get done
can you loan me a 20
sure why
i am going to the store
i think you are overreacting
yeah i guess it is all right
are you all right
that is a big question
i hope it was not something i did
something you did
i think we need to talk about some things
yes i suppose so
this has been really difficult this whole thing 
especially now
so i have been thinking a lot
i know we cannot just keep going through the motions
exactly it is time to make decisions
you do not have to say anything else i have known for a while that this was coming
i just wish we would done it sooner
or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients
so what do you say let
so will you
of course yes i will     i do
i need to tell you something and i am not sure how
i do not mean to hurt you    i know this is a terrible thing    and i have really loved you
have you been seeing another teacher
no way you keep the ring     you will come to your senses
i am just glad there are not any hard feelings
oh none none i completely understand what was going on
i start on monday
i heard about your friend
michael   yes
i am really sorry
sure i understand
i do apologize    a student had a crisis
i am glad you are doing well
i have already thought about how to tell the kids where i was
what does that mean
i need someone to work on budget projections
office work
or of course you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year
i will float you
shhh they are coming to the cubic zirconium
i like those sapphire earrings myself
simulated sapphires i bet my daughter would love those too
that is so sweet michael but really i have so many things to do
how is the arm  still sore
much better  you have been gone so long
li mu bai is coming to stay the night
i will go and make up his room
i did not have the heart
well li mu bai can do it
wait  i am a friend
why were you spying on the yus
i do as i please
that is it to you
then tell me where jade fox is
on guard
real sharpness comes without effort
i have always wanted a disciple worthy of wudangs secrets
and if i use them to kill you
that is it to you
tell me who is your master
let's go
why are you still here  you killed a policeman  you should leave you will bring ruin on my whole family
you are already a thief
that was just for fun  how can i leave  where would i go
wherever we want  we will get rid of anyone in our way  even your father
shut up
it is the giang hu fighter lifestyle kill or be killed exciting is not it
i owe you nothing
yes you do  you are still my disciple
i studied the diagrams  but you hid the details
do not bother
you do not seem to understand
so what if i do not
he is my defeated foe
i have made you silk pajamas  do you want to change into them
put them down
i heard you met shu lien today
do you know her
she is one of those  your mother would not want you consorting with her kind
do not invite danger into your father's house
go to bed then  miss has grown up and is getting married soon  god knows what the future will bring
it will be just the same  enough i am tired
autumn is coming  i will shut the windows for you
i have a guest
my friend li mu bai  he is given it to sir te as a gift
li mu bai  the famous warrior why would he give his sword to sir te
you are too young to understand
you are a sword fighter too
fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we would not survive for long
i have read all about people like you roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way
writers would not sell many books if they told how it really is
but you are just like the characters in the stories
sure  no place to bathe for days sleeping in fleainfested beds they tell you all about that in those books
you know what i mean  i am getting married soon but i have not lived the life i want
so i heard  congratulations  it is the most important step in a womangs life is not it
you are not married are you
what do you think
no  you could not roam around freely if you were
you are probably right
how so
i am bored
i will write your name  just for fun
maybe it is  i would not know
about you and li mu bai
yes  did you know i was once engaged to be married
no really
i am not an aristocrat as you are but i must still respect a womangs duties
do not distance us  from now on let's be like sisters
then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage
yes from the west  he went undercover and and followed her here
i am just borrowing some clean clothes  i am not staying
i will give them to you
i was just passing by and wondered how you were
go back to them first  then you can decide about lo
you know about lo
he really loves you  come back to peking with me  we will find a solution
where is he now
li mu bai has made arrangements he sent him to wudan mountain
you are working together to set me up  i am leaving
come and get it if you can
without the green destiny you are nothing
do not be a sore loser  go ahead take your pick  i will wait  go ahead
spare your energy  i will be back
not another lecture  on guard
let's end this here
only the sword will settle this
what i have always wanted to teach you
all right  if you can take back the sword in three moves i will go with you
give it back
you are tired  you need rest  your horse needs water  there's a creek up here
you coward
still in a bad mood  at least you are speaking  that is your name
it is mine  it means a lot to me a barbarian like you would not understand
not true  i can use it to pick fleas from my horse
by the way i am a real manchurian
i am sorry i guessed wrong  i though you were a han
give me back my comb
i do not take orders from anyone
give it back
i am a man  and now i have found the brightest star of all
let them look
it is trouble for me
i will
if you do not i will come after you and i will not let you off so easy
a faithful heart makes wishes come true
make a wish lo
it has  how is business
good  and how are you
i left the training early
why  you are a wudan fighter training is everything
something i cannot let go of  you are leaving soon
we are preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me
i am  he has always been our greatest protector
i do not understand  how can you part with it  it has always been with you
too many men have died at its edge it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade
you use it justly you are worthy of it
it is time for me to leave it behind
so what will you do now
but something is going on at the yu household
what have you discovered
you always suspected she would fled to the west
i did not think she would dare come back to peking
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu
so i shall avenge my master's death after all
have you questioned him yet
no not yet
but your men are watching over yu's compund
what do you mean  did not you come back here for it
i do not know it was stolen until i got here
then why did you come
well we had talked
but it is not your sword anymore you gave it to sir te
i knew she would intrigue you
she needs direction and training
but wudan does not accept women
for her they might make an exception  if not i am afraid she will become a poisoned dragon
it is not our affair  even if wudan accepts her her husband might object
i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world but the cycle of bloodshed continues
i wish there were something more i could do to help you
just be patient with me shu lien
all right  i will write you an introduction  take it to wudan wait there for news from me
your hand rough and callused from machete practice all this time i have never had the courage to touch it
what about you
i will look around and catch up later
not a bad idea  tonight we will get a good night's sleep at headquarters
jade fox drugged her  how did you get here
we followed jade fox
shu lien
save your strength
my life is departing  i have only one breath left
i am sorry she is not feeling well enough to receive you today
i heard sir te lost something  and now madame te's not feeling well
sir te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families
but do not be too lenient
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking
a murderer
i doubt it  this thief it very unusual
we must avenge mother
what does it say
we will settle this at midnight on yellow hill  good the fox is out of her hole
father  let me avenge my mother's death
li mu bai giving up his sword and his warrior days maybe he is trying to tell you something
i do not know
yes though i doubt he is involved in this
but the sword could be in his compound
then someone's trying to set him up we should inform li mu bai
sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter
what do you have in mind
the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs
annette harrison
i do not think so
did you know sebastian well
you might say that
now i remember annette harrison your father's the new headmaster at oakwood
that is right
i am sure you are going to love it there
i will be fine
well i will leave you alone now i just came in here to get something of mine
excuse me
you heard me
sebastian was a pathological liar i would not believe a word he 
i have his journal
you what
actually i was planning on running down to kinkos do you think you could give me ride
you cannot do this to me it could ruin me
i know
really i thought he said it all the time
that is not his style one thing i can say about valmont he always speaks the truth
no i mean i do not know  what else do you know about him
not a whole lot we take some classes together he is got a bad rep but it is mostly bullshit
what do you mean
well a lot of people are jealous cause he is loaded
i do not know i have been hearing some awful things about him

i cannot tell you i am sworn to secrecy
on my mother's life
i do not know relationships seem too distracting i would rather concentrate on my studies
you a lesbo
i was just being honest you happen to have a nice ass sorry
you did
i must say i found it rather appalling
that is a first most people praised me for it
most people are morons i mean who are you to knock what you have never experienced
take yourself you have slept with several women are you happier because of it
how do you know i have been with several women
a friend wrote me
well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip
i am sorry i did not mean to upset you but you still did not answer the question
it is not really important
fine forget it it is obvious that we are not going to be friends
why are you being so dramatic
you talking to me

what do you mean
i would be careful if i were you god knows what he is up to
he does not scare me i will kick his ass in
i am just taking the poor girl under my wing
hopefully though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid
so that is what this is all about  we will get together and plan your curriculum
i need you to seduce our young cecile introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery
sounds intriguing
she is quite cute you know young supple breasts a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie
that was just simple revenge what i have planned requires sheer genius
shut up and turn to page 64
care to make a wager on that
i will think about it
oh well duty calls time to add another chapter to my work of art
could you be more desperate to read it
if you lose then that hot little porsche of yours is mine
and if i win
be more specific
in english  i will fuck your brains out
what makes you think i would go for that bet that is a seventy thousand dollar car
because i am the only person you cannot control and it kills you
even there
it would feel so yummy
i am working on it
call me later
ooo i am sure mrs caldwell will love that
not to mention court reynolds unfortunately ronald's moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder
that is your plan of attack
i rat cecile out to mommy mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship boo hoo
but who will they turn to for help
thank you mmmm that feels good
oh sis you are so tense
i hate it too
have you succeeded in your task
any day now
well let me know when you do until then
take a look for yourself
that is your problem
i am not losing the bet it is just taking longer than i expected
do you mind if i take my new porsche for a ride
with who
she shot you down
exactly the opposite
so what went wrong
a momentary lapse of judgment soon to be rectified
where is she
you do not know  she left thirty minutes ago

do not worry
do not worry about it
and we are going away for a holiday
for a month

right and do not embellish
i promise  i will not
oh sure  remember the convention speech
i mean  if it is a problem
what the hell is this 
 listen you little
well it is a last minute change
you mean the press conference  i have a couple of ideas i wanted to share with the country
i am not nobody
you are lint  you are a flea  you are a blip
well maybe i am  but you are fired
i cannot believe he would do this
i know
she is a little hysterical right now we have got her upstairs in a laundry room
do not call the vice president
the guy's in a coma bob
i do not give a shit
tilt we figure something out
bob the guy had a stroke
like how
well start by going on television and saying that he is had a mild stroke
mild stroke
yes   and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon
up and around  soon
exactly a condition
i was a senator you know
duane's guys but he is got them under control
what about her
i just hope this yutz can pull it off
the guy's a boy scout bob  he declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return
we have got nothing bob  this will not work
are you out of your mind
you scheduled a whole day with the first lady
it is a homeless shelter
oh  excuse me
it is gonna be great  'caring about his wife'  'spending time on her favorite issue'
i do not want him caring about his wife what about the vice president
remember that first liberty stuff we almost got nailed on
and look at this  russell came around on the trade bill
you are kidding
how long have you been waiting to pass that thing
three years
dave these things get awfully complicated sometimes
hundredth cabinet meeting  i thought it was a nice touch
oh  fine
i do not think so
i am going to kill him
you cannot kill a president
he is only doing what you told him to
what i told him to
he was only doing his job
i will lock him away for good
then we will all go to jail together
just what you think i mean
are you threatening me
sort of yeah
dave  i am working
oh yeah me too  you want to get dinner later
i was gonna do something with joan
oh okay  i will catch ya tomorrow then
it is fine
they could put you in jail
why would they do that  they hired me
this is undeclared income
and who's gonna find out
the government
i am the government
i just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be
i am not surprised  can we save anywhere
well yeah  but you gotta start making some choices
you could buy it on payments
yeah  that is how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit
so what do we do
that would be great
well  take care
oh yeah 1'm fine
extend things
extend them  c'mere for a second
well it is  it is sort of an an incident'  really
oh my gosh
oh yeah probably
really   crazy
i am not sure i might have
now  let's say the whole country was in that car   the entire united states of america
in the car
in the car
i see what you mean
i do not think so
at a press conference
 somewhere there is a distant light guiding us through this rocky shoal'
it is just five minutes  she comes in you wave to the press she leaves
yeah but the first lady could not we start with a cousin or something
she hardly ever sees him and it will be so fast she will not have a chance to tell
we vetoed that
right  we can pick up on the rest tomorrow
we had to dave the guy's a choir boy
this is wrong alan
absolutely  well that might be kind of tough once the press starts smelling blood
he is not
you are spending fortythree million dollars on an ad campaign to  'boost consumer confidence in the american auto industry'
and it is proving quite effective
does it make the cars any better
no  sir  it is more of a perceptual issue
so we are spending fortyseven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they have already bought
yes but i would not
oh thanks
and these are a gift from the king of to go
fertility beads
what do you mean
i just fired bob alexander
dirty business we are in sometimes
yeah sometimes they do
oh kinda the same way
you are not
i cannot say
you mean you do not know or like  you cannot say
i cannot say
of course
what about it
well is that really true i mean would you really get killed just to save his life
but it is tenthirty at night
i had a feeling
bleed for your king'
that is that
no they do not kid
yeah but bob found me when i was stuck in firearms and tobacco
that is okay  you alright down here by yourself
oh sure  do not worry about it
oh right  you know ever since the stroke
no thanks  it is not that far

i am outta here
thanks for doing this ellen
you do not change do you bill
yeah  i am sure it is keeping you up nights

anybody would have done it
oh i do not think so  still you helped a lot of people
oh yeah  me too
you were not in the state legislature
i do not know
i am sure they did  'state of emergency'  'national security' you ever hear of the constitution
i am not the first lady anymore  i should not be here
where are you going
oh they did not brief you on that how sloppy of them
you1re leaving too
i never wanted to hurt anybody  in fact i even thought i was helping
i do not know  i had not thought it out that far
truman used it all the time
i do not mind
oh okay
he was not always like that anyway

you have a lot of secrets
i guess
you mean when i am not running the country
you find people jobs
yeah  is that funny
it is just more than anybody else does around here
well do not get carried away  i am not that good at it
i know
but you could go to jail for it
it was inspirational
yeah bedtime
i know i am sorry
i mean i want to i just i feel strange
that is okay

how you doing in there hero
what happened when eugene tried to kill himself out of turn

and when it was rory's turn to die and thomas was in the way
speed up

he probably already knows we are coming
taken care of
do not sweat it  it is over
she had the baby
random sure
what you think death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago  you are nuts
being alive after our time caused an outward ripple  a rift in death's design
that lucky bastard
what about the rest of you  kimberly you were driving to daytona  was route 18 your first choice
what about you kimberly  did you anyone from flight
blow me
yeah you should have specified

how are we going to find her  there must be thousands of white vans in this state
hey i am a police officer remember
are you thinking what i am thinking
how do you know
you said she was going to drive into a lake  how can she when she is in protective custody
he cannot breathe damn it  i think his lung's collapsed
do not worry  nothing can happen to us
i was not worried about us
no time  keep going  i would not know how to explain any of this anyway
i know how it feels to be dead
i do notwhat if i made a mistake

oh for pity's sake
where you are going mister
very big
i opened thousands of brains
what did you find
big mess every time
you are going where
what do you mean we must abandon
ruptured steam pipe
contaminated substance very dangerous shooting mud
do not inhale
that is where i peed
paisley porter i did not know you were waiting tables
elliot litvak have you been ill and mr rogan how nice
alla puttanesca
is not she great what did i tell you a talent
i do not want to hear about it
shut up elliot
quietly effective
press a button and they give us money
ride with me we need a haircut
she wants a divorce
do not talk like that
it is over finished and done with
that sounds so final but are we really surprised
i am completely stunned i do not want this to happen
but did not we know it would happen
asbestos lining
we must abandon
do not inhale
i can tell you the year the day the night the minute
you used to love life you do not exude this any more
what do i exude
suffering you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread
tonight you find out what it means to suffer
tonight that is tonight
shit they do not have any carrot soup
you mean because that ishisname
you will suffer because he is in the theater and you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears
it is just a review
it is just a review do not inhale very dangerous
that is the fuss i do not get it
that is what i said eighteen months ago
what happened eighteen months ago
steven schwimmer i memorized every word of this review
that is awful
i recite it to myself with masochistic relish
a year and a half later you are still brooding
i said i am dead' he killed me
do we care
i think we nought to wait
i say we go
you say we go
do not inhale
i am not ready
here we go
do not wait efor me
what about the haircut
then you should carry a gun
where is it
i gave it away i thought i am a writer now
that was a big mistake
no we are not
i am not a lonely spooky writer like you nursing a hundred grudges i am a man who loves life
we are talking about something deeper than grudges how do we respond to personal attack
it is your best play nicky
he will hate it
the american theater does not need people like that
shoot him nicky not that we really mean it but where does he live
keep going west last building before the river
how do you eknow
paisley porter
what do you mean
she was very evasive
what are you talking about
what are we talking about
yes what are you implying
did you see the winning run score
you are not making sense make sense
this could be it
let's work on it
let's work on it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
does it feel comfortable
does what feel comfortable
this could be it
this could be it
i hear alangs sick
alangs very sick he has to go to new mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution
you know about adele
what about her
she is dying
she died
i talked to her two days ago
apparently it did not help you know about peter of course
our peter
steven schwimmer the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan
look all i want is a haircut i am not worried about this guy
ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater nobody in this business has been worried about anything else
they can send their heartless brilliant boycritic there's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening
you mean the world series i thought the red sox were winning
this is how we have managed to last
we are able to surprise each other
in and out of bed
because we are completely mismatched
we do not even like each other do we
it is all worked out they will lose tonight then they will lose tomorrow i see it with stunning clarity
it is your best play nicky
they will lose because they are my team
he will absolutely hate it
i go to college i thought you knew
do you want to get some coffee
i do not drink coffee daddy and this is not what we should be talking about
what do you want to talk about i will talk about anything that is this
why do you need a radio
is it
do not talk like that how prominent what are you implying
she is doing like those iranians i divorce thee i divorce thee i divorce thee'
and he hears it the same time i hear it what happened to family secrets
because they get outstanding settlements and mother is determined that this time there's no turning back
i just had breakfast with her she did not say a word about this
do not be so steelyeyed it is that course you are taking in criminology
she is kicking you out
i did not turn her into mother you did
this person and i are a thing of the total past i promise you
thanks daddy but i just need one mother's not going
opening night
i know  why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition
take it yourself take a date
i do not have a date i do not want a date
i have a class i am late
can we talk later will you be at the party
i am not sure
there's nothing left for me to lie about
daddy wait
it is only our first date
names are incredibly intimate we barely know each other trust me on this
first you tell me
brilliantly moving
packs an emotional wallop
what else
a flatout hit
what do we want
mystery deception
deception is not something i personally consider sexy
that is sexy
knowing who a person is down deep
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking
you will not even tell me your name that is shocking about a name
it is your best play nicky
see daddy
an artistry and sensitivity you have never shown before
twoall after six
i want to be fairminded nicky
all right that is been going on
i have been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer
how prominent
i do not want to be responsible for his food just a small green salad and a perrier
bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning
who the hell cares
the whole thing is my fault i took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding you understand me
that is always been my problem
and you have been extremely patient
you know why do not you because i am patient chainsmoking lillian
i went because you went you smoked because i smoked
that is very lovely actually
laurel wants us to be honest and open let's be open with each other
be open with me i would like that
there may be things you would rather not know about
i want to know we have not talked this way in years
i had an affair  are you sure you want to hear this
joanne bourne

where are you going now
no one's waiting
there's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid is that our steven
if i am sleeping with him and i have not said i am then so what
so everything that is so what so i begin to hate him so i want to do him grave harm
but you do not even know me how can you care what i do with whom
i know you both enough how much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy
do you want to talk about doing crazy things
our steven not only disguises himself
i am actually beginning to enjoy this
i have not come to you
but you are here so you must have come to me
and i thought at last she is here she wants me
i do not want you steven
i am going home to my machine

timmy this is gerry an old friend of mine we went to college together

suicide is a private thing
if everyone jumped off a bridge young lady would you
how very
no but if you are nice i will let you buy me a slurpee you know your 711speak pretty well
i do not know should you
everybody's life's got static is your life perfect
sure i am on my way to a party at remington university
i do not really like your friends either
it is like they are just people i work with and our job is being popular and shit
maybe it is time for a vacation
killing her will not solve anything
see the condoms in the grass over there we killed tonight veronica we murdered our baby
hey it was good for me too sparky
just saying it is not hard to end a life
there's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm
but before that i would like to see heather chandler puke her guts out
then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that will induce her to spew red white and blue
do not be a dick that stuff will kill her
okay we will use this she will not be able to tell what she is drinking
yeah great
no shit sherlock i cannot believe it i just killed my best friend
and your worst enemy
same difference oh jesus i am gonna
stop kidding around i am going to have to send my sat scores to san quentin instead of stanford
i am just a little freaked all right  you got what you wanted you know
like a suicide thing
adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion
i can do heather's handwriting as well as my own
to me though suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me
that is good but heather would never use the word myriad
that only proves my point more the word is a badge for her failures at school
that is good have you done this before
yeah scary stuff
my mom's making my favorite meal tonight spaghetti lots of oregano
our love is god let's get a slurpee
you cannot be serious hey listen my bonnieandclyde days are over

whaat come on there's another tv in the kitchen you know you used to have a sense of humor

oh good  well i hope you will have more to tell me next time
as long as you keep remembering why
well we talked about the whole disapproval thing
and please do not for god's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way 
no no no no
that would be monumentally stupid all i am saying is 
 a sense of proportion
a sense of proportion
who does not
i have cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever
well now do not go creating some artificial environment for yourself
i should
you have to put yourself out there a bit more
maybe i could take a look at it now
yeah that was easy
do you do washing machines too
just show me the way
is not that always the way
so you are just kind of a roving 
an occupational hazard i am afraid
i bet  going into people's homes
it is a living
uh no  i have never really found the time to settle down
you must value your independence
yeah i am okay  it is been a long night
what happened

i suppose
did you have sex with her
i was a mentor to her
i gave her things she did not have could not have
he  well he

then so was mine
do not you pull that shit with me
i did not want to kill her will
this an accident walter
if you want it to be
no backup
you are not following procedure
procedure went out the window a long time ago
drop the gun walter
your lips they did not move
they did but too fast for you to see them no magic just grace and speed
we had feared we were the only ones
but how did you come into existence
if there were a leader i would be the one
ah you have questions
what are we
nothing if not vampires
who made us what we are
surely you know the one who made you
but the one who made him who made the one who made him the source of all this evil
you mean we are not children of satan
then god does not exist
i have not spoken to him
and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil
you fell too much so much you make me feel
he knew nothing he just did not care
knew you mean he is
listen to me
your lover
no my beloved my child
if you say so you are innocent
i am not innocent but i am afraid she feels she is in danger from the others
she is
but why
it is already begun if you want to save her send her away
then i leave too
you said there were none
how he must have loved you
yes my god
yes i knew him knew him well enough not to mourn his passing
follow me  that way  through my cell 
i cannot save her
you cannot believe i would leave without her armand you must save her you have no choice
louis i cannot save her i will only risk losing you 
i do not believe you i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie
louis they cannot be brought back there are some things that are impossible even for me
you let them do it
louis i swear i did not
i knew i rescued you did not i from the terrible dawn
you were their leader they trusted you
you made me see their failings louis you made me look at them with your eyes
what a pair we are we deserve each other do not we
we are a pair and that is what counts
what night what do you mean
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year
i did not realise
is this my birthday
i have or there would be twice as many
but you are the fairest by far
you dress me like a doll you make my hair like a doll why
what you are you would be something other than you are
and if i cut my hair again
it will grow back again
stop her louis
did you do it to me
be glad i made you what you are you would be dead not if i had not
does it
not you my dear
you are a liar but you upset my plans
what plans
oh lestat i must do more than that i have brought a present for you
then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess
drunk on brandy wine a thimblefull i thought of you when i saw them
we forgive each other then
no laudanum
louis put me in my coffin
i will put you in your coffin forever
what have you done
the way i learn everything by watching you
lestat taught you all you need to know about that
infant death he calls me sweet daughter death you know what he calls you merciful death
he jests
why does he call you that
hush claudia do not talk about such things show me your book
sit still it is not finished 
claudia  do not 
why not
tell me whyyou have got to tell me
and it means something else too does not it i shall never ever grow up
i took your life he gave you another one
he will never let us go
do not mock me louis help me
the one good lesson he taught me louis never drink from the dead
do not mock claudia
the swamp
i cannot go away from me
and you never cried 
tell me you do not hate me louis i did it for you 
the workmen must have a trunk  do not stop cherie 
it is take the back stairwell 
not yet
still my beautiful child
it was something hurriesand seldom savoured something acute that was quickly lost it was the pale shadow of killing
but how will i ever know louis
claudia you torture yourself
they are ducklings that will grow into swans whereas i must be the duckling forever
you are more beautiful than any of them
you are neither claudia now stop this 
yes should i take her louis among her dolls make a doll of her in turn
come claudia
nonsense all right but something tell me it is going to be the strangest nonsense we have ever seen
they are here i know they are listen for something that does not make a sound
how devilishly clever
no she is frightened she does not know where she is
and no one knows but us
yes and very beautiful
be still
no you would not louis danger hold you to me
love holds you to me and we are in danger not you
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word when he put me in that trance
so you felt it too
let him go he said let him go
you really believe that
do not make me claudia i cannot do it
but if she dies
it is only mortal death
what do you mean
then my luck would have changed
you want death is it death you want
and a beautiful house it is too yours is a good life is not it
why should i be
give it to me
vampires we thrive on blood
i want it
how do you mean start
call him
i cannot do it
you have just done it 
kill me if you will but i cannot do this
i wish i were but if i were what would i want with you
i cannot go through with it i tell you
your perfect your bitter and you are strong
but why do you want me
because you are as strong as i was when i was alive
yes kill me kill me like you promised 
you asked for death i did not promise it 
i want a woman
the crucifix 
forget the crucifix take him
you have fed you were made for this
you have killed louis and enjoyed it
it cannot be
and if i do not
we can live like this off the blood of animals
of course not it is so easy you almost feel sorry for them
read her thoughts
i cannot
i do not know any hell 
as did the one who made me
but you must know something about the meaning of it all you must know where we come from why we
come the new orleans then there's an opera on tonight a real french opera we can dine in splendour
i respect life do not you see for each and every human life i have respect
respect me a little then i am the only life you know
and what if there is no hell or they do not want us there ever think of that
i do not pretend to know
vampires are killers predators who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment
i know let her alone
you finish her  if you feel so much 
in the old world they called it the dark gift louis and i gave it to you
that and more
what are you saying
you need company louis more congenial than mine
i did not want to kill her
do not worry louis you are conscience is clear you left her alive
that is enough cherie stop before the heart stops
you are the devil you are the instrument of satan
shhhh do you want to frighten our little daughter
louis louis i gave you the gift  help me 
are you mad
do not try to speak it is alright
i did not mean to let them do it that santiago he tricked me
that is all past lestat
yes past she should never have been one of us
do not fear me lestat i bring you no harm
you have come back to me louis you have come again to me
you know i love the dark but there's no dark anymore
it is false light lestat it cannot harm you
if you stayed with me louis i could venture out little by little become the old lestat
you remember how i was louis the vampire lestat
yes i remember
so much the better i have got a pocket full of tapes
you followed me here did not you
saw you in the street outside you seemed interesting is this where you live
it is just a room
so shall we begin  what do yo do
i am a vampire
perhaps lucky for both of us
yes but you need not worry about that now things change
we cannot begin this way let me turn on the light
but i thought vampires did not like the light
we love it i only wanted to prepare you
why should i lie 1791 was the year it happened i was twentyfour  younger than you are now
oh that rumour about crosses
you cannot look at them
nonsense my friend i can look on anything i like and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes
the story about stakes through the heart
the same as you would say today bull shit
what about coffins
coffins coffins unfortunately are a necessity
can a vampire feel love
you loved your wife surely
he did it to make you stay with him
how could i not she had to know
and did you lose her did she go
where would she have gone she was a child and beautiful heartbreaking merciless child and i had made her that
he was dead to us we were free that was all that mattered

i cannot bear to see you cry  what is wrong
nothing nothing
we have much to discuss  tomorrow
i could not tell you  you had enough to carry
i am preparing for a ball
we have not visited in three years and we should have privacy
i wish to discuss your brother
he is dead  by god's choice  there is nothing to discuss
he was my blood  and i demand to know what happened to him
why would you ask now  you never asked before
because i have dreamed of him  not as the baby they took away but as a man
you have prayed too much  your mind is weak
yes  dead  two nights ago  the night of my dream
my guards are useless  take her from me
he is your brother
he is nothing now
wear it until you love it  and die in it
how goes that favor i asked of you
i grow closer to my target your majesty
you bring me the heart of the jesuit general and you will have a palace of your own
do not look so shocked phillippe come you are going back to prison
phillippe  why do you call me 
shut up knave
replace the king
i am with you
making the key to the throne
come we have a boat waiting
a body
i see that is a body  but where did you get it
his plight is obvious is not it
you are not my priest aramis  you would not be even if i had one
i have it all worked out
physical resemblance is but one small thing  louis has an arrogance a manner 
those can be adopted 
and people close to him who 
yes and he has a choice
resting he is had a long day aramis 
more wine
you must reconsider this plan phillippe is like a child he 
you can do it
in a year maybe two i could teach him enough to 
three days
three days
you grow fond of him  that is good
do not play god with me aramis i 
but  what is porthos doing
going into the barn naked  or so it appears
but  what is he doing
about to hang himself i should think
he is threatened to do it it is been building up in him for months
we must stop him
come now athos if porthos is determined to end his life then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity
but  but 
the mask is terrifying especially when unexpected  do you notice
all i noticed was that phillippe feels even more like an animal
paris  there is still much to do we will be back soon  be ready
but aramis    phillippe can learn in time but 
hold your goblet with two fingers
we cannot stay here  that traitor d'artagnan knows about this place
you are a fool
perhaps he serves a different king
to the bastille  and death
aramis  the king wishes to see you
still you serve him loyally  though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem
i will need you all  all for one one for all
you  you cannot ask me to betray my king  i have sworn to him
i know  god go with you
you cannot do it
pull them back
everyone back
phillippe get into the boat  into the boat  now
they will know you helped us if we go this way
that does not matter now
be quiet you fat fool  cannot you see i am praying
cannot you see i am praying goddammit
hell may be our destination dear porthos but not this trip
it is also a place of burial
a tomb  we are in a tomb
catacombs  very holy
i expected action  there was no killing no fighting i was useless
i will answer all your questions but first soap water and a razor
not just a baby porthos  i carried the child of the king
the child of the king is the king  louis
no not louis
athos do you understand this  he confuses me 
i carried the king's child  the queen had twins that night and one of them was sent away in secret
but why
we go someplace dangerous
why did not you say so
come on
so was mary magdalene and our lord loved her
did she have tits like that
then let him kill me if all my faith is wrong
we will make our own luck tonight if phillippe holds up
bread and wine in that cupboard
he is right d'artagnan
who does
best not to ask  should not even talk about it
i do not know about you but i plan to wait here
at a ball everyone watches the king
you are right  but it is a trap
so what  i would rather die covered in blood than an old man lying in my own piss
none of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you
michelle she  the king has invited her to come live in the palace
never mind papa it does not matter now  she loved me once  i want to die remembering that
die  what
i have rejoined the army and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of general fromberge
fromberge  at the front  no
it is already done  i have just stopped at mother's grave to say goodbye before coming to tell you
raoul no you cannot do this  no matter how your heart is broken 
you cannot drink with a friend you have not seen in months
i have ordered a drill of the royal guard for midnight and must be clearheaded for it
midnight  mon dieu  driving the youngsters hard eh
they must stay sharp  there was an attempt on the king's life today
another  how many times have you saved his life in this year alone three  four
i heard your playing
if the young woman truly loves raoul 
i fear i know our king  i came to try to bring you hope
raoul is everything to me
i know
oh my friend
raoul is hurrying to the front so i must hurry too
save my son d'artagnan
get out of my way
athos i beg you 
to kill the king
the king killed my son
the cannons killed raoul  the cannons and love  but not the king
an oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed
i cannot athos  dearly as i love you i cannot
i came to see you safely out  check for yourself
what is its antidote
it is something i have done  or did not do
what is that
i did not share beauty with someone who is no longer here for me to share beauty with
i will sit with you  i cannot sleep either
how did you know  
porthos told me
whose rooms are those
your mother's
she will be at the ball
if i could have a blade then i would be please to run with you
just water
phillippe  rest now
what is it d'artagnan  assassins falling from the sky now
i decided it this morning
then you must allow me to stay close to you so that 
a personal nature
in his mind anyway and soon enough in hers  she had written him many letters of love
that is my desire and my desire is what should concern you not the sentiments of some commoner
you dare criticize my father  or lecture me
at least help raoul
silence  i order you
order fromberge to keep him in safety  it is the least you can do to protect your own honor
i will consider it  now leave me
thank you your majesty
it was nothing  a nightmare nothing more  go away i 
you will protect me as you always have d'artagnan
 tired  must lie down
it shall be done your majesty
even the bedchamber passages  let none remain
yes your majesty
 you knew you had a double
he is my brother
my twin  which has kept him alive until now
not once have i ever asked anything for myself  i ask now  forgive this man this prisoner your brother
 the ball continue
i must insist sire
no keeper
thank you keeper
what was the end page
yes yes go on
athos the former musketeer has just fought with several of your guard at the musketeers' gate
 he did  but captain d'artagnan blocked his way
you may go lieutenant
not by you  i will order d'artagnan to do it
out directing the search for the traitors
when he returns watch him  when he leaves again you tell me
the corridor nullifies our number and no one has stomach to fight the captain
shoot them  shoot them
sometimes the poor do grow hungry but why would they riot about it
that food has spoiled  that is why it was not shipped to the army
exactly why it should be given away
what an excellent idea your majesty
you blush  you do not wish to be beautiful to your king
how did i get in  you are new here and will soon learn many secrets what is that
raoul is in love
enough of this our dinner waits
it is lovely  it is just
my dear i have already done it
sire i 
no you may wait behind the screen

it is a tough game  hard to pin that bastard down  keeps on changing the rules
if i tell you then it is no fun
just tell me the fucking riddle
well technically yes but this is only the prototype
yeah who is not
sure  every game's got 'em  i will start with the schematics  i can print these up if you want
level ten  that is where you have got to unlock arcade's heart using the keys you have found
how do you do that
maybe he is not dead
and maybe you have been taking too many drugs
how would you know it was us
security camera  pulled your files before i came down be careful what you say kids  i know where you live
it is the game arcade
you do not like it
neither are we  something's wrong with the game mr difford
why do not we take this into my office
there's something wrong with arcade the game's alive somehow
what the hell does that mean
he is probably outside  you know how he is gets bored
that is her problem
did you play arcade last night
actually no  i was just telling nick here that my tv's busted
i came from the city on the left
guess he took off  you have his keys right
but he was playing the game  i mean you saw him
listen to me  greg never came home i think the game has something to do with it
what the hell are you talking about
we are talking
no in person  now
it is twelvethirty
i am coming over
greg never came home  a few hours is one thing nick but this is different something's happened to him
i am in the middle of it
turn if off
you imagined it
no it did not  it is just a faulty relay or something  it happens
call the others  laurie benz
it is the middle of the night  they are asleep  phone did not wake them
all of them
it is two o'clock in the morning  go home go to sleep  we will figure something out in the morning
no way
if they are sick great  but let's make sure  come on nick
it does not necessarily mean she is
let's go around back
we cannot
my house  i want to try something
but then it hits the relay stations
right  and then communication satellites and then anywhere
it is already out
the police then
i do not know
and beat it at it is own game
you realize that in order to do that we would actually have to play the game
i was afraid you would say that
drives 'em crazy every time
no i am not
what are you going to do
get that helmet  if we are going to play arcade i want every advantage possible
i cannot believe you made it
yeah  the inferno
a way to hook this helmet into the game i am sure there are interfaces
put in a quarter
it can turn itself on alex  it does not need a quarter
yes it does  do not you see  we have to play by the rules  that is what it wants
yes i am
no  if you are smart you run like hell
i already have a boyfriend nick
i know  it sucks
we are actually inside are not we
one  in case
do not even say it
yeah well i figure these are unusual circumstances
that is what i was hoping you would say
got it
you have got the schematics check
right then
yeah that is what worries me
what  there's nothing here
look around
we do not have a choice
one of them anyway  did you see it  the screamer
i do not want to talk about it
there never is
never been on a snowboard
i just thought of something  if we came back from the game  what if arcade did too
so tell me you are okay then
i am okay
good   cause i would freak if you were not
and then keep on driving
sure  never come back  disappear forever
hold my keys then
well it is a long story
then we will go home
that way
in this world wrong is right

oh you could do nothing  i can save you much pain
leave her alone i tell you
i do not joke in my proposal
no  it is on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind
but does it have to be in a cemetery
shirley i wrote for years without selling a single word
that is life  my kisses are alive
who's to say my monsters are not alive
it frightens me
silly there's nothing in there to be afraid of
thenthen that is that music
that is what i want to find out we have to get help
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night
something's making that music
i am not sure i care to find out what it is
all right  do not worry i will be right beside you
what help will that do if something in there is not dead
not dead  in a cemetery
i cannot imagine anything dead playing that music
i am not sure
what do you mean
you have got a right to be we are trapped by a bunch of fiends
those creatures
do not let them hear you
what can we do
i do not know  i just do not know but do not give up we are not finished yet
i am afraid i will faint
whatever you do do not do that
be careful
i amit is our only chance
nothing is worth your life
hold on just a little longer shirley
yes i feel it in my bones
you are talking nonsense
oh no i am not  these heathens probably have an open grave for us
they would not dare put us in the same grave bor would theyb
i should hope not  i hate you
that sudden
all right  put it on heavy
my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this  at least ihe isi got brains
ihimi  i will bet he sleeps with all the lights on
maybe so
there's nothing to forgive it was all a dream
you love me then
of course i do
a situation easily remedied
tie them that they may watch
a symbol master
what kind of symbol
el dia de los muertosa celebration in her country
her dance has pleased me
as i said a worshipper of snakes and of smoke and flames
oh yes a religion of sorts
it would seem so master
now i will talkto the wolf manand the mummy
as you wish master
at the first sight of the morning sungs rays we must be gone
i suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon
it would seem so master
ahh but i declare there is still time for isomeithing
the moon is almost gone
ahh there is yet time
at the first sight of the morning's rays' light
i know the laws of the night i state there is still time for yet another
i would have time for my own pleasures
then see that it does not happen again in the penalty of everlasting despair  now are there others
there are others
well then let us proceed
i will decide the conclusion
you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session
then cancel my order
the bmoonb is almost bgoneb
there is yet time  do not you want your own pleasure
oh if there is only time
hahh there is always time all in good timethere is balwaysb time  you shall have your pleasure  bthatb i idecreei
for what
your pleasures of course
you mean
you may take her now
is there time
you better hope there is
thank you master  thank you
yes master
live ones where only the dead should be
yes master and we caught them him and me
you know better than that
we do not know of anything master
then why do you shake so
it is not often an emperor like iyoui calls on creatures like us
well rest easy i am not angry with either of you
ahh good  then i will see them  dismiss the rest
yes sir master
i am so frightened
aahhhhnnnaaahahnn aaaaaahhhhooowwwoooooooooooooooooooooo
when i was alive they were the things nightmares were made of
ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn
without the snake of course
certainly sir i will get my notes and come right over
did you forget our appointment cornelius
oh no sir i was just assembling my notes
you know dr maximus our commissioner for animal affairs
certainly sir it is a pleasure to see you again
i apologize
that is correct and you will both stand trial for heresy
do you have any weapons
the best but we will not need them
just the same i want one
it is a long detour to dead lake what would we find
sorry taylor the terrain around that lake is poisonous there is no fresh water no vegetation nothing
i know  nevertheless i thank you for saving us you will be in trouble for going there
it empties into a sea some miles from here that is where the cave is
right now if you like
taylor you are not in command here put down that gun
shut up
no you saved me from this fanatic maybe i can pay you back
what are you doing there
reconstructing a life care to have a look
good luck then
that is so special about him
watch  hello bright eyes how is our throat today
remembers what
the blood transfusion
zira come on you know they cannot   oh oh here comes number one
dear you are a scientist do not you believe your own eyes
where did you learn to do this
oh cornelius be quiet
and they fell out of the sky with you
and even if it were not why fly where would it get you
no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone i have been there i have seen it
i do not and i am not going to try
but what about your theory the existence of someone like taylor might prove it
zira are you trying to get my head cut off
do not be foolish if it is true they will have to accept it
no they will not 
it is probably wrong 
you did not think so then
that was before dr zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy
because if he is a missing link it means the sacred scrolls are not worth their parchment
well maybe they are not
no thank you' i will not get into that battle
oh cornelius show some strength
there was one bad moment  some hunters stopped us
right  let's put the water and provisions in the wagon
good question  landon  check your communications kit
any sign of dangerous ionization
that way
any particular reason
none at all
let's find them all
blessed are the vegetarians
i do not know this beast lost a lot of blood
what do you mean made it i am an animal psychologist that is all we do not have any authority
you do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment
that is because dr zaius realizes our work has value
they are still dirty and their bite is septic look at that 
well dr zira this is a man is he not
come to the point dr honorius
proceed but do not turn this hearing into a farce
very well i suggest we go and look at them
sustained  your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature
i admit i know nothing of your culture
of course he does not know our culture  because he cannot think  tell us why all apes are created equal
some apes it seems are more equal than others
good morning julius how is our patient today
no change the minute you open the door he goes into his act
do not be silly he is perfectly tame
see he keeps pretending he can talk
well you know what they say human see human do
those fools and their torches do you have any ointment
i will see
he is vicious doctor besides it is against the rules
do as i say
what signal
to earth that we have landed
forget it abandon ship
sorry  i was thinking of stewart what d'you suppose happened
air leak died in her sleep
you do not seem very cut up about it
it is a little late for a wake she is been dead nearly a year
then we have been away from earth for eighteen months
by our time  you have turned gray
because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for  they are dust
prove it if we cannot get back it is still just a theory
it is a fact landon buy it you will sleep better
what would you learn i have told you where you are and when you are
do not bother
try telling them our names
zira does not want your female
i want her
if you insist but i am not taking any orders 
fine just let her out
i am for that
in my world  before i left it  only youngsters of your age wore un scraped hair
always giving orders just like every other adult
relax you will see it all later
what is it
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner
yes i can do that
i will start by following the shoreline  and my nose
that is the boy keep 'em flying
he would not leave her
all right  get inhurry  put this on
keep moving we cannot turn back now
the hunt club
to scare off humans
a man dr maximus
why special
we are  conducting a new experiment
my own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation
my name is taylor
this hearing is absurd let me tell my story
bailiff make the animal be quiet
dr zira silence that man
bailiff stop this outburst gag that monstrosity
mind your tongue madame
did we create his mind too not only can this man speak he can write he can reason
is it a joke to seek the truth about this man
with one of them
identify him then speak to him
you lied where is your tribe
my tribe as you call it lives on another planet in a distant solar system
a fort unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent  where were you nurtured
i take it you do not believe the prosecutor's charge  that i am a monster created by dr zira
certainly not	you are a mutant
that is exactly what zira and cornelius claim you are talking heresy doctor
of course
all right suppose i am a mutant why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic
because you are not unique there was the one you call landon 
then you admit 
if you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity
i am not protecting anybody that hearing was a farce what have i done
do not be a fool you are outnumbered and outgunned
all right let's see if you are willing to put that statement to a test
when were the sacred scrolls written
twelve hundred years ago
okayup to the cave
cease fire withdraw
of course you could return with us our society might find a place for you and your mate
sure	in a cage
where else but in a cage does man belong
no thanks i will take freedom
the forbidden zone was once a paradise your breed made a desert of it ages ago
listen listen  i can speak 
my  name  is not  bright eyes it is taylor
there can you believe it i looks like he is talking
dr zaius i could have sworn he was answering you
a hearing
which one
second from the left
no i swear  i never saw this man before
you did this to him you have removed his frontal lobes
maybe not
you want her that much
you threw us together remember and you guessed right men like apes get despondent without a mate
she is not sick at all  she is pregnant
taylor please 
except that he is also the chief defender of the faith
he has a point on my planet children often play with ape dolls
taylor you cannot
why not
it is humiliating
was not i humiliated by all of you did not you lead me around on a leash
we cannot
it is better than going to prison for heresy
all right but  you are so damned ugly
god bless you
of course he saw you moving yours
but perhaps he understood 
yes sir
i do not state it sir the prisoner does
do you believe him
like you i find it difficult
where are they now
he does not know
mr president i believe the prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with bright eyes
sirs our theories have a bearing on his identity
but there's the doll sir
in a few minutes there will be no doll there cannot be  i am sorry
my name's larry mitchell i live in vancouver
i am afraid there's nothing i can do about it mr mitchell
how far does this train go
vancouver bc
i am going to vancouver mr mitchell
perhaps i do not take it so lightly
where are you staying in vancouver royal it is pretty crowded you know
is it i expected to go to the vancouver royal should i have a reservation
i will make one for you  i live there
i really do not know
you do not know
very nice mitchell turns
no thanks
thank you
suppose i had not known that immigration inspector had not put in a good word for you
i am supposing
not tonight
that is the matter
i am not in the mood for dining and dancing
we have some nice places around vancouver
i am sure you have
nobody gets invited to clark brandongs parties they just go
i am trying very hard to be polite about it
would you mind
okay you win
if you change your mind about the cocktail party or anything else give me a buzz
if i change my mind
how do you do
why certainly baby
how careful should i be
just drunk enough
next time you try that mr mitchell  do not i am warning you
how soon can i get a plane to seattle
i am afraid there's nothing more tonight miss unless you charter a plane
how long would that take
possibly miss
i am miss mayfield is mr  campbell here
i am carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks how much of a deposit would you like
no please
sit down then we often have a double up here
i see
disgusting are not they if you really want a martini i know where you can get one
i see
it might be worth a martini to you
i do not need it that badly i do not enjoy crashing other people's parties
it is openhouse no crashing involved anybody in the hotel's welcome
what did you say his name was
no not very well and i like his friends even less but  if you really want a good dry martini
as i said before
sure but i would hate like the dickens to be held to everything i have said before would not you
i never pay for anything they just keep me here to amuse the guests
and do you amuse the guests
no  are you really going to drink that stuff
you are drinking it
i can be talked out of it as a matter of fact i would like a dry martini myself
would it make you anymore amusing
whatever you say
i did not say anything
thanks for the fresh air that felt good
you are sure mr brandon will not mind
he does not even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor
much too late
do not take it so big it is not a tragedy
sure but somebody always does
i do not
how did you meet him
on a train he said he lived here and he offered to make a reservation for me
nice of him
he knew the immigration officer he eased himself in
he was a great boy for that what else
that is all there is
i would rather wait until it does matter
there was not any plane
it is always a mistake to run away always
no thanks
he could hardly help suspecting you
that is putting it mildly
quarter after one why
there's a lot of night left to live through
let's not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us
certainly not to me
just who are you anyway
at this time of night it is not as bad as it looks
dance here
why not
they know you hereknow your name
i did not notice him
we walked right passed him he is following us
killaine's not that sort of guy he said nohe meant no
then he is got to be a detective
could not be
then he is 
absolutely sure
we will find out
you do not know who he is
he is not a cop a cop would not have kneed me
he was following usbut he is not a policeman
anything i can do about it
take me homeand forget you ever saw me that is a silly remark is not it
try not talking
nothing matters
no use waiting then
so have i
from you i like it
i am in the hudson bay company's store  that man last nightthe one that followed me
i do not think that is on the market anymore  i would like something much closer to the water
there's another manright outside the booth here  i never saw him before
no percentage in that
they are going to arrest me
i know  killaine has a warrant
i have my own warrant  stop a minute please
how bad is it  bad enough for 
yes  i have never been very far from it for a long time  will you do something for me
how bad is the other thing  the secret
it is the frame on the picture but not if you say so
you would not like it  i have been there
my father died in jail and he was twice the man i am
i can still see the shoreline the moon is rising
there would be a moon tonight
wonder what
if you are doing all this just for me
that and the fun of it
i thought you had to be back to the hotel  to leave mymy note
that is right
including killaine
including killainei still cannot think of you that way
if it was an accident you could have told the truth
so could you  but our records were a little against us
what your father did does not condemn you
he will come backthey always come back when you give them money
not this one  and not mitchell
i am still on course to victoria nobody saw you get on board nobody seen you since
and that nasty man that followed us last night  you did not kill him
you think magruder wants to hang beside me
do you think i was faking
if i didi do notnow
i would like a dry martini very dry please
sorry miss beer and ale only canadian law
beer  well all right
beer or ale miss
ale i do not mind
right miss
i do not know her or particularly want to
i will have to know a little more than that
i am sorry that is all there is
you did not ask a question you made a speech
that is an evasion and you know it
it is
there's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger
regimental seaforth highlanders
i am sorry
stop saying you are sorry i want information not regrets
would you be satisfied if i said i shot him
a graduation present
why do not you arrest me and be done with it
i probably shallafter i have tortured you a little more
deep blue i would call it greyblue
you must come from pretty far south
true i was a bit irritable last night i apologize
you were a galahad compared to some cops i have known
you have had dealings with the police before
who has notone way or another
but not in the investigation of a major crime i hope
is it a crime
i would like to believe that it is not too easy
the police always do do not they
you have has an experience that you do not want to talk about an unhappy marriage for example
we try to be decent
nobody can help me you least of all
if i understand what you meant by that
you understand perfectly
then there is not much i can do is there
there is not anything you can do
i do not want to talk
i have come here to arrest you for murder
i might be able to save you  if i knew enough
you would not even try  there must be some copper in you or you would not be an inspector
there must be but when i am with you i cannot find it
he looks at the girl looks into her eyes
what does he see
that is my hard lucki am man enough to tell you about itand not be sorry
what do your friends call you the ones that know you welland like you very much
they call me jeff
jeff  shall we go now jeff and get it over with
so mitchell had handled it afterwards brandon picked it up  there's no indication you handled it
i always wear gloves when i shoot people  a bad jokebut better than tears
time's up  i am off the case 
they will only find someone else who will not be so kind
that is something i cannot spare you  but i will not do it myself
because you think your in love with me
to do what
i cannot answer that
what will they do to you
that is they are business  can i drop you somewhere
but even if you were in love with me
goodbye betty
we know everything
no jeff  you do not  he is not a murderer i tell you  hes not a murderer
i hope he can prove it  come on you do not want to get pneumonia
i understand betty  i understand perfectly
morning any calls
mr reed would like you to call him
all right get him
and there's a mr goble to see you says his business is personal
who's goble
i am not interested in blind dates
you asked for it
i am still asking what do you want
i am not sure i want anything from you you might want something from me
name it
mayfield oh that girl you were with last night you have not hired me yet mr brandon
if i call the police your price will go down to a minus sign
bluff you have waited too long
for five hundred what do i get
i go home and paint the kitchen
for two hundred
i stick around and wait for the five hundred
you mentioned information
sorry another client paid for that you can hire me not to use it
a thousand
got it on you
got the information on you
get it in half an hour
why not here
i do not like your perfume in my office make it somewhere else if you do not like charlie's
charlie's suits me fine i do not scare
in the same elevator it is a public conveyance
leave that one lay
they still hang women in canada i have heard
that comedian
that is a buzzer
so you are not a cop
me a cop what made you think that mr brandon
who told you my name
i have got good ears
the new ones are fine the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble
you are not english
how is life treating you
the usual grind
round of golf saturday
if i can get off
hardly who's the girl
somebody mitchell picked up on the train i do not even know her name
she does not look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train
yes i have seen it before
i rather thought so and before that had you ever seen the gun
near his right hand about a foot away perhaps more good heavens one does not use a tape measure
we do when we get the chance
no thanks i had some how would you like to take a walk for say half and hour
i do not
wellgood night
if it does not take too long  drink
thanks  i do not mind
i never notice the view after the first week
sure  let's discuss betty mayfield  how long since you saw her
a couple of hours
i have a warrant for her arrest
that must hurt
you would be breaking the law
does not answer the question
the only answer i have for you
you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her  what toughened you up
it could have been an accident
that could be told
not if she knew she would not be believed
mitchell was killed down here  how could clarendon get in to do it  or margo for that matter
how could mitchell  after that act he put on up here is it likely she would let him in
she did not have to  he could have climbed down from here
you do not buy it  okay  so i still want betty mayfield  where is she
no idea
where would she go anyway  do not tell me you have not got her covered
i am afraid they do  far too often so long
wait a minute  i will go with you
now and then  mostly just for the fun of it
i tried it once  i lost my shirt
i buy my shirts by the dozen fortunately
where did it all come from  or is that a permissible question
oh  that was just one of those idle questions  one does not expect an answer
the liquors lovely the rest of the party you can have
lay off cannot you
did i do something wrong
i would not know just do it somewhere else there is such a thing as good manners
how would you know brandon
want to walk out or get thrown out
you do not throw guests out brandon
do not bet on it i am eccentric
mr mitchell
a little something on account perhaps
rather more than a little something mr mitchell
i am afraid this is all for the moment
nothing to discuss tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter be grateful for small mercies
i see out friend larry mitchell is with us again
oh shut up  you have not even got your spats on
i do not think you locked your door
what do you want
and now that he is safe from all other women you can go on loving him
you nasty sardonic
sardonic if you will my dear bust nasty you lied about the gun
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun you lied it was obvious
he saw my face too
so he didbut he has not told you what he saw i have
they will arrest that girl everything points to her
convenient is not it
i am sorry inspector i do not know much about
recently then
no not recently i am sure of that
thank you
thank you it is rather late and i am not young anymore good night
you are the waterfront specialist find out about it  i have got a murder to investigate
you have two murders to investigate this mangs head was beaten in and there's nothing in his pockets
drunkrolling job  they hit him too hard
i have got a year  or a second i am not sure which
you told me when we would identified this fellow
if you would seen the blood on his headand some body had to carry him out to sea
i understand  pity to mess up a nice clean boat
i got through to greer his partner in the detective business  greer will not give out
would you
how important would it have to be it is only murder inspector
men like you do not need orders
the joint's not open mac  who's brandon
go live in a tent
it will be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet
talk english  how do i know you are you
one of those nice long manila envelopessealed  not too fat not too thin
what do i get for it
you get it is brother
sounds like a fair swap  let's take a look
open it and count it
when you sign for it you count it  it is your dough
so it seems sergeant
they tell me he will be a great loss to the liquor trade this mayfield girl
i have met her
correct inspector a womangs gun us 125 caliber ammunition in it it was on a table in there
unless the gun was slanted up
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer
right a clean deduction from observed facts they have got to be simple once in a while inspector
i have always looked forward to it all right let's get him out of here and tidy up
i guess i am just ballast around here
somebody did it twice last night in the dark
maybe we have been pretty dumb
there was not any motivelet's try out the act
i think so
where is the shell
should be over there
you can find out
do i know that she is out of the room  likely to be out of it for some time
you can find out the first part the second part you have to take a chance on
pretty big chance huh
you have got a dead man on your hands like this
well  what about it
did we ever really think it was suicide
i never wear a hat  oh so i am i forgot  i guess i am terribly sorry again mrs west
oh nothing
are you always this witty
warm water no doubt
not quiet yet
anybody could commit suicide if he felt low enough i have felt it myself
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt
how did you know  clarendon  you cops never tell anybody anything do you
other people always know so much more than we knowso much more than they are willing to tell us
it was clarendon  he knew i had the gun in my bag
of course not  thanks for telling me  i have not seen mr clarendon
i am a fool
that depends upon your motive you were in love with mitchell were not you
did you ever have a serious operation
mortar shells are not funny either
it does  may i go now 
i will investigate mr clarendongs financial position
i do not understand
perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems
now you are being beastly
four different people inspector three men and a women  i have made slides for two  they handled both envelopes
how about magruder
he checks too
that leaves two strangers
so far
try betty mayfield  the mitchell case
mayfield  she fit into this
she might
the card says so does not it
brandon handled the money envelope
how do you do sir
she is a suspect naturally  but not the only one
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment
aye  you have a point there
a little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either
it will not look pretty good on your record killaine  where is the girl now
i do not know sir
well find out  who's covering her
nobody's covering her i detached the officer assigned to that duty
we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfield's toilet articles  washington ought to teletype us within a few hours
and in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases does what she pleases
yes sir
but you still think she is innocent
i do
what are my orders sir
you think i am wrong about this bit of a girl  go out and prove it against me
with your charm how could i help it have a nice trip
her name's mayfield betty mayfield
why should i mind
you should not you washed me up very thoroughly
as thoroughly as i could it was not easy but you are helping me
margo darling you washed me up remember we are just friends you wanted it that way
she is very beautiful she is much younger than i am and she is rich i hope
rich i have not the faintest idea why
you ought to know why
you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police
i have a rough idea
you would go to jail for a long term
correct i could not even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me
you do not have to make a pose of it
it is the only pose i have left i am sunk broke i do not even have my hotel bill
i seem to recognize this routine first the kiss then the touch  oh that is the use you are you
that is not very kind
kind or not kind that is the difference it always ends up the same way
what does it look like
how long have you had it
years why
i did not mean it that way  i am sorry
oh forget it clark brandongs throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening take me
of course
how about your new friend
i told you she is just
a girl you meet on the train excuse my bringing it up again  be back in an hour right
it is quite unimportant mr mitchell after all you got what you wanted
be nasty
i have no intension of being nasty mr mitchell
in that case there's someone here i would like to introduce to you over there
i say yes
unsophisticated  if i knew about this babe
six others us issue jungle boots they came in from the north then followed the guerrillas
i cannot believe jim hopper walked into an ambush
i do not believe he did sir i could not find a single track just does not make sense
what about the rest of hopper's men
something in the trees
no way old buddy
you never did know when to quit
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya
who's our backup on this
they are getting better equipped every day
probably another rebel patrol they operate in here all the time
why us
the wound all fused cauterized what the hell did this
expendable assets dillon seems langley is never around when you need them
i can accept that it comes with the job
bullshit you are just like the rest of us
no more games
we are going to need everyone
what are you talking about we will be out of here in ten minutes
we are not going
that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles at most we are almost home but the chopper will not wait
now what dutch you going to send your mystery guest an invitation
this is not your style dillon
right behind you
what sergeant
 right i got a score to settle for the bro
we both got scores to settle
i saw it
i will take him
the best friend i ever had
it is been a long time general
that is the problem apparently they strayed off course  we are certain they have been captured by the guerrillas
that is that general
someone else will be going in with you
there's something else major
same business guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper followed by men with american equipment
i think it is hawkins
where the hell is his body
there's no sign of it
he knows our defenses
why did not he try to kill one of us last night
roger do you mind if we talk a little business
please please that is what we are here for  be careful that hurt
what are you saying
let's hear him  what have we got to lose  that is your name
of the silvery moon
of the silvery mooooon
i want to croon
he wants to croon he wants to croon

what you were saying  keep talking
what was i saying
well it is very easy  you simply raise more money than you really need

you have done it yourself only you did it on a very small scale
what did i do
you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play
so what  what did it get me  i am wearing a cardboard belt
exactly  and how long did it run
one night
but what if the play was a hit

mrs virginia resnick  she also owns 50% of the profits
mrs alma wentworth  she owns 100% of the profits

tybalt the kinsman of old capulet hath sent a letter to his father's house
a challenge on my life
romeo will answer it
any man that can write may answer a letter
nay he will answer the letter's master how he dares being dared
thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in verona
by my head here come the capulets
by my heel i care not

but new struck cuz
ay me sad hours seem long was that my father that went hence so fast
it was what sadness lengthens romeo's hours
not having that which having makes them short
in love
out of her favour where i am in love
alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
good heart at what
at thy good heart's oppression
farewell my cuz
soft i will go along an if you leave me so you do me wrong
in sadness cousin i do love a woman
i aim would so near when i supposed you loved
a right good marksman and she is fair i love
a right fair mark fair cuz is soonest hit

be ruled by me forget to think of her
teach me how i should forget to think
by giving liberty unto thine eyes examine other beauties why romeo art thou mad
but 'tis no wit to go
art thou hurt
uncle this is that villain romeo a montague our foe
young romeo is it
'tis he
he shall be endured
uncle 'tis a shame
go to what goodman boy i say he shall go to make a mutiny among my guests
the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law then be not poor but break it and take this
my poverty but not my will consents
i pay thy poverty and not thy will
drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
here is my gold worse poison to mengs souls than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell
my leisure serves me pensive daughter now we must entreat the time alone
be not so long to speak i long to die
benedicite what early tounge so sweet saludeth me
god pardon sin was thou with rosaline
rosaline my ghostly father no i have forgot that name and that name's woe
that is my good son but where hast thou been
for doting not for loving pupil mine
wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
romeo come forth
here comes your father tell him so yourself
farewell god knows when we shall meet again

and from my soul too else beshrew them both
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
well then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake
then move not while my prayer's effect i take thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged
then have my lips the sin that they have took
sin from my lips o trespass sweetly urged give me my sin again
you kiss by the book
she speaks o speak again bright angel
neither fair maid if either thee dislike
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it
a thousand times good night exit above
by the hour of nine
i will not fail 'tis twenty year till then
i must be gone and live or stay and die
more light and light more dark and dark our woes
verona's summer hath not such a flower
nay he is a flower in faith a very flower
speak briefly can you like of paris' love
go girl seek happy nights to happy days
you are a lover borrow cupid's wings and soar with them above a common bound
under love's heavy burden do i sink
too great oppression for a tender thing
is love a tender thing it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down
i dream would a dream tonight
and so did i
well what was yours
that dreamers often lie
in bed asleep while they do dream things true
ay so i fear the more is my unrest
signior romeo bon jour there's a french salutation to your french slop you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night
good morrow to you both what counterfeit did i give you
the slip son the slip can you not conceive
pardon good mercutio my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
that is as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams
meaning to court'sy
thou hast most kindly hit it
a most courteous exposition
nay i am the very pink of courtesy
pink for flower
farewell ancient lady farewell
courage man the hurt can not be much
a plague o' both your houses
no mercutio
oh and but one word with one of us couple it with something make it a word and aa blow
you shall find me apt enough to that sir and you will give me occasion
could you not take some occasion without giving
mercutio thou art consortest with romeo
what wouldst thou have with me
good king of cat's nothing but one of your nine lives

my guess too
sir i ai not feeling so chipper on account of wade
who's wade

keep trying
it is worth it
to each his own
a halftrack anything

you are kidding yourself
you never know
now you are the one kidding yourself  hell of  a mission
yup hell of a mission
it does not take this
is it getting worse
no  it comes and goes  it stops when i look at it
how about i go right sir
how about you take your position
how about you shut up and take your position
about to pour his sulfa  sees the wound  stops  knows it is fatal
more morphine hurry up come on come on
hesitates  then drops his sulfa fumbles in his pack  finds the morphine
snatches the morphine from sarge quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot  he is done this before
let's just find someplace
bits and pieces
oh yeah
i think you are right keith
you want me to take over
just what i want to do
i know
you are welcome john
yes sir

out of the mouth of babes
yes sir

stay at it until you get fire control  keep 'em down wait for the navy
no i am not kaback is honest  or what about faulkner  or that little guy with the glasses
trust me you are the best
but sir

where are you planning on putting private ryan sir
yeah how so
i am listening sir
well i for one like cheese
stands on the edge of the woods almost in a trance
upham are you sure you have never been in combat
sure what do you want to know
reiben there's a fairly good chance you are not going to die at all
easy for you to say sir  fucking james ryan i would like to wring his fucking neck
you have orders too
we cannot leave it here
i thought you said we had an hour sir
well now i am saying we are moving out  get off your ass
no sir
that is a mystery to me
looks like tea time maybe they are brits
on the bridge  we are coming in
what if our guys open up sir
you are only allowed to shoot at germans that is one of the rules
have it your way captain
see to it
here they come
opens up with the machine gun
get back to your positions
i coach the baseball team too
that is not where i am  miller no where are you
here they come
fires a burst  germans drops
fires a burst  more germans drop
knows what that means  he hears the rumble of the tanks
sir if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up our guys are going to be sitting ducks
this bridge cannot be held  the germans have two companies less than three miles from here  they have tanks
yeah yeah  i want you right next to me no matter where i go you understand
alright come with me
no private i want you to stay here keep your head down do not do anything brave or stupid
i will not need to sir it is already here behind the barricade so
yes sir
struggling with a pair of germans
looks at miller sees him growing weak starting to sway  he gently tries to move miller aside
races through the debris  trailed by bullets
upham and jackson what were they like
upham  good kid smart he was writing a book
sarge  he was the best friend i ever had  lemme tell you about sarge
no i just happen to take the captaings advice and look at the bright side of things
you want unpleasant  just wait i can do much better than this
look at upham you do not hear him complaining
we all have he is got nine lives or he is bulletproof or some damn thing
for you to blow up yeah yeah we heard that
fertilizer captain i think we are in a cranberry bog
out of the frying pan into the fucking latrine
i care  do not you know what caengs famous for sarge
what are we likely to run into
captain he is fast
hey i got a mother  jackson you got a mother
get lost
we know
somebody must know where he is from what he did for a living
he is fast captain i saw him
goddamn itgoddamn itgoddamn it
freaked out  trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter  cannot
what about you captain
it is easy it runs in my family take my grandfather for example
who knows  it worked
how is that
there's nothing that says i have to work with him  if somerset wants out goodbye  give it to me
thank you
go start picking up the pieces  we will shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner
he would not just turn himself in  it does not make any sense
you are wound too tight mills  let it go
ease back mills
i am in
there are seven deadly sins  gluttony wrath greed
so what  this victim
 envy sloth pride and lust  seven
this cannot be my last duty here  it will go on and on
everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible  also this should not be his first assignment
no i have not heard
there was a second
i thought you might want to be filled in
i am sure everyone's doing their best
i will get a job maybe on a farm  i will work on the house
cannot you feel it yet  cannot you feel that feeling   you are not going to be a cop anymore
what are you talking about
you know
i have no understanding of this place anymore
it is always been like this
he is not finished
i can breathe withour pain now so i guess i feel great
it would be too hard
i read about it in the paper
i will see you
what  what
where was the prostitute  where was she
who tied her down  you or him
turn around  hands on your head
what the hell's going on
who are you  what are you doing out here
i am i am just delivering a package
put it down  put it on the ground
i mean at this point what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself
it is not too far away now
david please
i visited your home this morning after you left
her pretty head
you will see
not me  i am not special  i am not exceptional  this is though  what i am doing
in two months no one's going to even remember this happened
murderers like you
you should be thanking me
and why is that
and i remember breaking your nose  you are only alive because i did not kill you
sit back
it is close
what the fuck is going on here
shut up
what the fuck is going on
i want you to know i wish i could have lived like you do
i meant to ask you something mills when we spoke on the phone  i cannot help wondering why here
i i do not follow
all this effort you have made to get transferred it is the first question that pops into my head
maybe i am not understanding the question
not here
i realize that
well over the next seven days do me the favor of remembering it
for now
no one yet
is there any blood in it
i do not know  feel free to look for yourself okay
guessing at this point is useless
okay sure  it is just that with my old partner you know
i just do not think we should have that sort of relationship  we would start quarreling over insignificant things
have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink  near the food
but why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing  it must have been intentional
this is a premeditated puzzle and it is only the beginning
whoa whoa what
can we talk about this in private
detective mills here  honey i asked you not to call me here i will call you back  what  why
how is that
what about sports
what about them
i read  remember reading
i just have to say i cannot respect any man who's never seen green acres
i vaguely recall a large angry man and someone called norton
i am certain  he was the biggest defense lawyer around  infamous actually
look i appreciate being able to talk this out but uh
this is just to satisfy my curiosity  i am still leaving town saturday
we put her in a safe house
did you read them
right  but there pride comes first not gluttony  the sins are in a different order
attrition  when you regret your sins but not because you love god
like because someone's holding a gun on you
none  which i do not understand  he had to get back out
i know
even if they did those photos were taken before forensics
a switchblade
we are screwed  he is fucking with us
just wait
it does not fit  he does not want us to help him stop
i wish i still thought like you
then you tell me what you think we are doing
does not seem like our man does it
you tell me  i am new in town
yes  they were there so it must be
we will tag along
satisfy our curiosity
call an ambulance
listen to me  he is all about playing games
no kidding  no fucking kidding
he will string us along all the way if we are not careful
they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well
sorry about that i just
oh it is alright
who pays the rent on time
this is the job  it is not an easter egg hunt
oh blah blah blah  the guy's insane
it is a fine line between insane and inspired
yes we do  here
well he is been right so far has not he
just because the bastard has a library card it does not make him einstein
i do not know like fifty
let's go
what  assessing fines
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable communism to violent crime
how is this legal
legal illegal  these terms do not apply i do not applaud it
yeah well at least we are out of the office  we have got pizza
how do you know all about this
i do not  neither do you
we are focusing
i know i know focusing on one little thing
the divine comedy  a history of catholicism  a book called murderers and madmen
it is not what you think it is
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism
that is
the writings of saint thomas aqu aquin
saint thomas aquinas  he wrote about the seven deadly sins
that is what it says  jonathan doe
this is stupid  it would be just too easy
we will take a look at him  talk to him
you do the talking  put that old silver tongue of yours to work
who told you about my silver tongue  you been talking to my wife
i am fine
what happened
it was him
you cannot go in there
we need a warrant
we have probable cause now
what the fuck is wrong with you
think about how we got here
no point in arguing anymore
we had him
i am trying alright  just tell me what we have got
these murders are his masterwork  his sermon to all of us  to all us sinners
if we get him i will be happy enough
no  face it now  stop thinking it is good guys against bad guys
how can you say that  especially after today
where is the victory
you follow the law and do the best you can it is all there
what the fuck is wrong with you  what burnt you out
call for help and you will live  but you will be disfigured  or put yourself out of your misery
no actually i was not sure at all
big surprise
when do we get to question him
you and i are probably for the first time ever in total agreement  he would not just stop
well what the fuck man
i will
well i have to tell you  i think i have fallen in love with you
give me a break
what are you talking about  what happened
what did you say
i cannot let you do this

without doubt he is completing it at this very moment
what have i done mr fennyman
the theatres are all closed by the plague
oh that
by order of the master of the revels
nothing strangely enough  it all turns out well
oh it is coming it is coming
very well
but nothing is happening

god be praised  locked
as soon as i have found my muse
she is always aphrodite
aphrodite baggot who does it behind the dog and trumpet
henslowe you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate
noit is comedy they want will comedy like romeo and ethel
who wrote that
nobody you are writing it for me i gave you three pounds a month since
half what you owed me i am still due for one gentleman of verona
fifty pounds what for
burbage offers me a partnership in the chamberlaings men for fifty pounds my hired player days are over
cut out my heart throw my liver to the dogs
no then
to my weekly confession
to the palace at whitehall
is it about a pirate's daughter
rosaline you mean ethel
well i to my work you to yours when can i see pages
we are about to embark on a great voyage
it is customary to make a little speech on the first day it does no harm and authors like it
you want to know what parts you are to receive all will be settled as we go
what who
no it will turn out well
how will it
i do not know it is a mystery
what do we do now
the show must  you know
go on
juliet does not come on for twenty pages it will be all right
how will it
i do not know it is a mystery
wonderful wonderful
burbage says you have a play
i have and chinks to show for it
i hear you have a new play for the curtain
not newmy doctor faustus
good title
and yours
romeo and ethel the pirate's daughter  yes i know
what is the story
well there's a pirate  in truth i have not written a word
romeo isitalian always in and out of love
yes that is good until he meets
the daughter of his enemy
the daughter of his enemy
his best friend is killed in a duel by ethel's brother or something his name is mercutio
mercutiogood name
i thought your play was for burbage
this is a different one
a different one you have not written
is the day so young
ay me sad hours seem long was that my father that went hence so fast
it was what sadness lengthens romeo's hours
not having that which having makes them short
out of her favour where i am in love
lady viola is pious my lord
piety is for sunday and two hours at prayer is not piety it is self importance
it would be better that you return tomorrow my lord
be patient my lord she is dressing
will you ask her majesty to be patient
i will
thank you let go there's a good nurse
i liked the dog for laughs
but at the playhouse nurse
be still
i am not so wellborn
wellmonied is the same as wellborn and wellmarried is more so lord wessex was looking at you tonight
verona again
from tomorrow away in the country for three weeks is master shakespeare not handsome
he looks well enough for a mountebank
oh nurse he would give thomas kent the life of viola de lesseps's dreaming
my lady this play will end badly i will tell
stand up straight girl
your majesty
what do you love so much
your majesty
they are not acted for you they are acted for me
above lord wessex
why lord wessex lost your wife so soon
indeed i am a bride short how is this to end
give it to master kent he will see it rightfully home wessex gives his purse to viola
go ask his nameif he be married my grave is like to be my wedding bed
i have lost my gift
you left it in my bed come to look for it again
are you to be my muse rosaline
burbage has my keeping but you have my heart
but your voice  have they dropped
no no a touch of cold only we suspect he is lying but will has turned away
master henslowe you have your actors
luck be with you sam  sam
it is not my fault master shakespeare i could do it yesterday
sam do me a speech do me a line
parting is such sweet sorrow
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
oh then dear saint let lips do what hands to they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
then have my lips the sin that they have took
sin from my lips oh trespass sweetly urg would give me my sin again
she speaks
i have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here
what satisfaction cangst thou have tonight
the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine
is she obedient
as any mule in christendom but if you are the man to rider her their are rubies in the saddlebag
i like her
so this is the favour you find in the chamberlaings men
you have opened the playhouses
i have master shakespeare
but the plague
yes i know but he was always hanging around the house
i am ethel sir the pirate's daughter
i will be damned if you are
oh what is your name
i have to get back
who is there
will shakespeare
the same alas
oh but why alas
a lowly player
if they find you here they will kill you
you can bring them with a word
oh not for the world
can you love a player
answer me only this are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare
i am
then kiss me again for i am not mistook
it is strange to me too
there is
even your play
well perhaps better than my first 
i must look how pale the window
it was the owlcome to bed
mr henslowe
let him be damned for his pages
ohno no
there is time it is still dark
it is broad day  the rooster tells us so
it was the owl believe me love it was the owl
i must i must
yes some of it is speakable
oh but it is mine too
oh but it will end well for love
what will you have me do marry you instead
then i will go with you
you cannot wessex will kill you
i know how to fight
a literary feud quite normal
you never spoke so well of him
i was the more deceived
oh my love  you ran from me before
if not wessex the queen will know the cause and there will be no more will shakespeare
i am done with theatre the playhouse is for dreamers look where the dream has brought us
it was we ourselves did that and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more then i shall be the sorrier
a comedy what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom sick with love
an excellent beginning  let him bea duke and your heroine
sold in marriage and half way to america
but fearful of her virtue she comes to him dressed as a boy
and thus unable to declare her love
how does it
i do not know it is a mystery
nor you for me
good bye my love a thousand times good bye
write me well
my lord
i have spoken with your father
so my lord i speak with him every day
lord wessex you have been waiting
i am aware of it but it is beauty's privilege
you flatter my lord
it was your eyes no your lips
the queen has consented
she wants to inspect you at greenwich come sunday be submissive modest grateful and brief
i will do my duty my lord
ah my lady the tide waits for no man but i swear it would wait for you
it is not my riding day my lord
bless me i thought it was a horse
i am going to church
i understand of course it is to be expected
it is to be expected on a sunday
and on a day of mourning i never met the fellow but once at your house
mourning who is dead my lord
killed last night in a tavern come then we will say a prayer for his soul
thomas kent i would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player
my hat
where did you learn how to do that
are you mr shakespeare
let me see you take off your hat
do you understand me
no sir
of course you have not i have not written it
if you love her you must do what she asks
and break her heart and mine
it is only ours you can know
she loves me thomas
does she say so
no and yet she does where the ink has run with tears was she weeping when she gave you this
i  her letter came to me by the nurse
your aunt
yes my aunt but perhaps she wept a little tell me how you love her will
like a sickness and its cure together
oh thomas her lips the early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy
and her voice like lark song
deeper softer none of your twittering larks i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song
she sings too
constantly without doubt and plays the lute she has a natural ear and her bosomdid i mention her bosom
what of her bosom
oh thomas a pair of pippins as round and rare as golden apples
for one kiss i would defy a thousand wessexes
it is thomas but of good reputation come there is no harm in a drink
are you bringing your laundry woman
oh my lord you will not shake me off she never needed me more i sear by your breeches
a man my lord
there was a man poeta theatre poet i hearddoes he come to the house
a theatre poet
an insolent pennyapage rogue marlowe he said christopher marlowehas he been to the house
marlowe oh yes he is the one lovely waistcoat shame about the poetry
that dog
you are on my ground
by god i will fight the lot of you
i do not know  campbell or something
i would like to ask you about your hobbies
or maybe just phone out for a pizza
just serve
in the same fashion as chess
will you shut up and play
you are a bad loser
i have not lost yet
you learn that in your psychotherapy group
discussion group alex discussion
about what
about this guy this hugo person
i do not have time
i am only asking what you think
why thank you david
it is true a newspaper is paying for all this a newspaper
alex i do not have the time 
yes or no yes or no yes or 
i am only asking you both to think about it
it is asick idea alex it is sick
he could not get his car started
when are you going to let the police know
you call them if you want
and what about you
dig the pit i do not know
no not that
then what who's going to do what
you know what i am talking about
do i what what what are you talking about
you know what who's going to do it
i do not hear this
i will not be able to
i just thought we should discuss it
take his legs
is that going to be deep enough
is this necessary
yes now come on all or nothing
can we talk about something
not now i have an idea
just stop worrying
i want to talk now
after you drink to love and happiness forever
anyway what i was wanting to say was this 
i do not know
how much did you pay
i do not know
how much
i do not know
there was a breakin
downstairs i know pensioner's terror ordeal page six
i fitted a lock up there on the inside
oh that will come in useful
you are sure there's lots more
no i am sure that will be enough
that is wrong
not eating what
not eating like you used to that is what
if you give me the plate i will eat
looking for you yes
what for what did you want the money was that it
we just wanted to speak to you
i do not know what you are talking about
i beg your pardon
they can know all they like it will not do them the slightest bit of good 
they know
they know so what they have nothing there is nothing to connect us to that bodies stuff
except the money
yeah i was phoning your mother
you old devil well anyway as you can see we are leaving
so i gathered
yeah i am sorry but that is the way it is
it is all right i will forward your mail
for the best exactly i would not want things to end on a downer
not at all
i mean we have had ups and downs right  good times bad times
about the mail 
it is very kind of you to offer but 
where do you think you will go
where will we go where will we go juliet
i do not know anything about it
animals involved i know but you need a change and besides we are short
i do not know
do not know what
this is just an informal discussion
are you recording it
what does it look like
it looks like he is writing everything down
that is because he is does that upset you
no why should it
well then
i have never seen any of these men before
take another look at these two
i do not know them
and if i told you their car was parked outside would that surprise you
yes i suppose so
no not any more i just wondered if it would surprise you
that is all
sorry to waste your time
oh no problems do not worry
just one thing
yes thanks
good well you have seen the flat
oh yes it is great
yes it is is not it we alllike it and the room's nice too do not you think
well yes
i mean what are you actually doing here what is the hidden agenda
just serve
yeah he had one too many of thise urges you of all people should know that
for my life at a discussion group i think not
for the flat
well she had problems 
 more than anyone she has ever met in her whole life
he seemed like a nice guy alex
i do not know he sounded swedish do you know any swedish men maybe it was just the emotion
not usually this drunk
it was you juliet it was you 
 instead of what he is 
what i am
 which is 
 which is a hack
the man we know and love
a miserable burntout empty shell of a  alex pauses looks at his drink then at juliet
know and love
you are right
you see they do not really know me
no alex we do not really love you
no any idea which channel he is on
so i gathered
maybe he did not like us
he is got a car
so that is wrong with that
what sort of car
alex how shouldi know i am just a girl
i will ask you once more what sort of car 
a blue one ok and it is still there
you want me to kick it open
did what
i wonder how he killed himself i presume that that is what happened what do you think
what are you doing
i am just looking
do not
do not look
nothe guy's deadwhat more do you need
it is not every day i find a story in my own flat
thats not a story alex it is a corpse
old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story be rational please and failing that be quiet
i thought we all were
i do not thinki can
but you are a doctor you kill people every day
i do not want to it is different
and now you tell me
for ever and ever
it is not for me it is for love and happiness forever
no i do not
that is he doing here
that is not him
yes it is it is him cameron cameron come on overyo
you were magnificent
who was it
yeah you are making us all nervous
no no it is different
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff
it tastes different
he is right you would feel much better about it
be like a weight off your shoulders
you know we are right
do not you
he cannot stay up there
he will come down leave him alone
yeah he is got to go to work has not he you think he will come down for that
no but he is looking after the money so that is the problem
looking after it  he is probably fucking well eating it
what are you doing here
we have to talk
your painful groin
oh good
he will not do anything for me but for you 
forget it
we could put it somewhere
where he cannot get it
now you thought of that not me
forget it  he will come down
well i am not expecting anyone either
it is the only way
i refuse
you are frightened
i will wait there
and if it sounds like i am being killed you will phone the police you will tell them everything
yes of course why would not i be
we were just sorting things out
oh shut up alex
that is what i thought he said
the perfect couple i should say
you must not take it so badly
do not worry about it i would do exactly the same but i do not think i am his type
do not you ever stop
let him go let him take it all
yeah well that is what she said interesting that is why you are here you see
you mean i can have the room
well that is what i said is not it
it is about the burglary
can we come in
no not that i recall i was asleep
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days
no nothing sorry
well if you do you will let us know
of course
and the other three people on the flat did they hear anything
there are only two other people in the flat
we understood there were four people living here not always of course but now four
no three who said there were four
how strange and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information only three people here you are sure
yes absolutely
i doubt it and these two other people did they hear anything
no they were asleep they did not even wake up
yes why do you think you woke and they did not
i do not know maybe i am a light sleeper
someone lost the key
yeah that is right that is it
you are sure of that
do you smoke
keep it going alex you are unstoppable now
alex i think it is time for you to stop
oh yes i am fine thanks just fine
would you like to talk about it
yes they are my friends
i am sorry
it is alright i think he got the message anyway
that was stressful i found that stressful
two hundred pounds
two hundred pounds
you paid two hundred pounds for this
that is what it cost david
no one i promise
who have you talked to
no one
if i think you are lying 
with a face like this
i should hope so
it was on the television
you and me
oh do not be so coy dear you are going to rio
it was not like that
do not lie to me do not treat me like that
in this firm
well it is a wide range of eh 
accounting david chartered accounting 
exactly what i was 
 is often sneered at are you aware of that
not any real sneering as such no
there's a whole wide world out there and it all needs to be accounted for does not it
i am not sure 
and that is why i think you fit in here
i am boring
you get the job done
oh i see i thought you meant 
which is why i am trusting you with this account
what guy
that guy the one that died
that one last week
oh him well he died

you must be juliet

i would be delighted
would you like to see the rest
a priest who dies
i see
yeah well maybe i will change it
it is a breeze
the telephone it continues to ring
yes the telephone but if it is for me i am not in hugo you are not in

a little bit is that good or bad
it is an improvement
no just leave it he knows i must be at home i am working nights this week
i am a doctor
and he is a patient of yours
no but he needs treatment
for what
a certain weakness
the human condition
you know about it
i write about it
and that is not the same thing
no but like all novelists i am in search of the self
well it is up to you seven six five how will you be paying
i am sorry i have never seen any of them
look again if you like
do you think you have a good memory for faces
same as everyone else
but in your work you must meet lots of different people every day  new people new faces no
i suppose so
i mean that is what it is like

he is going to be ashore with you
with me
that is right
oh no  not tonight josephine
you can both go take a flying jump
remember  he is your date for tonight so smile

what happened
i am engaged
congratulations  who's the lucky girl
i am
what are you talking about you cannot marry osgood
you think he is too old for me
jerry  you cannot be serious
why not  he keeps marrying girls all the time
but you are not a girl  you are a guy and why would a guy want to marry a guy
look stop treating me like a child i am not stupid  i know there's a problem
i will say there is
his mother  we need her approval  but i am not worried  because i do not smoke
jerry  there's another problem
like what
like what are you going to do on your honeymoon
we have been discussing that  he wants to go to the riviera  but i sort of lean toward niagara falls
you are out of your mind  how can you get away with this
oh i do not expect it to last  i will tell him the truth when the time comes
like when
like right after the ceremony
but joe  this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire
look jerry  take my advice  forget the whole thing  just keep telling yourself you are a boy
naturally  you think my fiance is a bum now i guess i will have to give it back
wait a minute  lets not be hasty after all we do not want to hurt poor osgood's feelings
daphne got a proposal tonight
okay joe
but they are from osgood  he wanted me to wear them tonight
what do you think you are doing
we cannot just walk out on her without saying goodbye
since when  usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth
that is when i was a saxophone player now i am a millionaire
drop her a postcard  any minute now those gorillas may be up here 
hello room 414  this is the shiptoshore operator  i have a call for miss sugar cane

there you go with that we again
first thing we got to do is get out of these clothes
yeah but they are not watching yachts come on  you are going to call osgood

where did he conduct
on the baltimore and ohio
do not get me started on that  want a drink  it is bourbon
sugar you are going to get yourself into a lot of trouble
better keep a lookout
i am not very bright i guess
i would not say that  careless maybe
i used to sing with male bands but i cannot afford it any more
afford it
have you ever been with a male band
you cannot trust those guys
i cannot trust myself  the moment i would start with a new band  bingo
every time
you know  i play tenor sax
but you are a girl thank goodness
you are
that is a quarter of a century makes a girl think
about what
about the future  you know  like a husband  that is why i am glad we are going to florida
that is in florida
millionaires  flocks of them  they all go south for the winter  like birds
going to catch yourself a rich bird
maybe you will meet one too josephine
yeah  with money like rockefeller and shoulders like johnny weismuller 
i want mine to wear glasses
well now that you have mentioned it 
i hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop
search me  i mean  i will see
i might as well stay in there i will not be able to sleep anyway
why not
would you mind terribly
not at all
good night sugar
i will bet there is not one of them under seventyfive
seventyfive  that is threequarters of a century  makes a girl think
so do i  but do not worry  we will be seeing a lot of each other
what makes you so sure
just my feminine intuition
she does not need one  i do not have one either
my fault
you are not hurt are you
i do not think so
i wish you would make sure
thank you
who are you
now really 
not very likely
are you staying at the hotel
not at all
your face is familiar
possible you saw it in a newspaper  or magazine  vanity fair 
that must be it
would you mind moving just a little you are blocking my view
your view of what
they run up a redandwhite flag on the yacht when it is time for cocktails
you have a yacht
no my flag steward
and who mixes the cocktails  your wife
no my cocktail steward  look if you are interested in whether i am married or not 
i am not interested at all
well i am not
that is very interesting
up up up
i will bet just while we were talking you made like a hundred thousand dollars
could be  do you play the market
no  the ukulele  and i sing
for your own amusement
well  a group of us are appearing at the hotel sweet sue and her society syncopators
you are society girls
oh yes  quite  you know  vassar bryn mawr  we are only doing this for a lark
syncopators  does that mean you play that fast music  jazz
yeah  real hot
oh  well i guess some like it hot  but personally i prefer classical music
so do i  as a matter of fact i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music
good school  and your family does not object to your career
 opening of the opera 
 riding to hounds 
 and always the same four hundred
i beg your pardon
you see i have this theory about men with glasses
what theory
maybe i will tell you when i know you a little better  what are you doing tonight
i would like to  but it may be rather difficult
you collect shells
please  no names  just call me junior
yes you are in the way  he is waiting for a signal from his yacht
it is been delightful meeting you both
and you will come to hear us tonight
if it is at all possible 
shell oil junior  he is got millions  he is got glasses  and he is got a yacht
you do not say
maybe you would better go after him  if you do not want to lose him
oh i am not going to let this one get away he is so cute  collects shells
shells  whatever for
i am
because he said he is coming to hear us play  maybe
well you know how those millionaires are  these came for you
for me  it is shell oil
it is not how long you wait  it is who you are waiting for
i wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of long island is fogged in
it is the thought that counts
it is sort of funny  you being out of gas  i mean shell oil and everything 
looks like they are on the wrong track
do you mind riding backwards it may take a little longer 
it is not how long it takes  it is who's taking you
my dad is more interested in railroads baltimore and ohio  which is the port and which is the starboard
yes  now let's see  where do you suppose the steward set it up
yes  that is our hurricane cellar
of course  on thursdays they always serve me in the small salon
it is all right for a bachelor
what a beautiful fish
caught him off cape hatteras
what is it
oh  a member of the herring family
a herring  is not it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars
they shrink when they are marinated
down the hatch  as we say at sea
bon voyage
trophies  you know  skeetshooing dogbreeding water polo
water polo  is not that terribly dangerous
i will say  i had two ponies drowned under me
where is your shell collection
yea of course  now where could they have put it  on thursdays i am sort of lost around here
that is on thursdays
it is the crews' night off
you mean we are alone on the boat
well of course i am sure you are a gentleman
oh it is not that it is just that i am  harmless
harmless  how
well i do not know how to put it  but i have this thing about girls
what thing
they just sort of leave me cold
you mean  like frigid
it is more like a mental block  when i am with girls it does nothing to me
have you tried
have i  i am trying all the time
nothing at all
complete washout
that makes me feel just awful
i do not want to bore you
oh you could not possibly
ever since then   numb  no feelings  like my heart was shot full of novocaine
you poor poor boy
yes  all the money in the world  but what good is it  mint sauce or cranberries
how can you think about food at a time like this
what else is there for me 
is it that hopeless
thanks just the same
if i ever found a girl that could  i would marry her like that
what is it
i am afraid not  terribly sorry
would you like a little more champagne  and maybe if we had some music    how do you dim these lights
it is like smoking without inhaling
so inhale
lets throw another log on the fire
i must be  because your glasses are beginning to steam up
thank you
where did you learn to kiss like that
oh you know  junior league  charity bazaars  i used to sell kisses for the milk fund

eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars

it is the most beautiful place in the universe
sounds ok to me let's go
it is everywhere but water is always the door
yes i see it shining like a jewel
that is home
this is the phantom zone but why did you come here from argo city
i was on earth
earth you crossed the dimension barrier by yourself
yes i went there to find the lost power source
but the person who has it tricked me and sent me to the phantom zone
it is dangerous to use a power source on earth it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces
i know
what palace hardly
just feels a little like a tiny bit of argo city
what kind of a question is that of course i am i do whatever i want all the time
but what about other people do not you miss them
the phantom zone overlooks everywhere if you have the right tools
told you would not listen to me knew it would make you sad
of course my dear what can i do
help me to get back to earth where my friends are they need me
if there's a way in there must be a way out
no that is not truethere's wellno
i knew it
but it is impossible
leave the zone what would i do on earth
you could do anything you could sculpt mountain rangesdraw with rainbows you would have superpowers
superpowers got you in a lot of trouble did not they
going to try did not say i could
better than when i was a child
do not stop keep moving
yes must not stop
it is selena i am getting so i can recognise her work
too late too late save yourself

your nephew does not want a drink
and with ten percent of his future you are great too frank

four five nights ago  that is how i know the romance is off  also steve's in a very bad mood
listen frank you would better make sure you are telling me the truth
i am late for a date with a dame

if it were that easy you would not find an empty phone booth for the next two hours
i see you are full of human feelings
give me a chance 
hurry back
i will by that son  now you owe me a favor  be good to my kid sister
why has he bothered you before
is it news to you
son lots of people tell me i am a gifted man but i still cannot see around corners
no punch line  maybe i was just admiring your knowhowyours and falco's
why do you keep coupling me with falco
right now you are in no position to ask questions  and your snide remarks
you hear that susie  continue please
i am afraid i cannot cope with them

ten will get you fifty you are playing hookey from a padded cell
did sidney tell you about it
yes he phoned  i do not know this boy too well  anything in these charges
no i am not  i am not
history repeats itself  everything that happened to alan lesliebegan with a smear like this

i would not have called the boy exactly balanced
who said sidney
i said sidney
i thought we were talking about sidney

why does everything you say sound like a threat
bonna sera commendatore  come sta

she mighta jumped  love suicide  check it for me philit is a real heart throb
i do not believe it

i am a schoolboy  teach me teach me
why not break it up yourself  you could do it in two minutes flat
i do not
correct me if i am wrong but i do not think so
i will listen one more minute
you mean they have been fired already on the basis of this crude smear
he means that much to you
yes  with your prestige it only takes a minute  ten cents worth of american tel and tel
you are picking up my lingo hon
i read your column every day
with a pocket fulla firecrackers  good
cannot hurt  i had to get him back his job
no that is the point  he will not accept your favor  the manager yes but not the boy
sure he steams her up  wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz
and who's feet is she on now
presumably yours  that is according to st dallas
that is this boy got that susie likes
integrity  acute like indigestion
what does that mean  integrity
wild  take a look at them and see who's wild
sidney i know human nature  susie lied to me  she will see that boy again
how does it matter who's sister the main thing they are through and 
talk to her yourself
you are incapable of the truth
i call him the boy with the ice cream face

what about
something about a frank d'angelo trying to reach you

let's wait till christmas  it is more legitimate then
you are sure  find out for me
sidney can i talk to you a minute
at the bar  sidney
no  that is what i mean  i am being fired for what i did not do
staring  consequently when he approached me on his way out i was not surprised but i did not let on
he was writing a special sunday piece on
cigarette girls and naturally 
you were thrilled to be interviewed  were you interviewed
in his apartment 
and where was his wife

what sort of thing
this sort of thing

what would you think of me if 
nothing i did not think of you before

he wants me to break a leg
that makes five days in a row that mr hunsecker's cut you out of his column

i am just like him
nobody worried about your father

your brother  will you come with me
that is this about
it is a private matter for you i think you will be more comfortable
where is my brother
he could not or refused to pay  we extended credit
look where is he
because if you do not know about society you do not have the satisfaction of avoiding it
i know who she is  take a message
i would not mention the following except he was very insistent  it is obviously some sort of prank
what gentleman maria
a mister seymour butts
pardon me  i am afraid i do not
cancel lunch  make reservations at campton place for me and mr butts
why are you following me
i do not know what you are talking about  i am just driving
is alan baer the game  is that what this is
friend why do not you back off
nothing  nothing at all
wanted to wish you luck  not that you will need it
i checked it personally
follow me
it was a misunderstanding
you know you can
find out about a company called crs  consumer recreation services
sounds like they make tennis rackets what do we know
just what i told you
nothing else
you are joking
it is what they do  it is like being toyed with by a bunch of  depraved children
sam  thank you
what about the house
attempted murder
greetings fellow insomniac
greetings fellow sheep counter
uh nell vance
and what kind of sleeper
well i uh
obsessive worrier  join the club  and you  i would guess
who's watts
come on  these are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist
i did okay
it is somebody's idea of a joke
there's a carriage house around back
do we still get paid for the week
you get your money
it is a question
she got the child labor stuff from me
just stay there nell
he must have left  did not like the looks of the place or something
you could have
so could you  is this some fucked up idea of art putting someone else's name to a painting
you do not really believe it is haunted do you believe in ghosts
maybe someday
where in the hell can she be
but if the group knows it is being studied as a group you contaminate the results  the deception is minor
mary i will meet you outside
you do not believe in the paranormal
no but she does and that is all that matters
does she know that is why you are using her
she needed a job malcolm  and she is smart  and she helps me
i have a bad feeling about what you are doing
this is the last chapter  please please give me clearance  it is for science
you can call me nell dr marrow
nell  good enough  and i am jim
i am really honored to be part of this study jim
well we are glad to have you
but there's a sad catch to the story
theo i think  you have asked us that three times doctor marrow that is going on
how do you feel about luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing  water hammer something like that
that smell oh god
it was very specific
all right
i was not thinking about my mother's bathroom
what happened after you smelled it
i looked at theo  she had a look on her face
like she smelled it too
i got more scared
no you are not  something moved you  you saw something
i do not know
it was a stupid thing to do
it was
welcome home
and they are all locked together in here and he will not let go of them
nell  you will come here now
nell the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here
then who called me
how would i know it was for you
because it is my phone  yes mrs dudley just leave the boxes inside thank you  see you soon  thank you
that  that is hill house

every day  basically we will be hanging out together like we have so far this evening
good morning theo  luke
mary came with me
it is okay we are all here
how could you do this to people
yes  but i promised i would not let her alone the whole night
nell what do we do
but the experiment was a failure
oh  you scared me
me  no  what are you doing here

yeah i am mister dudley the caretaker  what are you doing here
mrs dudley will be waiting for you
mrs dudley
so far
i have seen 'em  lot to dust
well i have never lived with beauty  you must love working here
no one will come any nearer than that
this  it is from a thrift shop
what did it cost
fifteen dollars
that would be seventy in new york you stole it
it is all i could afford
wait  you are not wearing that ironically  this is really you
i do not know what you mean
that is why we are here
what do you do
do not tell me boston is different from new york
ohh sure you have trouble with commitment
you are okay
the taj mahal was not a palace it was a tomb  why did not he tell us
yes  i have missed it
no  the world has missed you
you too  happy tossing and turning
you know it was not a joke theo
i guess  oh your hair  it looks good
two sets  i do not know  maybe they are not even his
no it is getting worse
maybe you did it yourself
there's hundreds of them  this must be a record of the children who died at the mills like luke said
before he painted your name over mister crain
just think about one thing right now what color
i have a loft
i do not know you know
i think so
carolyn showed me where she hid him hid him with all the ones he killed 
 but the painting
i do not think i want any
i do

i used to hate it  now i like it
could be worse he could have named you reticulum
i uwantu to know why you uneedu that scary guy in your house
gordon  he is been with me for years he is not as tough as he looks
then what good is he
is it possible that you are too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty
is that a problem
not for you clearly
i am loyal to things that make me happy
am i a thing
well you are certainly not a person
i am not
no  you are not specific enough to be a person  you are more like a vibe
i am so glad we are having this chat
it is not a knock
it is not a compliment
it is an observation  like  i am hungry when are we eating
as soon as you get dressed
what kind of food
anything but japanese
like you
i do not like doityourself cuisine buffets  salad bars
you demand to be served  a fork fetishist
it is just fuel to me  i am not there for distractions
for some eating is a sensual experience utheu sensual experience
that is what gordongs always saying
oh god
we all did
it must have been a time  a golden moment
i am a gracious host
all your life  that happened while i swam the length of my pool
nothing  i guess it is hard to pass on this road
the freeway's faster but lacks a certain majesty
just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time
i sure hope so
we think
we cannot find    two of our guys
not bad
how would you like to kill someone for me
where do we go
when you find the guy you will know
what shit is this  i just do it  i do not prepare it
what kind
what the papers used to call a gangland slaying
our black friends
no terry  they do not work like that jenny wilsongs father paid a little visit left a message
i thought he was in prison in england
why because you are my security consultant  this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down
what did you tell them
heavier than that now  but are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story
as it happens  i did not make that part up
and where is this guest  do not they want to interview him
i do not know everyone here  he was so traumatized he split  maybe he was gordongs upusheru
we will find him
no  i mean  not even your people should be involved  right  it is too close now
you could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here

proprietor of a london firm  of longstanding
i see
based in london but with international concerns
i bet
various enterprises style of thing
i thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life

why no mr martins
a friend of mine offered me a job here
where are you staying
with him  fifteen stiffgasse
his name
we have free will and intelligence  which god allegedly gave us
there's midrash supporting this my father read a book by shalom spiegel that  isaac actually died and was reborn
no one follows that midrash
what are you doing here i thought you were a nazi
i rest my case he is a jewish nazi he always was
whereas avi's a zionist nazi
the zionists are not nazis
they are racist they are militaristic they act like bullyboys in the territories
they do not have extermination camps
they had sabra and shattila
they sound like you
are you shitting me right in the store
she is been giving me the eye she is hot so i wait till the owner goes up front
he is an asshole
that is a movie you moron
fine go ahead touch the letters
who the fuck are you
then i will not bring you
read imein kampfi hitler had all his best ideas in prison
we will go to the country sometime okay
yeah he is a respected scholar even noam chomsky says he 
i do not but
let's look at the fucking thing
why the fuck not
just do not
i have a job
this this is a joke  i will give your group a thousand bucks
you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine
fifty's an exaggeration anyway that was a different moment things were possible that are not now
actually i think this moment has possibilities that 
yeah i read your piece it is very smart and very wrong
you will
you are a jew maybe you do not realize it but you are
maybe i am maybe we are all jews now that is the difference
nobody reads that stuff anymore
too difficult
too christian you know jameson paul virilio
the point is the modern world is a jewish disease
disease what disease
abstraction they are obsessed with abstraction
at first no one will know why the victims are being killed
i work at the big boy warehouse in queens i drive a forklift
where would you read all that stuff
i just read it
you want it to be an event
and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms
how come so many of the books are in spanish
he is in a mental institution he is been there for ten years off and on mostly on
is he a nazi
i guess his parents are he does not care about that
that is he care about
killing himself
that is stupid why would they
yes i am basically i am
you were not complaining about my play last time
oh really
bigger and better
then how come you are talking to me
why will not you talk to me
i am talking to you right now who's linda
you cannot
he is at a home out here
i stole it from a synagogue
what do you care
'cause i want to know what is this word this one here
oh yeah 
vayomer adonai el avram lech lecha mayartzcha oomimohladtcha oom'bayt avaycha el haertez asher arecha
that is it mean
i am good at languages
why not
they think it is the word of god and it is holy and the flesh is not
that is stupid
yeah it is stupid  put it on or i will not teach you
you cannot curse in front of it either
good question both  aleph
it looks a little like a swastika
it is silent it holds a place takes a vowel the vowels are little dots that go under the letters
where are they
even though his dick is so big
with you there's a tragic dimension
christianity's silly but at least there's something to believe in or not believe judaism there's nothing
nothing but nothingnessjudaism's not about belief
that is it about
about doing things you light candles say prayers keep the sabbath visit the sick
and belief follows
do not curse in front of it
why should i submit
you should not
you think i should just because there's no reason
judaism does not even need god you have the torah the law that is your fucking god  the book's closed
i told you i am good at this
plus you have nothing else to do all day
oh am i learning it faster than you did maybe i am smarter
it is all you talk about jewish jewish jewish nobody talks about it that much except the jews
do they
is that why you became a nazi so you could talk about jews incessantly
you want a punch in the mouth
okay  why do not we light candles on friday let's light candles and say the kaddish
kaddish is the prayer for the dead
lina come here
is it like eichmann are we goofing
i do not know i just want to try it
shit  did you talk to your mother today
no what are you looking for
nothing  why are you doing this  i thought god did not exist
he commands it whether he exists or not  look we can fight him and be crushed or we can submit
and be crushed
you gotta get out of here
you do not own this place
yeah i remember kill any jews yet
i did not realize you cared
i do not i was just curious how full of shit you were
did you know that there was a inew york timesi reporter there that night
really which one i bet it was the guy with the prada shoes
i did not notice his shoes did your mother know he was there
i doubt it how did you find out
he called me up he wanted to talk to me about my ideas
why do not you come visit we will have a rematch
i will go look
who's eichmann
what would you say
nothing let's go
i am stealing it
he is jewish manzetti
people hate jews do you agree
they used to today it is not an issue
i would say nothing after two or three people will try to find a pattern a reason
but when it comes out the public will be outraged it will look like germany all over again
is not that what we want germany all over again only done right this time
how would you kill him
they are liars and cowards
i am sure they are but what do we accomplish by pointing it out
it is the truth
what about mrs moebius and
that is that  okay surprise us
that does not seem to be happening does it
no yeah fine go ahead so that is this about is this about me
curtis is a politician  and a bit of a hustler he is not a thinker
i agree
the other night you said the modern world is a jewish disease could you elaborate on that
what should i be a white inferior ist a multicultural zulu egalitarian let me ask where are your people from
my mother's family is french my father's was german originally
let me give you an example sexuality
sexuality what do you mean
you ever fuck a jewish girl
that is that go to do withi have gone out with a with jewish women why
and what did you notice
notice like what
jewish girls like to give head right
i do not know is that right
and jewish men like to get it
everybody likes to do not they
yes it is very pleasurable but the jews are obsessed with it you know why
you are not listening he is not better he gives pleasure but that is actually a weakness
danny what makes you think you know all this
let's just say i have done due diligence
those are not jews
of course they are jews
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park
who how would i know him
he says you were bar mitzvahed there in march 1988
you believe that and you call yourself a reporter
so you are saying it is not true
look at me  do i look jewish  look
do you know who you are fucking with here
that is what i am trying to find out danny who am i fucking with here
listen to me
why would nadelman lie
it is slander it is reckless disregard i will sue you and your fucking jew paper
does that mean you deny what he says is true yes or no
what were you following me
how do you reconcile the two
i do not look stay out of what you do not understand
explain it so i can
you work for the inew york timesi your whole job in life is not to understand things like me
i do not think you know what you are
yeah and what are you a itimesi man a presbyterian impotent a prick
who killed manzetti
if i tell you will you pull the story not write about me
the arguments anyway
to hear them read torah
i thought you hated torah
that does not mean i do not like hearing it
point out all the lies and fuckedup thinking
this is me
how did you
i work in the da's office you go to those meetings half the people there are informants

daniel balint
what part of germany are you people from
from the rhineland originally

i was going to ask you the same thing
curtis is afraid you will marginalize us
ilio manzettiformer ambassador to france managing partner at damon schwarzchild
you mean ilio manzetti
forget manzetti take on something simple something you can actually accomplish  maybe he would be more valuable in the city
what is happening
beth shalom like you wanted
beth shalom what are you talking about who is this
lina you said if i was going to plant a bomb i should 
that is meat
the bible only says do not seethe a kid in its mother's milk but chickens do not give milk
look you want cheese go someplace else
but it is stupid right you admit it is stupid
no i do not admit it is stupid
you can have chicken with eggs but not with milk why is that
i am not here to talk about religious law if you do not like 
but you already talked about it you said it is not stupid why is not it stupid
i just came to get some stuff i will be out in five minutes  he does not want me around

do what mr lombard
check with your sons bank banks dont usually give out information about their customers
then you should not have sought an explanation
i presume you checked your sons apartment
yesterday it all looked normal
did you look for his passport driving licence
leonard does not hold a driving licence as for his passport i do not know where he keeps it
so he could have decided to go on a trip
he could indeed mr lombard but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it
then why arent you asking the police to look for your son mrs spitz
no and before you ask no hes not gay he has had girlfriends but nothing serious
any friends

well it is the only one i have it is gotten me out of quite a few tight spots
i will work on it
is this leading somewhere
limestone quarry southern mansion easy to get them mixed up i say we invite ourselves to the party
absolutely  have to look for clues even if it means dancing with beautiful women

my disguise  and here
call me that again and you are going to find a boot where it does not belong
quite  come let's mingle
do your own mingling  i am not hanging around with some dandy named chauncey
all right  how about this  we put a watch on this pemberton somebody tries to grab him
then we have got our proof excellent  and where do we find this fortunate scientist
you are either having a seizure or you just said hello
good i was not sure you were up to it
all what
all that jumping and kicking
i am going to hit you
it is a repeating steam cannon
hey i tried the board
at least the thing's not that fast we just follow it  whenever it stops we are there waiting
that is right that is good
what way is that
so spontaneous  all that leaping off buildings and chinese fighting and whatnot
spontaneous  i like that  most people say something like hare brained reckless sonofabitch
well that too
those kids they took my wagon never got it back
uh how long ago was this
i was six  and ever since my policy is act first and worry later
i thought all you needed were your fists and your gun
i find most criminals slip up somewhere
you really enjoy yourself do not you
sure  we have no idea that is going on
thank you
come on let's at least see if we can find dr pemberton
you go ahead  i will stick with loveless
sure  it is a windup thing
a cylinder recorder  my own design
shhh  come on  tell us something
it is better than nothing
it is
he is going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named willard
you would think if loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen
sounds like a train  looks like a train
yes  and a much nicer one than ours
it is a town
that rules out willard vermont willard minnesota  willard new mexico
relax  we are almost there
