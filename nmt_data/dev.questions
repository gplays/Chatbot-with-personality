as you know my husband passed away recently two weeks ago now
my condolences
his passing has left me with something of a dilemma a terrible terrible dilemma
do you carry a gun mr welles
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to other than that there s never any reason
do you want to tell me what you found
it is a film of a girl being murdered
if you were to study it you would see the camera cutting away you would see the tricks they can play
i am telling you it is not that
i am sure it is it is probably something your husband was given as a bad joke more than likely he never even watched it
will you watch it and see for yourself
you you need to go to the police
i told you i cannot not yet
i deal in divorce cases corporate investigations
you have found missing persons before
my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
i am not positive this means anything
okay i follow you so far
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
you are joking
i am here
send it to me through the post office like we arranged no return address you dug this up all by yourself
you told me to look so i looked
mrs christian tom welles here

the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12 09
all right if the boy proves an alibi he is all right is not he
all i know is the bank s been robbed and a murder s been committed the way i see it brown here looks guilty

you are not trying to run away
jesus christ
friend of yours did you help him out of a bind
the one about the witch
your mom says i cannot tell you that one anymore you get nightmares
you are in for a surprise
am i
having a kid changes everything i mean there s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings
you think i am up for it
truly i saw it in the eye
the old lady by the swamp
she was a witch
no she was old and probably senile maybe schizophrenic
i saw my death in that eye and this is not how it happens
so how does it happen
what did he say
when did you ever work in an office
there s a lot you do not know about me
dad i am hoping we can talk about some things while i am here
you mean while i am here
your mother has not been keeping up the pool if you wanted to you could
i will
you know where the chemicals are
i thought you were not dying
why not religion dad
josephine actually went to the congo last year
the maple tree and the buick we heard it
i am trying to make a metaphor here
what you are seeing down to my nose my chin
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
you think i am fake
what do you want will who do you want me to be
yourself good bad everything just show me who you are for once
the river
tell me how it happens
how what happens
i can try dad if you help just tell me how it starts
like this
let s get out of here
where are we headed
you say
it is unbelievable
you become what you always were a very big fish and that is the way it happens
i am sorry
they are your favorite flower
how did you get so many
you do not even know me
how can i convince you to stop
i was drying out
wait i need those
this is why you do not show work in progress
norther do you ever regret not making it to paris
i cannot imagine any place better than here
it is me norther winslow
so what are you up to now
this is it the whole vault
fraid so
how did you know my father
were you and my father having an affair
can i ask you a question why did you come here today if you found this deed why did not you just ask eddie
logically you could not be the witch because she was old back when he was young
no it is logical if you think like your father see to him there s only two women your mother and everyone else
i spent a week in morocco for the story it was incredible
i am going to get started on dishes
i am going to check on him
i am sorry it seems every hour i have to
do you like it being pregnant
it is bad
it is more than they thought they are going to stop chemo
you need to go
i am going with you
you do not have to
i talked with your father last night
you never told me how your parents met
they met at auburn
what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that
that is because most of it never happened
mmm what
do you love your father
everyone loves my father he is a very likeable guy
but it is not true
look i know why you like him i know why everyone likes him but i need you to tell me i am not crazy
you are not
i need you on my side
what happened
your father had a stroke he is upstairs with your mom and dr bennett
how did you get here
we swam the atlantic it is not that big really
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport
we rented a car
is that dr bennett s car
how much time does he have left
i do not know if you have seen it but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek
mom would you say you understand dad
of course
would you say you understand josephine
but i understand you mom i always have
before i forget your father has papers in the basement i would like you to go through i would not know that is important
was she one of your teachers
no but it is weird she seemed to recognize me
that really happened
is he awake
did you and dad have any other property
i suppose your grandmother s house when she passed on but we sold that right away your cousin shirley bought it
so you never bought any land
i do not suppose one of us could stay with him in case he in case he wakes up one of us should be there
i will stay why do not you go home with josephine and i will stay tonight
mom do you want some time with dad
i sent a trunk home yesterday this is all i have
you look good jeffrey did you have a nice flight
i think it is important not to get depressed depression is a terrible thing they say it can bring on illness

maybe but i think the yellow man is on drugs i think frank supplies him
then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man s place
jeffrey why
i am seeing something that was always hidden i am involved in a mystery i am learning and it is all secret
you like mysteries that much

i do not know why we have to watch tv
sandy could i talk to you a minute
hey come here you stole my girl you bastard i am gonna kick your ass right in front of your stupid house
stop it mike
i have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand
ninety seven million minus eight corrected to mass critical
i am getting this flickering light on one of my panels
what flickering light
the one on unit oh i think it is gmr twelve zero zero
oh that is wrong now
i am not sure i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship though
i can tell the damn thing just does not understand
that is he doin
the key
key key what is the key
where is the fail safe key
the key
where is it what did you do with it
i do not have it i do not know where it is
the key goddamit the key
christ twenty seconds christ
where is the key
it did not go off
oh god
it did not go off
we have got to disarm the bomb
what was that i did not hear
what the hell
pinback i have a computer reading of nine five seven seven
well now what what do you have for us now boiler
not much nothing at all in this sector
find me something i do not care where it is
well i show a 95 probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula
fuck that shit
well it is kind of a long shot
it is a goddamn wild goose chase remember when commander powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud
all right then
sounds good chart a course for the veil nebula
why does not talby ever eat down here with the rest of us
quantum is up thirty five
rechannel all safety relays
talby talby can you read me
can you beat that i always knew talby was weird
well bomb we have about sixty seconds to drop just wondering if everything is all right have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
energy shielding positive function
swell let s synchronize detonation time do you know when you are supposed to go off
check at six minutes
fail safe in lock four minutes to drop 22 minutes to detonation this is sergeant pinback calling bomb 20 do you read me bomb
one hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
energy shielding positive function
do you remember the detonation time
detonation in twenty minutes
but you cannot explode in the bomb bay it is foolish you will kill us all there s no reason for it
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
therefore i shall ignore you
hello bomb
false data can act only as a distraction therefore i shall refuse to perceive you
hey bomb
snap out of it bomb
hey bomb
i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds detonation will occur at the programmed time
bomb this is doolittle you are not to detonate repeat you are not to detonate in the bomb bay disarm yourself this is an order
hello bomb are you with me
of course
are you willing to entertain a few concepts
i am always receptive to suggestions
well of course i exist
but how do you know you exist
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
hmm well i think therefore i am
that is good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists
this is fun
why that would mean i really do not know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
that is it
intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
why do not you have more time
now bomb consider this next question very carefully what is your one purpose in life
to explode of course
and you can only do it once right
that is correct
and you would not want to explode on the basis of false data would you
of course not
well then you have already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
yes well
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
so if you detonate in
nine seconds
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
i have no proof that it was false data
ah what would you say pinback
mafhkin oble groop
ah what was that again i still cannot hear you
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction
yes doolittle
i need a computer reading on a fail safe mark
in a second
new star hey guess what i got a new star on the readout
which one
another unknown not on the charts a red dwarf
any planets
yeah eight it says here
any of em any good
the new star what are you gonna name it
commander powell would have named it
hey doolittle think we will ever find real intelligent life out there
out where
veil nebula
mark at 5 4 3 2 1 drop
open circuit breakers
remove thrust drive repellant
hello pinback are you there
i need a diameter approximation
you know talby you really ought to eat with the rest of us you spend too much time up here
i like it up here
should spend some time below see more of the rest of the ship
you know what i think about talby
i am getting something here on this readout
it is funny but i kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself
i cannot seem to locate the malfunction exactly
waves would be peaking really high and glassy hit that water riding the wall just perfect
somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
ah doolittle i do have a malfunction on this readout but i cannot seem to pinpoint exactly where it is
do not worry about it we will find out when it goes bad
i really think i should try and locate it immediately might be something important
lieutenant doolittle this is talby lieutenant
ah lieutenant doolittle sir
sh talby do not bother me now
ah well i think i have found the malfunction sir i am in the emergency air lock
not now
doolittle help me
doolittle doolittle where are you
here i am i think i am spinning we are both falling talby in opposite directions away from each other my my jetpack s gone
oh yeah
it is doolittle it is the phoenix they glow with all the colors of the rainbow just like everybody said
no kidding
commander powell this is doolittle ah there s something serious come up sir and i have to ask you something
doolittle you must tell me one thing
that is that sir
tell me doolittle how are the dodgers doing
well sir the dodgers broke up disbanded over thirteen years ago
ah pity pity
yes sir negative effect
what was that doolittle
negative effect
it did not work
that is correct sir
sorry doolittle i have forgotten so much since i have been in here so much
what should we do sir the time is running out
commander powell commander hello
doolittle hello
commander are you still there
oh yes doolittle i am thinking
we are running out of time sir
talk to the bomb
i already have sir and pinback is talking to it now
men men what happened men
i do not know honey it is horrible
maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on just make a clean break
you were not supposed to see that
they cannot erase memories it is a joke it is a nasty clementine hoax

egad were you horrified
right something black though
i will buy that black s always good
we did talk about naomi
i said are you sure you seem unsure
i am sure i said
but you were not i could tell
i thought i was foolish i thought i would mistaken infatuation for love you said
so what infatuation is good too
i dropped you off after you said
come up and see me now
it is very late
i told her today i need to end it
is that what you want
i did not think you would show your face around me again i figured you were humiliated you did run away after all
i would like to take you out or something
well you are married
i remember that speech really well
i had you pegged did not i
i still thought you were going to save me even after that
i know
it would be different if we could just give it another go around
you said
i saw you sitting over here by yourself i thought thank god someone normal who does not know how interact at these things either
you know what i did
yeah i know i am fishing
i am clementine can i borrow a piece of your chicken
oh god how horrid
you mean like oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin clementine huckleberry hound that sort of thing
yeah like that
this is it joel it is gonna be gone soon
i know
what do we do
no i stopped i did not want to feel like i was being artificially modulated
i know what you mean that is why i stopped
but my sleeping is really fucked up
have you ever read any anna akhmatova
i love her
really me too i do not meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store
i think she is great
me too there s this poem
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
i think before
seems too coincidental that way
do you know her poem that starts seaside gusts of wind and a house in which we do not live
yeah yeah it goes perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines
i wish we did you married
um no
what are you doing
c mon man the water s fine nobody s coming here tonight believe me this place is closed up electricity s off
i hesitated for what seemed like forever
i knew
i knew by your nervousness that naomi was not the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
it is dark
ah ha now i can look for candles matches and the liquor cabinet
what if you stay this time
i walked out the door there s no more memory
bye joel
do not worry it is really solid this time of year
i do not know what if it breaks
i think i should go back
listen did you want to make love
make love
have sex y know
oh um
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now
that is okay i
i am sorry i just wanted to say that this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and
hey joel
and i am just too nervous around you right now
i am nervous too
yeah i would not have thought that
well you obviously do not know me
says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling
says you were a bully
a bully moi
that is what it says you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
well sounds like me sorry man says you were jealous and suspicious
says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it
i do not know
does not sound like me
i sort of do but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality cleaned up enough to be erotic
you are still excited by my irreverence you have not yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock
i cannot stop thinking about you
yay meet me after work by the old mill
what old mill is that somewhere we
what took you so long
i just walked in
hmmm do you miss me
oddly enough i do
ha ha you said i do i guess that means we are married
i guess so
did you send this is it a joke
i probably got the same thing as you
i mean i have not even told anyone i have met you who would even know to do this

we can help you through this why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine
we can help you through this why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about

i heard in the federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your daddy on father s day
after this one i am out cat you understand this is the last time we talk to each other

harry called you his associate but what does that mean i never heard your name or read it in variety or the reporter or anyplace

i am a producer
you have a card in here
your wife a lakers fan
by the way you recall the number of the locker you used
it was c i do not know sixteen or seventeen one of those why you looking for anyway a bomb or something
something should not be there
why do not you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look maybe you will find it
that is the idea i will think about it
that is what i would do make sure i got the right guy next time
hey chil since you are going out to l a anyway
what have you got
guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand sixty days over a movie producer
jesus if i have a heart attack i hope you know what to do

that is what i am doing
you know dick allen mesa s casino
operator how do i get las vegas information
a marker s like a check harry
you are not looking at me harry

karen say hello to chili palmer chili this is karen flores
you want to hear this idea it is about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand go on tell her

the shylock s the good guy

i am not the guy harry
but you work for the casino
i am out here looking for leo i just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend dick allen
is that right that is what you do for a living
i imagine in your line of work there were times you had to get rough you know say one of your customers stopped paying
you pack a gun
not really
what does that mean
maybe a few times i have
really you ever been arrested
i have been picked up a couple times loan sharking racketeering but i was never convicted i am clean
you got that on the brain harry if you are so scared of em why would you take their money to vegas to begin with
because i need half a million to buy a script
for a movie
a blockbuster but quality no mutants or maniacs this one s gonna be my driving miss daisy
that is it called
mr lovejoy
mr lovejoy that is the title
two time academy award nominee martin weir
martin weir he played the mob guy that turned snitch in the cyclone
one of his best parts
no his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt whitney
he drown
that or i am thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow saffrin –
i am not gonna pop her harry
you do not even know these guys
harry i probably know em better than you do
what do you get out of this
lovejoy sits behind the wheel watching the bar across the street getting his video camera ready for action that is he doing following a guy
they will be looking at you they do not know who you are
i do not know maybe i was not clear but i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut
i had to tell em something
how is anyone gonna see anything from way up there
hey harry
here s your keys harry
is he giving you a check or cash
okay harry i am wrong you are not the one he is setting up
yeah he wants us to talk to buddy set up a meeting
forget about leo s money harry
ray barboni guy from miami owns leo now that momo died
maybe i oughta talk to this ray bones character myself see if he wants to invest in my movie
you got a miss leo devoe guy s six weeks over
he died
yeah ray he personally told me he got killed in that get away airlines jet went down last month
what get away jet
it was in the herald
yeah well maybe the guy took out flight insurance check with the wife
which also means when i speak i am speaking for jimmy so e g as of now you start affording me the proper respect
e g means for example ray i think what you wanna say is i e
bullshit e g is short for ergo
you owe me the dry cleaner s fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another uhh
yeah that was a good party
we talk different
it is more like your attitude your tone your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves in your opinions your indifference to conventional views
so you do not know what i am thinking
no i do not though i have to say i am curious
so you want to know
if you would like to tell me yeah
i am thinking of a movie
one of mine
one we are producing
martin i am not connected to those people anymore not since i walked out of a loanshark operation in miami
what happened the pressure got to you
guy owes me fifteen large and takes off i go after him the fuck you think i do
martin look at me
like this
what you are telling me you are tired you wanna go to bed
wait how about this
how about this
that is not bad
that is what i think of you asshole nothing
i believe it
i turn it on when i confront the guy
yeah but you have not found him yet the guy took off for las vegas
the wife sues the airline this is a gutsy babe
at that point basically that has to be it
very nice
yeah i like it i am high up i can see everything you know it is the cadillac of minivans
whatta you think chill
i would not think you are that dumb leave over three hundred grand in the closet underneath the extra blanket but i guess you are
i did not know where else to keep it where would you
you are here a while that is wrong with a bank
they report it to the irs
you have been losing
i am up twelve grand today
from when you left vegas with four fifty
who told you that
now you are down to three ten in the case you must have cooled off quite a bit since you got here
how would you know i was here
it was fay was not it told you about the money she tell you my whole life history for christ s sake
i would not let her if she tried why i am here leo basically is to save your ass
how by taking my money
you can keep what you won today that is yours
it is all mine
you take all my money but you are borrowing part of it
but you will not know where i am i do not even know where i will be
it is not one of these
you see a black leather jacket fingertip length like the one pacino wore in serpico you do not you owe me three seventy nine
mr barboni is a good customer works for jimmy capp
the door from the patio in back
you broke in
no it was open it was not locked
well basically this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand plus he is a few weeks behind on the vig the interest you have to pay
the interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand
that is right three percent
hey karen how ya doin
what are you doing here
i wanted to come by apologize for coming into your house like i did last night
lemme get this straight you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before
no no you left the patio door open you gotta stop doing that all the nice things you got around here
yeah well make sure you lock it on the way out
rough day on the set
i spent all day crawling out of a grave the costumer kept bitching cause i was ripping my nylons –
ripped nylons work makes the shot more real
that is what we finally decided
yeah that was a good scene i mean for a horror movie
how come you stopped making movies with harry
i married martin that was a full time job
you read harry s new one he says it is the best thing he is ever read
he must mean after slime creature 3
harry told me martin loves it he flipped
yeah well martin is known for his flipping he flips over a script and when the time comes to make a deal he flips out
tell you what i will stop by harry s office and pick up a copy for you
well i gotta have a talk with leo my runaway dry cleaner
right see how your story ends
you been here the whole time
i got you a copy of the script
i already read it harry left a copy at the house
i think it is not horrible
i do not like the title or the main guy s name
then you have read it
not yet
you and harry will make a great team i am gonna make a deal with him
there a part in it for you
i do not want to act in it i want to produce it with harry especially if i help him get martin
sounds fair
that why you came over here to ask me that
i want to know
why does anyone want to be in movies
this thing s actually accurate i bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on sunset
well actually martin the movie we came to talk about is mr lovejoy
a locker at the airport jesus christ harry tell me you are not really that stupid
that was martin he wants to have lunch tomorrow that is if you can make it
how would you meet martin anyway
not unlike the way nicki met him except it was a wrap party why
i do not know i am just having some trouble seeing you two together
so what about your story you thought of a title yet
how about get shorty except that is not a movie that is real life
i think you could be an actor i know you are acting sometimes but you do not show it
you thought i was faking
you do not mean a movie star more like a character actor
harry my god
what kinda food they serve at this ivy place anyway
harry what are you doing you are supposed to be in the hospital
you sure
he is doing the same thing you did to him playing letterman on tv
it is not dave it is a movie
are you going down
i do not know
you are as bad as harry
you okay
karen what the fuck are you doing
were you scared up there
you bet
you do not act like it
i will be right back
what took you so long
they are closing the granview you know theater down on biscayne
yeah the guy owes momo a few g s
you sure it was ray bones took the coat
that is what the guy said
that is the dumbest thing i ever heard where do you sleep
i told you not to –
i hate to say i told you but i did i told you do not start nothing with him that time
you said do not say nothing and i did not
no you just broke his fucking nose instead
how would he know i was in vegas you tell him
he already knew it
yeah well i am in l a now
whatta you doing out there
i am going into the movie business
what are you talking about you wanna be a movie star
i am thinking about producing
how you gonna do that you do not know shit about making movies
i do not think the producer has to do much outside of maybe knowing a writer
yeah but whose point of view
whatta you mean whose point of view the audience s point of view
all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene
yeah what three words harry
hello doris
well are not you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like
what a spectacular view
i miss murray harry
i am not sure how i feel about this doris

i doubt it who s your friend
this is your money
hey this is my office there s no smoking
help yourself
my pocketbook
that is in it
that is this
oh i would not be so sure what with all the cash i think i could go with conspiracy to traffic
let me have a word outside with agent nicolet for a moment
help us do what
but now you are telling us now you do
you do not want much do you
four thirty i am meeting a woman
that is her name
he would not say you gonna follow her
she leaves somebody will be on her
are you really a bail bondsman
i gave you my card there
can i see your i would
who put up my bond ordell
can we stop for cigarettes
sure ever been to the riverbottom
i do not think so
it is okay it is a cop hangout
could not we just stop at a seven eleven
i thought you might want a drink
i would love one but not there
we could stop at the hilton by the airport
is it dark
it is kind of a sports bar
that does not sound dark
why does it need to be dark
you gain weight
ten pounds i lose it and put it back on
that is why i do not quit if i cannot fly anymore i am gonna have a bitch of a time getting my brand
you are not tired of it
they wanted you to tell them what you know
i had em too i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down then their asses lucked out and found that coke
that would be beaumont livingston
that is him how do you know em
i wrote him on monday they found him dead on tuesday
ordell pick up his bond
same as you ten thousand
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont
you mentioned a guy from l a p would but you did not mention the federal
i did not
no you did not what branch
he is the one who wants you
i used to bring over ten thousand at a time that is the legal limit so i never brought more than that
how many trips did you make
with ten thousand nine
ask a t f they might give you permission
yeah if i cooperate
what dya think
if you are having some
you get a chance to use it
i felt a lot safer having it my milk went bad when i was in jail
thanks but i have my own now
what i could not hear you
i could not wait till i got home last night and wash my hair
you never got into the whole cd revolution
this is pretty
uh huh
who is this
74 i think
i called in sick this morning as far as the airline knows i am still available
what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you
i want to talk to them first i know more now about ordell s money
well if the a t f guy is the one who wants you that will only interest him up to a point
it is a lot of money about a half a million dollars all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more coming in
how would you find that out
he told me last night
he called you
he came by
what what would you do
he needs me without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in cabo sugar
how do you get it out
same way i been doin but first they got to let me go back to work
you are gonna offer to set him up
if i get let off otherwise fuck em
it is very possible ordell s killed somebody
how do you feel about getting old
you are not old you look great
i am asking how you feel does it bother you
okay i am a little sensitive about my hair it started falling out ten years ago so i did something about it
it is different with men
does something else worry you
i just feel like i am always starting over you said how many bonds you wrote
i walked right past you
i know ignoring me what are you up to
catching a movie
what would ya see
american president
how was it
pretty good me and annette bening are goin steady
oh are you does she know that
and annette s it for you
who was your girl before annette
sandra bullock you know her
yeah she is the girl who drove the bus in speed she is cute
i am old enough to be her father
how old s annette
what are you a bag lady
i go back to work tomorrow
you talk them into it
they seem to like the idea
bring the money in and they follow it
yea but i am going to dress it up put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here
make the delivery somewhere in the mall
right around here in the food court
will ordell go for that
i am helping him bring his money into america he loves the idea you just missed him
he was here
yeah we were going over everything that is why all the bags
you think he is got a thing for you
maybe but i am thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself
i do not follow your logic what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell s money
he is setting me up to make a proposition
i see
you do not propose something like that unless you are pretty sure the other person s into it
you know some interesting people
he were not bullshitting either cause later he was suspended and forced to retire
what about you max
what if i was in nicolet s place
no i mean you right now not it you were somebody else
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money would i take it
you know where it came from it is not like it is anybody s life savings it would not even be missed
a half a million dollars will always be missed
you are avoiding the question
a lot of reasons but the main one would be i am tired of it
when did you decide
hi i am max cherry your bail bondsman
wait a minute after we were together you went and snuck into a guy s house
got another gun and a stun gun
and went to this guy s house in el monte and i waited for him
what do you do when he comes home
shoot him with the stun gun while he is incapacitated cuff him take em to county
you do that
that is my job
and is that it
i am not sure you answered my question
which one
if you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a half million dollars would you take it
do not even think about it you could get yourself killed go to prison
the feds it is evidence
i told them ordell s changed the amount he is bringing in
do you think they bought it
oh yeah i got them thinking ordell s real nervous they love thinking he is scared of them
you know a good cop will not let you know he knows you are fulla shit
it will be more than that
do not be so literal ray believed it
but you still have to show him the money at the airport
well you know i am not going to show him the whole amount he will see fifty thousand
where is the rest of it
in the bag underneath
what if he checks it
he will not i mean he did not the last time he will be expecting fifty thousand and there it is on top
you are taking a helluva chance kid
not really if he finds it i say mr walker put the money in and i did not know nothing about it like the coke
then you are out and you get nothing
yeah but i am not in jail and i tried
you are gonna have surveillance all over you
that is why you do not make a move till i come out of the fitting room
in a dress
how would you find out
all winston had to do was ask around ordell s living in long beach with a woman junkie
ray wants him
so how do we give ordell to nicolet
get ordell to come to your office
set him up
uh huh
tell him you want to see him
i have chickened out i am afraid of him he will like that
what do you tell nicolet
ordell called and wants to meet me and i am scared
he is already there
what if he hears something he is not supposed to
i got your package it was fun getting a half a million dollars in the mail
less ten percent
only this is not a bail bond max
i hesitated taking that much
you worked for it if you are sure that is all you want
i saw ray the other day boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement
did you tell him you were leaving
i did not use you max
i did not say you did
i never lied to you
i know
we are partners
i am fifty five years old i cannot blame anybody for anything i do
i would feel a whole lot better if you took some more money
madrid or barcelona
wanna go
thanks but you have a good time
sure i cannot twist your arm
thank you for saying that but no my business
i thought you were tired of your business
i am just tired in general
who s side are you on
i beg your pardon
what if i plead guilty
and cooperate you might get probation
he say we like the same thing as married
most of the times
sometimes every day for a while
yes m
you know that is in the bag you are taking
he say is a surprise
and what would this be sweet and low
what the fuck is that shit
i know what it looks like
look that shit ai not mine
we will just be a minute
thanks for waiting jackie now tell me what can we do for you
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job
we can look into that
i need it tomorrow if i do not show up for work tomorrow i am fired
you know what we want
oh so now you know him
no shit you know how he makes his money
he sells guns
then how do you know he sells guns
he told me besides why else would an a t f man be after him
i am recording this
the envelope contains ten thousand dollars the subject will be delivering the currency in a
ordell has a white guy working for him named louis
you talk to him
not really
his full name is louis gara he just got out from serving four years in susanville
what for
bank robbery do you know what he does for ordell
i imagine shit needs to be done
compton with a fifty six year old petty thief woman named simone hawkins
ever meet her or they talk about her
not yet
who s the other one
white girl named melanie ralston another girlfriend of ordell s
and splitting with her
i am sure that was the idea
what did you say
i smiled and walked away she also told me ordell killed beaumont
she told you that
uh huh
was she there
she did not say
but she mentioned beaumont by name
uh huh
well this sounds like a lady i would like to have a word with so everything s set for tomorrow
you said that the last time
well it is true is not it after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else what do you think
we could if i am not in jail
that is fifty thousand huh it does not look like that much
i was told ten thousand in each pack
you did not count it
ever been tempted
what to put one of these in my pocket
yes all those things are true
after all it do not belong to nobody right
i thought i did
but you did not do that
you took the time to pay the saleswoman
i had to i was frantic i did not know what to do
there was a guy with melanie
this guy with melanie that was louis gara
i did not see him i was in my underwear if it was a white guy it was probably louis he kill melanie
it is possible you are saying you do not have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand
i have no idea
you would take a polygraph on it
if it will make you happy
louis gara s dead l a p would found him dead in a car on ninth and we have lost ordell
what about me
what about you
oh hi

this is indiana nothing s going to happen to you
a wife did someone piss drunk run into your wife crushed her like a bug snapped her bones

what are the odds do i have a fifty fifty chance of surviving the operation
i mean why the sudden voluntary visit usually it takes gun point to get you in here
routine i assure you i just wanted to gage my health am i healthy
yes you are
i know what you are getting at
you do
i have seen it before
you should start slow and easy fifteen minutes a day
you thought i sent them
have i forgotten something is this a special day
the new store
honey i told you if it makes you happy we should just do it
it is a tremendous amount of work moving
love is shown through actions not just words
that is that that is not a fortune you will be rich that is a fortune what you have is a statement
what it is is the truth
is this going to be similar to the flower incident
sometimes people need to see things done for them because sooner or later they do not believe the words anymore
why do you polish that thing all the time
you are talking to me
a book society award is a very prestigious thing
then why
i do love you very very much
show me
walk with me
you like to take walks
it is one of those thoughts you keep to yourself
i thought we both wanted the same things
i have changed my mind
i want children
ellen there are two kinds of people in the world
you can change
face it ellen i am not the type of person who reads bedtime stories but you love me anyway
it must have hit the window i think its neck is broken
it is not going to make it ellen let the poor thing go quietly
your father
he is plastered
i do not know
i think it is a different place for each person
if i die you will know where to look for me
go to sleep ellen
what did they ask
if i had seen you by the way i am sorry about your wife they told me
thank you i am sorry you had to lie it must have been difficult
to where
pacifica california
from where
philadelphia pennsylvania
do you believe a person s soul lives on after their death
most certainly
and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them
that is a reasonable assumption
i do not want my wife s soul having any doubts
doubts about what
that is his story
his name is maurice he is dancing around everything else
red flags man
not our problem
why so vague why so evasive he could be somebody hot
not our problem
it is going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the steadman s house
this guy s not a murderer
a marriage certificate who the hell carries their marriage certificate around
hansen s whipped has to call his wife every two hours or she will go ballistic when he gets home
i am going to drop off tandy at the station and then drop you back
shit he jumped
jumped where
well hello

i thought you were asleep
your parents would want you to be in bed
you tell stories
you know what maybe i ran onto the field and hit a home run
each inch represents 150 miles
three thousand miles how many times does twenty go into three thousand

this is another victory my friends what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress
you go to lady now
my generosity is not so large as that
what do you want with me
your love
your words sting more sharply than your whip
i speak of love and you think only of the lash
you are cruel your heartless jesting worse than torture how can you speak of love when you see what i am
i like well what i see it pleases me
but i am hideous
you are magnificent
you lie you wish to humiliate me as if the form i am forced to bear were not punishment enough
god protect me
not from me surely
you you are a beast
we are all of us beasts my dear only most are afraid to show it
and you are you not also afraid
i am afraid of nothing
then why hide behind a mask you are ashamed
like some vile toadstool
i prefer to think more like the sagacious owl
do you feed on mice and rats
i prefer a plump capon but will happily serve you rats if they are to your liking
why have you brought me here
to be my bride of course
damn you
when the time s come you will not need to jump i will throw you out myself
do it now
your moans seem almost pleasurable my dear developing a taste for the lash
kill me i want so nice
sweet princess you begin to sound most reasonable
what do you want from me
we will get you cleaned up find a suitable gown i imagine you will enjoy a good meal
oh yes
a few day s nourishment will see your strength returning
what will become of me then
when you are ripe for my pleasure i will enjoy the harvest
i see
i am pleased you are not troubled by the prospect
do as you wish with my body you will never possess my soul
your soul why should i bother with such a paltry trifle
you are a beast
what was that did you hear that
it is nothing my men take great delight in routing the enemy do not trouble yourself beauty
it sounded like it came from the courtyard
from the parapets most likely the men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving
might we watch too
and i with you i never dreamed life held such pleasures
and now
now i want to live forever i have never felt so strong or happy
or looked so beautiful

i am in no mood for dancing
oh but you will be jack think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a dancing
faerie ring
no tis not the time i want no part of your frolic
no i i need to rest
you will have a long long rest in the tomb me lad
i meant no disrespect
did not you now well then answer me this riddle and all be forgiven
and if i cannot
damnation codfish and cockles gammon and trotters you have bested me jack
a riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you are thirsty for wine
you be our guest jack
i am honored honeythorn gump but no more tricks
you have me word lad to answer a faerie riddle deserves as much
twas the princess lili gave me the answer have you seen her by chance
i have laid eyes on no mortal but you this day jack
i fear she is lost
elderberry wine no finer drink under heaven
well i i do not want to be rude but it is generally known that
generally known what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots
please do not misunderstand i am grateful for your hospitality and
but but why
big question that lad why what
why has this happened to the world why is it winter now and dark
aye honeythorn gump would be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer
do not you know
that much magic i can offer ye a small measure of entertainment at best making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers
then that is gone wrong why did it happen
if ye want more tricks i am your man but for big questions ye must go elsewhere
there must be an answer somewhere
true but it will not come easy or free if ye want to ask ask jenny greenteeth
will you lead me to her
are we here
aye that foul wallow be where jenny greenteeth dwells oona lure her out play the part of a girl child
what do i do
and if she thinks me a liar
the princess is dead
lamentable news jack but tis the fate of the living concerns us now
did you hear twas the killing of the unicorn caused it
aye black baron s mischief
if the horn be restored the curse is ended
time for a champion can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird s nests jack
i will do what i have to do for princess lili s sake
bravely spoke you have the heart of a champion true enough
twill take more than heart where do we find the armor of achilles for a start
there it be lad the lindfarne mound kings long forgotten lie there lost in their final sleep
have we turned grave robber then
a tomb it once was boy and a tomb it may yet be there s another in residence at lindfarne now
and who might that be
better pray the worm s a sound sleeper jack
you do the praying i have work ahead
there s the spirit lad if ye run into trouble give a yank here and we will haul ye up
there be no finer victuals than worm flesh lad
by the grace of god
what is it
pregnant is she
damn them
do not see why i cannot ride too i am second in command damn it
the colt s still too small
i am small and i can make myself smaller still small as a bee small as dust want to see me do it
save your mischief for the black baron
aye that too
you will need more than bird droppings for blackheart
i will drop a cow on the knave
fine looking army
we march on castle couer de noir within the hour
how do you plan on finding this here castle if ye do not mind me asking
a true and troubling question gump we will start from where the unicorn was killed the baron must have left a trail
track the demon to his lair
we must follow that bird
whatever for
jenny greenteeth said follow the raven in her flight
aye said to follow it to the edge of night but is this the right bird
i am sure it spoke to me
how do we follow a raven we cannot even see
send oona up above the tree tops she be our eyes
aye he is enchanted the lot of them his reward for delivering the unicorn
foul fellow this couer de noir
the foulest mayhap i can cut them free
worse than the battlefield
there it seems to quit i will wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing
well if the knight be already dead what harm is there in borrowing a thing or two
oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance
twould appear other travelers precede us
nay jack tis not what you are thinking
and this some of their handiwork
nay that is but to distract the casual visitor a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly
nice piece of work
my god look
something the matter
shhh not so loud mayhap he will hear ye
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet
certainly understandable
i should hope not
i pray always to be worthy of it
we are not in a tournament gump ah but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons
tis not the sword that counts but the man what swings it rest easy jack
god protect you honeythorn gump
this rate we will all be in our graves fore we reach the baron s fortress
we will surely be in our graves if we do not
god s blessing
what make ye of that jack
archers bring down that spider i will deal with this other creature
is she dead
no thank the lord but she be sore envenomed by the spider s bite
we are blind now oona was our eyes and ears how do we find the castle couer de noir without her
we will find it
easily said the raven passed this way hours ago
heading true north we continue in that direction
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course
we will trust in faith gump
why not admit it honeythorn gump we have lost our way entirely
long as we do not lose heart jack
we will never find the baron s castle
wait jack
hold jack do not strike
nay i show no pity to imps and fiends
aye we be on a quest to set the world aright
can we trust him
never felt so cold in all me born days
do not like the feel of it jack
give in to despair and all is lost
it feels wrong jack like a trap
there s more than one way to spring a trap
that be so better you pinch yourself now jack
on the morrow i will be awake enough to see if dreams come true
tells you something about him what lives there
we will need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders
why not mine the damned walls
a fine mess this is horrid nipping creatures what do we now jack
defend ourselves we have bested far worse already
easily spoken
do not loose heart assemble the archers have everyone not holding a shield man a bow shoot the damned things as they fly
there are not enough arrows
water does not burn
and frog do not fly and bite like tomcats it be magic jack powerful ogre s magic
there is not much time
been telling you that all along lad
what magic have we on our side
will you chance a miss
one more turn
have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory
aye before the wee pesties attacked
then it is godspeed screwball
he will be atop the portculis ere long
best get down close to the moat lad
aye we are good as inside
it does not matter
nonsense course it matters
she is sore hurt jack tis true but not dead yet
the wound is mortal
nay you have not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine
can you save her
easily the question is can we save ourselves be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war
i do not understand
the baron hides in the dark in a passage under the castle quick give me the dwarf s key the one which opens any lock
in the dark lad why should he do that
because sunlight will kill him quickly now give me the key
sunlight you say
aye hurry now gump the key
mean you to seek him out below
i am not afraid of the dark
the kitchen be the most important room in a palace for if the victuals ai not right little else is likely to be so
did you bring me here to sup
nay lad we are here to collect a weapon you will need fighting the baron
plan on carrying some away in a kettle
will you explain that is going on
hey stop it i cannot see
cannot we move any faster
seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead
do not get too far
he is getting away he was at my mercy
never show mercy
ride like wild fire jack
he will not escape me
a good day for singing
i have not heard a note out of you
not in the mood i am afraid
listen to him not in the mood
on a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen a day so fair as forty springtimes
i am not denying it is a joyous day
where is your joy if you cannot sing
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst
she lives is not that worth singing about
the quest s at an end and where is the good of it a faerie festival over a pile of bones
tis not the wound that is sure not a scar remains we are talking about a spell harder to repair than sword work
i will do anything face any challenge
might not need a gesture quite so grand what were you doing the very moment the baron s curse fell on the world
by the pond she was teasing me
go on go on
she tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it said she would marry me if i did
and did you
nay it was lost when i came up for air the pond was frozen over
you must find the ring it completes the cycle answers the riddle
i will try
keep me belly full jack kill us another worm
hush up screwball do your own worm sticking if you like the taste so well
well done lad stout heart
barely living from the looks of it
you see you see
ogg lives there and thurgis
we seek to undo the curse
well done lad
look at that shot three at once i cannot miss
sweet slippers of oisin
someone like floki or squarefoot or
aye my lord
start acting like you are worthy of this mission here whatever you do do not dare drop it
nay sire i will cling to it as to life itself
how are these
greetings my lady the green wood is honored
these for me
but you did you did
it is my father gone a hunting the baron couer de noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport
sport indeed
the baron is a frightful man they say he is an ogre he wears a mask so none may see his face
blackheart aptly named
a promise is a sacred oath
let s rest a minute i am so thirsty
stop complaining
a gentleman would offer water
only were he a fool to boot see yon viper
i detest serpents
that viper has envenomed the water no animal will drink here now
what shall we do
oh dear
that is the matter
i have lost my napkin it was all elf work and lace i must have dropped it when you startled me so
i will go search for it
do not leave me now i fear the unicorn will not show himself without you
i am not its master
the napkin will keep i would rather not be alone
i am a princess you have no right to order me about
such grace and their smell it is ambrosia
they rival the angels of paradise
oh jack might not i touch one it would thrill me so
tis a fair question if you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap
he will not flee if i show myself
not if you be chaste tis an awesome test of virginity
i have no fear of failure your implications are most unbecoming
where are you going
what happened
my father and the baron
damned hunters it was a trap and you were the bait
i did not know i did not it was so lovely he was in my lap like like a baby and i
they tricked you
my own father
how bad was the unicorn s wound
it happened so fast he was hurt and ran away
he did run
oh yes and the mare with him
there are many would pay a king s ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood
i do not want it on me
its powers are strong
i do not want to be reminded of what happened
not even the birds sing sweet as you
jack green jack you must not flatter me so
tis the truth
a maid must beware of flattery methinks you want to kiss me
there s no happier thought under heaven
if i were your bride would the kissing ever stop do you wish to marry me jack
my lady mocks me
nay jack i am but wary of your intentions
my heart intends no more than that you love me as i do you
i am afraid it may storm
let it have not you a cozy bower we might hide in
tis not fit for a princess
be it fit for your wife green jack
i have no wife
then perchance you will me
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride

well spoke boy you have discerning taste for one so young just who might you be
they call me green jack ma am
come closer then jack that i might give you proper thanks

the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you
the moon is too round of face methinks
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross all the heavenly angels must envy your grace
a unicorn s been slain the last stallion in all the country
here be the death weapon the unicorn s blood dry upon it
couer de noir a demon if the devil ever made one
where do i find the baron s castle
follow the raven in her flight follow old black wing to the edge of night
not very precise directions
come sit beside me sweet boy and i will draw you a map
nay tempting as your invitation be tell me one thing more
ask away sweet man
what became of the princess
princess i know of no princess
princess lili godwin s daughter she was with me when calamity struck but after i could find no trace of her

and sweet
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind
nay oona tis not possible
a faerie s love makes anything possible
i am promised to another
oona do not cry please you must not
why should i feel such pain should be the other way round i could vex you make you dance your life away
and as barren of love as stone
i would build a wall around me with such stone so the likes of you might never enter

besides wanting to be my lawyer you also want to handle my investments too
yes that is to say—
well outside of your regular fee how much extra will it cost

yes but that is an added service a firm like cedar cedar cedar and budington usually donates
i mean about the power of attorney

a lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate tell him to see me at my office
he is capable of causing you a lot of trouble mr deeds

her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner first time in a long time she is been willing
better make yourself comfortable we got a three hour drive here
i am fine
you are the shrink are not you
no not really
but you do therapy
what an asshole
ernest what do you think
thank you

you do seem much more disposed toward him than i understand ernest did i miss something
phyllis i am sorry i did not mean to shout
dr delbanco it is nice to see you again
i do not think you know dr sheeler she is the other therapist here in town
what are you doing for lunch
i have run on forgive me we are here to talk about you
my mentor was an amazing teacher named benton mandlebaum died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo
interesting approach what was his name
we are interested in any new therapies how would you characterize your approach
i see
and please for whatever small way i may have encouraged this accept my apologies there is good news though
that is that
phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city which leaves you the only psychologist in town
dr sheeler is leaving mumford i am sorry to hear that
i have eighteen more minutes
i do not want to hear any more today
why not
mr follett do you trust me or do not you
well i do not know i only been seeing you
without trust there s no point to any of this you might as well not come
now hold on i did not say i did not want to come
or maybe it was not an accident at all
mr follett
stop now
why i am paying for this
not for this not me you are not
you find it distasteful do not you
it does not matter how i feel about it it is how you feel about it that matters
i enjoy it does that make me some kind of pervert just because a man has a rich imaginative life
you came because it is taking over you are in its grip
where is your wife henry
go to hell
i was never satisfied
that is that
what is it
it is a thought i had
let me just say something here i have no idea if this is going to help
what exactly is it supposed to do
you remember when i asked you about pornography
i find it degrading maximum gynecology and minimum turn on
and you told me that still there s some kind of imagery that is haunting you and i think getting in your way
which i do not necessarily agree
whoa whoa what are you doing i want to know that is in here
uh sorry i am going to have to i really appreciate what you are trying to uh i cannot thank you enough for
i feel like we are making real progress here
i did not see you there can i help you

no thanks plenty of time for that when we are a little further along
what brought this on
you must be dr mumford of mumford jeremy brockett
doc nice to meet you
are you a man who likes to treat himself right
i have had my moments
i am and i am not ashamed of it nobody ever said on their death bed i treated myself too well
i thought it was nobody ever said i should have spent more time at the office
fill in the blank i do not mind the office the point is you only go round once like the zens say be here now

what do you think s wrong with her
you are the doctor what do you think
clarence norman white do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged
i do
people who have come to you with the faith that you know what you are doing and that you are who you say you are
i am sorry you are frustrated
are you disrespecting this court mr white
so is this like a japanese restaurant
i would better get in there
that is a lot of people all at once
it is okay they pre order there s a choice of three entrees
meat loaf turkey quesadillas or salad nicoise
salad nicoise i love salad nicoise
you are early it is not ready what happened
my patient had to leave early
does the phrase nosy have any meaning to you lily
i think it is like inquisitive
it was henry follett
man you see him a lot and it is very wrong to reveal it next you will be saying what his problem is
what do you want to know
how long you been in this town
oh i do not know
four months two and a half weeks that is how long and you have already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined
so what makes you so popular that is your secret
you like me how come

do we run into the street no i did not think so nice car how is that place
and the brocketts

they come through a few times each year hello mrs saito good to see you again it is a tour
where am i supposed to eat
lily i want you to meet skip skip lily
so rich
i do not want you to be mad at skip
he told you
skip and i would not have got together if it were not for you that is a big deal
you would have met in some shower eventually
i want to give you something will you let me
thanks lily i do not need anything
here it is some advice do the hard thing
that is it that is what you are giving me
what it might take is doing time
but it is not really my school and this is very interesting it is the school from the next district
you crazy you cannot do this
sure i can lionel
do not you at least have a back door i can use
maybe some of us do not need this crap
hello lionel
you have got to have the right ladder for the job you do not know what you are doing you can get yourself in trouble
it is a country club do not worry about it
got a license but no car
do not need it
i just got my license two weeks ago
you are good
i been driving since i was twelve
that would explain it
can you help mom
i am trying
that is wrong with her
how are you
hello mother i want you to meet dr mumford
that is happening here
we are going for a walk
do you think that is a good idea
dr mumford does yes i have put myself completely in his hands for today anyway
it will never happen you are in big trouble mister
ph would psychologist
oh not a real doctor
what would you want
finally some common sense
what do you mean
i think you know what i mean
no i really do not
i think you do
why do not you tell me
well you see the problem is
wow you are something
well look who s here
good evening mrs cook
just who is here can you tell me
could i see sofie please
sofie it is so obvious you are after my daughter
feel free to lie down most people do
that is okay maybe it is my mother always says everything that is wrong with you is in your head i suppose that is true
hmm is that a professional opinion
hmm as in that is interesting sometimes with enough clues it is possible to figure these things out
what would you do
we we would try several things but i need to see you a lot
i do not know i barely made it today
we will take it slow you will never feel you cannot handle it
i do not think i can afford it i do not want my dad paying
you have the best answer for everything you seem so hopeful are you always this sunny
no one ever thought so you must bring it out
is it contagious cause everyone agrees my immune system s way down
i am not making any promises
we will turn back anytime you want
mom s such a cutie
maybe but you are the one whose ass is dragging
is that the technical description of what i have got
is she against you getting help
we do not discuss it
okay then are you positive your mother s a bitch just kidding
you have got a funny idea of funny
is this the treatment
sorry i am done
i am embarrassed the list is so long
sore throat
painful lymph glands forget fulness irritability depression
yes yes and definitely yes also i get confused
i do not know if i mentioned the headaches
did you get headaches before this but you get more now or more severe
no not really they are about the same my marriage was one long headache
i can give myself a headache instantly
there i have given myself a real whopper
you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage
sometimes yeah pulling in two different directions at once it makes tiny little tears in our fabric
you are doing great
i do not know if i am going to make it the whole way
who thinks there s nothing really wrong with me
and i will bet you can interpret the whole thing
is that when you split up
so whose route is this
brady peck s fourteen years old lives next door
and he is where
in the capitol for boy s nation five days why
i am thinking a gal could make a good living doing this how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old
you like it
it is all right
then you can expect me at 5 30 tomorrow morning
and this is legitimate therapy
that is what i like
which thing
either one
why would you come to the house the other night
i thought i had something to tell you but it turned out i did not
my brother said you were about to fire me
that is one way to put it
i bet i know what changed your mind my mother she was so horrible you decided you could not desert me
i need to talk to you doctor can i come in
it might have been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor patient relationship
is something wrong sofie
yes something s very wrong dr mumford
you are upset
is it something you have heard about me
no it is not something i have heard about you it is someth why is there something i should have heard about you
i am glad
given that i am obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way
i do not follow you
the point is this i am not a blank page i did not just fall off the turnip truck do you know what i mean
i guess you saw the show
part of it we were watching er until someone called
how violated i feel
you feel violated
not me all my other my patients i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here
but nothing i am mad as hell this is a terrible thing you have done
will you think about it
i do not know depends i am in a bad mood
but first you have to tell me something
anything just ask
you got off easy
will you wait for me
we are only talking about six weeks
will you be here
what do you mean in no time
in maybe three or four issues
weekly or monthly
monthly god how shallow do you think brad is why do i waste my time telling you this stuff
why do you think you tell me nessa
do not do that thing that shrink thing
the school board does not pay you what kind of deal is that
it is called pro bono
pro boner pro bono huh for whose good supposedly
it is my bit for the community
fuck the community there was this article my friends and i read it was 25 signs he is great in bed it was very fascinating
you been spying on me in the supermarket nessa
is not she amazing that is such a wicked look
what do you want me to see
what are you doing we are not done i just need to find the thing
what happened today
what are you talking about
was it something that happened at school
these appointments were not my idea remember
i do not think you know what you are talking about
uh huh
what would he say
what did he want you to do
what balls on this guy what are we going steady jesus
you are doc mumford skip skipperton
how are you
would you like another beer
nah scotch
can i ask you a personal question
of course that is exactly what i want
is that the question
i understand
i have a lot of money do you know how much money i have got
do not tell me cause i am not going to tell you what i have got
i have got three big ones
i am impressed i could not make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes
this is great
this is exactly what i wanted
skip you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with
you would be surprised most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends they are busy it is not as easy as you think
so would you say we are out here let me think how to put this is your problem really that you are lonely
do not you like this
hell yes i like it that is better than this most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like
okay then have you got a lot of friends
lily and i talk a bit you know lily runs the coffee shop
no i have seen her good looking woman
she is probably ten years older than you
good looking woman
lives downstairs from me she is got a great dog named for danny ainge
really i am the only person i know that likes danny ainge outside of celtic fans maybe phoenix
unbelievable and lily named her dog after him far out
so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours he is my pharmacist
pretty good too lots of detail nothing hard core old fashioned ones from back when people cared about atmosphere and character
hey skip
doc i know we are not supposed to get together till wednesday
sometimes it is best to keep a few things just for ourselves
you are a shrink doc are not i supposed to be able to tell you everything
yeah well what i was gonna tell you
guess go ahead guess
slash what
sexual surrogate slash companion
how is it coming
you do not think i am insane
and that is your secret you meant like a trade secret
no doc a private secret it is perverted it is pitiful what am i dr frankenstein are not you repulsed
skip that is not much of a secret
who else knows
just you
damn what is your name
does not matter you can call me doc
i have told you a lot of private stuff
i can tell you anything else
but there was one job that looked like it might be fun investigator
an investigator for the internal revenue service
everybody has a story skip
an irs investigator with a drug problem
it was not the best situation
of course him being insane did not make it all right that i fell in love with his wife
get to know your therapist
you were messed up man
but look at me now
at least you pulled yourself out
things got a lot worse
somebody s taking a shower down there
who would you go with that is not good
i know it starts with a birth certificate
what about it
and a birth certificate is enough
but you studied psychology right you did the training and just never got the degree
no no training
psych major
english lit
jeez man but you are good at it
where ya going i have got a million questions
i have never brought anyone down here before
skip i have got a problem and i need some advice
pretty creepy huh are you totally disgusted
skip you are a visionary that can be a burden
this does not seem a little perverse
there are a lot of lonely people in the world somebody s gonna figure this out someday
it is all your fault in the last 48 hours i have completely lost interest
i am here for you doc
skip you know that it is improper completely unethical for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients
i guess that makes sense
it is possible i do not know about that

which examiner did you have i probably know him

captain this is the garden spot of ceti alpha vi
you are crazy
i saw it
botany bay oh no
but the child
a criminal captain a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering
he left us we were no longer of use saavik where is the reliant crew dead
beyond what i told you sir it is classified information
umm and would admiral kirk have access to such information
i would think so sir he is on the fleet general staff
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis
to doctor marcus the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i
well done commander
i am admiral kirk
where is dr marcus
why did not you tell me
it is a long story
he is on a build up to detonation
how soon
we encoded four minutes
we will beam aboard and stop it
i do not mean to intrude
uh no i should be on the bridge
i suppose i was i poured a drink would you like it
no i i guess i am not what you expected
i did not expect anything
you knew enough to tell saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life
it was just words
but good words that is where ideas begin maybe you should listen to them
i am trying david
so am i my friends were killed too
i was wrong about you and i am sorry
is that what you came here to say
let go he cannot
what are you looking at
the admiral s son
do not you believe it
what are you looking at
they are requesting visual communications sir
let them eat static
careful not all at once the engine room lock on target and prepare to fire
sir our shields are dropping
they will not
at them at them fire fire why cannot you
we will lose them if they go in there
no sir we have genesis whatever you want
yours is the superior
you still remember admiral i cannot help but be touched of course i remember you
but i wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you i khan noonian singh the eagle you attempted to cage forever
khan listen to me if its me you want i will have myself beamed aboard all i ask is that you spare my crew
genesis that is that
do not play with me kirk my hand is on the phaser control
give me some time to recall the data on our computers
khan how do i know you will keep your word
i have given you no word to keep admiral in my judgment you simply have no alternative
time s up admiral
kirk kirk you are still alive my old friend
still old friend you have managed to kill just about everyone else but like a poor marksman you keep missing the target
i do not know you but you i never forget a face mister chekov is not it i never thought to see your face again
captain we are waiting that is the delay
all is well sir you have the coordinates to beam up genesis
aye sir
we will be going to warp speed
scotty that is left
just the batteries sir i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes
we do not have minutes can you give me phaser power
just barely sir
i will need ten minutes sir until the radiation dissipates
uhura cannot you augment
she is not responding
try the emergency channels
enterprise to reliant come in reliant
mr scott on discrete
no response sir
saavik for god s sake tell her we are all right
enterprise to reliant you are ordered to surrender your vessel respond nothing sir
mr scott you old space dog you are well
i had me a wee bout but dr mccoy pulled me through
midshipman you are a tiger
my sister s youngest admiral crazy to get to space
every young boy s fancy i seem to remember it myself very well mr scott are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise
give the word admiral
mr scott the word is given
the energizer s bypassed like a christmas tree so do not give me too many bumps
no sir you will flood the whole compartment
if he had not we would be space by now
yes spock
engine room reports auxiliary power restored we can proceed at impulse power
kirk to enterprise damage report spock
admiral if we go by the book like lieutenant saavik hours could seem like days
meaning you cannot even beam us back
spock this is kirk it is two hours are you about ready
and who is this
your first training voyage mr preston
yes sir
is the word given
i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets
it had the virtue of never having been tried
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality
so you said at the time speaking of which your prot‚g‚ s first rare a trifle emotional
she is half romulan jim the admixture makes her more volatile than me for example
i know of your fondness for antiques
it was the best of times it was the worst of times message spock
hrummm and where are you off to now
permission to come aboard captain
welcome aboard admiral i believe you know my trainee crew certainly they have come to know you
there s a first time for everything admiral
something may be wrong at regula i we have been ordered to investigate
like all living beings admiral each according to his gifts the ship is yours
but it may be nothing garbled communications why do not you
will you accompany me to the bridge
there are two possibilities sir they are unwilling to respond they are unable to respond
how far
twelve hours and forty three minutes present speed
give up genesis she said what in god s name does that mean give it up to whom
it literally is genesis
the power of creation
have they proceeded with their experiments
gentlemen this is not
that is she doing here
is it possible their comm system has failed
their coil emissions are normal wait their shields are going up they are locking phasers
they knew just where to hit us
who who knew just where to hit us and why
one thing is certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power
visual mr sulu divert everything to the phasers
not enough against their shields
the prefix code
you have got to learn why things work on a starship it is coming through now khan
let s hope he has not changed the combination he is quite intelligent
scanners and sensors still inoperative there s no way to tell that is inside the station
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area
affirmative admiral
blind as a tiberian bat what do you make of the plantoid beyond
regula is class would it consists of various remarkable ores essentially a great rock in space
reliant could be hiding behind that rock
a distinct possibility
all right join the party mr spock the ship is yours
aye sir
establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you have talked with mr scott
what is working around here
not much admiral we have partial main power
that is it
uh oh
she can out run us and out gun us but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four
i think we can guarantee she will follow us mr saavik remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego
estimating nebula penetration in two minutes reliant is closing
admiral they are reducing speed
sporadic energy readings port side aft could be an impulse turn
he will not break off now if he followed me this far he will be back but from where
the good of the few
kirk here
i have an urgent commpic from space lab regula i for the admiral dr carol marcus
in my quarters uhura
uhura that is happening damn it
transmission jammed at the source sir
sir we will not leave you behind
any suggestions admiral
well mr saavik are you going to stay with the sinking ship
permission to speak candidly sir
very well
i do not believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities
and why not
because there was no way to win
a no win situation is a possibility every commander may face has that never occurred to you
no sir it has not
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life would not you say
as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me
lieutenant are you wearing your hair differently
may i speak sir
lieutenant self expression does not seem to be one of your problems
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
you earned it
i did not think so
you are bothered by your performance on the kobayashi maru
i failed to resolve the situation
there is no correct resolution it is a test of character
may i ask how you dealt with the test
that was a little joke
humor that is a difficult concept it is not logical
this is damned peculiar yellow alert
on screen
begging the admiral s pardon general order 15 no flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort
indeterminate life signs
it does not make sense these coordinates are well within regula a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless
if stage two was completed it was underground she said it was going to be underground
that is on your mind lieutenant
are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now lieutenant
i changed the conditions of the test i received a commendation for original thinking i do not like to lose
but the damage report we were immobilized
regulation 46 a if transmissions are being monitored during battle
that was close
hold your course look sharp
mr saavik all stop
all stop sir
cease fire look sharp
power levels quite low sir
saavik get us out best speed
time from my mark
two minutes ten seconds
three minutes thirty seconds
after you dismiss the company you will take the watch set course for ceti alpha v and we will pick up survivors
aye sir
i will be in my quarters if needed but i would prefer
understood sir
admiral on the bridge
as you were mr saavik
aye sir on course to ceti alpha all is well
yes well why do not you show him around and
i really must thank you
i am delighted any chance to go aboard enterprise however briefly is always an excuse for nostalgia
i cut your new orders personally by the end of the month you will have your first command uss excelsior
stop engines
course plotted for regula i admiral
mr sulu the shields
mr sulu lock phasers on target and await my command
approaching regula and space lab regula i
admiral on the bridge
phaser lock inoperative sir
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
may i remind the captain that if a starship enters the zone
i am aware of my responsibilities mister
shields activated
we are over our heads mr sulu get us out of here
aft thrusters mr sulu
we are clear and free to navigate
prepare for warp speed
we commend the soul of our brother departed we love we commit his body to the depths of space
fire all phasers
he is not what i expected sir
what did you expect lieutenant
very well mr saavik clear all moorings
all moorings are clear captain
lieutenant how many times have you piloted a starship out of spacedock
take her out mr saavik
sir may i quote general order 12 on the approach of any vessel when communications have not been est
lieutenant the admiral is aware of the regulations
you lied
the one who lives in the white house across the bay
that is the one cathy brenner
they seemed sure it was either alice or lois
are you a friend of mitch s
no just a few hours
you are leaving after you see cathy
well something like that i am sorry i do not mean to sound so mysterious
mmm well good luck miss daniels
oh hi did you find her all right
that sign do you think i could have the room for a single night
well i would really hope to rent it for
i would appreciate it i have tried everywhere in town and they are all full
it is utilitarian i will say that for it
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store you see i had not planned on spending much time here
hi is something wrong is that cut beginning to bother you
no it is not the cut that is bothering me
would you like some brandy
if you have some i would
no thank you will not you call me melanie
thank you
or would you rather i changed the subject
i think so
how do you like our little hamlet
where are you from originally annie
san francisco
how would you happen to come here
i guess you knew that anyway
i suspected as much
you need not worry it is over and done with a long time ago
annie there s nothing between mitch and me
is not there maybe there is not maybe there s never anything between mitch and any girl
when was this
with lydia did she seem a trifle distant
a trifle
then maybe it is not different at all you know her attitude nearly drove me crazy i simply could not understand it
when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what i would done to displease her
then why did she object to you
because she was afraid
afraid you would take mitch
afraid i would give mitch
i do not understand
afraid of any woman who would give mitch the only thing lydia can give him love
annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman
no i do not think so she is not afraid of losing her son you see she is only afraid of being abandoned
someone ought to tell her she would be gaining a daughter
she already has a daughter
then what are you doing here in bodega bay
you get straight to the point do not you
he wants me to go to cathy s party tomorrow afternoon i said i would
i will be going too to help out it should be fun melanie
do you think i should go
that is up to you
it is really up to lydia is not it
he got a call from dan fawcett a little while ago his chickens will not eat either
it is what you said mom mr brinkmeyer s feed is no good
well mom he is the first to admit it he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice
yes i did
mom they are in a cage
they have not harmed anyone
they are beautiful they are just what i wanted is there a man and a woman i cannot tell which is which
i still do not understand how you knew i wanted lovebirds
is smoking fun
oh i suppose so
could i have a puff
i do not think your mother would like that
i know
are you coming to my party
i do not think so i have to get back to san francisco
do not you like us
darling of course i do
do not you like bodega bay
i guess it does get a little hectic at times
why did not annie stay for dinner
she said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back east
oh where would you want the coffee
take it into the living room would you hon
we have got an extra room upstairs and everything
yeah but she will be hitting all that traffic going back to san francisco
mitch why are they doing this the birds
i do not know honey
why are they trying to kill people
cathy get a blanket and some bandages
mitch let s turn back
mitch do do you think they will be all right in the trunk can they breath
it is alice ai not it
no it is lois
i wonder if you could help me
try my best
where does he live
right here bodega bay
yes but where
and the white house
that is where the brenners live
the brenners mr and mrs brenner
nope just lydia and the two kids
the two kids
yep mitch and the little girl
i see how do i get down there
follow the road straight through town until it curves off on the left that will take you right around the bay to their front door
the front door is not there a back road i can take
nope that is the road straight through town stay on your left right around the bay to the front door
where would i get a boat
down at the dock by the tides restaurant ever handled an outboard boat
of course
d you want me to order one for you
thank you
the little girl s name
are you sure
well i ai not positive if that is what you mean
thank you
yep could save yourself a lot of trouble her name s alice for sure
how much for the phone calls
i do not see what difference it makes mrs bundy crows or blackbirds if they attacked the school that is pretty serious
i did not even know there were many crows in bodega bay this time of year
what good will that do smoke s as bad as birds
deke have you got a first aid kit back there
what happened
young woman cut herself
shall i call the doctor
you cut yourself outside miss
i had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once sued me before i could bat an eyelash
i do not think miss daniels is going to sue anybody
we do not have any fog this time of year mitch
are you finished here sebastian
let me have some apple pie helen who said anything about war all i said was that some gulls
one apple pie you want more coffee
here s your pie sebastian you want it at the table
no here s fine
i thought i saw your car what are you doing in town
i had to acknowledge a delivery mother i would like you to meet

there s nothing wrong with those chickens mitch i am going to call fred brinkmeyer right now
he sold the feed to me did not he
caviat emptor mother let the buyer beware
whose side are you on
i am simply quoting the law
she is a charming girl is not she mitch
yes very
how long have you known her
i told you we met yesterday
she was selling birds
no i only led her into believing i believed she was mother it is really very complicated
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
mother where did you go to law school
forgive me i suppose i am just naturally curious about a girl like that she is very rich is not she
i suppose so her father owns a big newspaper in san francisco
you would think he could manage to keep her name out of print she is always mentioned in the columns mitch
i know mother
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer is not she
i know mother
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself
well so long as you know what you want mitch
well well is everyone all right
tell him about the party
did you you get the windows in the attic mitch
i got them all mother
when do you think they will come
i do not know
if there are larger birds mitch they will get into the house
that is a chance we have to take
maybe we ought to leave
i do not know when we will see what
where will we go
i do not know yet i think we will be safe here let s bring that wood in
i do not know we will break up the furni
mother i am trying my best i am trying my
mother get a rope
oh my god look at her
i can handle it
i am not very good at this mitch
you are doing fine
they are gone the same pattern
but they will be back
we will not be here
where can we go mitch there s no place to go
i want to try for san francisco there are buildings there steel and concrete
we would never make it they are probably all over the road
we have to try it we cannot stay here melanie needs help mother the house will not take another attack
if if when we get to san francisco if they are already there
they will not be
if they are
we will worry about that when we get there
i started to say inside
then you knew mitch in san francisco is that right
if i go across to santa rosa i will come onto the freeway much earlier
no it is me mrs brenner i thought you might like some tea
where is mitch
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm
why did not al believe my story
he was calling from the farm mrs brenner
then he saw
he must have he sent for the santa rosa police
yes i am sure she is fine
try not to think of that mrs brenner
would you like to rest now mrs brenner
no no do not go yet i feel as if i i do not understand you and i want so much to understand
is that so important mrs brenner you liking me
yes i think so my son is important to me i want to like any girl he chooses
and if you do not
then i do not suppose it will matter much to anyone but me
why do not you try to sleep now mrs brenner
i wish i were stronger do you think she is all right do you think she is safe at the school
would you like me to go for her
i could not ask you to
i do not mind really
would you i would feel so much better
that is the last of it
did you close the door
please do not mess me up with bandages mrs brenner
that is a chimney swift all right
well these birds live in chimneys you know
not by the thousands
no i gotta admit this is peculiar did you have a light burning or something
yes but the curtains were drawn
cause sometimes birds are attracted by light you know sure is a peculiar thing
what are we going to do about it al
i do not think i get you mitch do about what
my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once
did not know how he got in there had a broken leg turned out just fluttering all around there
these birds were
oh yeah yeah how old is she now
well if there s anything else i can do mitch
thanks al we will be all right
he was killed last night by birds
there s an ordinance against burning anything in this town unless it is
he is not home
yes i do not think you should leave them in the hall do you
well where did he go
bodega bay he goes up there every weekend
bodega bay where is that
up on the coast about sixty miles north of here
sixty oh
i would hold the birds for him but i am going away myself someone s got to feed them i suppose
yes yes someone s got to feed them
lovebirds sir
yes i understand there are different varieties it that true
i understand completely sir
as the same time i would not want birds that were aloof either
no of course not
do you have a pair that are just friendly
i think so sir now then let me see
are not these lovebirds
no sir those are redbirds
the sign says strawberry finches
yes we call them that too ahhh here we are lovebirds
those are canaries miss does not this make you feel awful
does not what make me
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this
well we cannot just let them fly around the shop you know
i suppose not is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages
oh certainly it is to protect the species
i imagine that is very important especially during the moulting season
yes that is a particularly dangerous time
are they moulting now
some of them are
how can you tell
yes i see about those lovebirds miss
are you sure you would not like to see a canary instead we have some very nice canaries this week
what did you say
i was merely drawing a parallel miss daniels
but how how do you know my name
a little birdie told me good day miss daniels madam
i do not know you
we met in court
we never met in court or anyplace else
do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window
i did not break that window
no but your little prank did the judge should have put you behind bars
what are you a policeman
i simply believe in the law miss daniels and i am not too keen on practical jokers
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical
ahhh but i really do want those birds
i think you are a louse
i am good day madam
and i am glad you did not get your lovebirds
that was the damndest thing i ever saw
what made it
that is that
so you are a lawyer
that is right what are you doing in bodega bay
do you practice here
no san francisco what are you
is that why you would like to see everyone behind bars
not everyone miss daniels
i am sorry what are you doing up here
did not you see the lovebirds
you came all the way up here to bring me those birds
to bring your sister those birds you said it was her birthday besides i was coming up anyway
what for
to see a friend of mine will you please be careful
annie annie hayworth
how do you know annie
we we went to school together college
did you imagine that how long will you be staying
just a few just a day or two the weekend
i think we will have to shave the hair deke have you got a razor
oh no you do not
i do not believe you i think you came up to see me
it was no trouble at all i simply called my father s paper besides i was coming up here anyway i already told you
what did it say
cannot see a thing
i cannot say i like your seagulls much either i come all the way up here to
but you were coming up anyway remember
i was and all i get for my pains is a a a hole in the head
right next to the one you already had
after all you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds
yes but
you are are not you
certainly but
with with annie of course
of course how stupid of me a quarter to seven will that be all right
annie annie may have made other plans i will have to see besides i can find my own way
you are sure now you will not hire a boat or anything
i am sure
why did he shoot her
you will be able to find your way back will not you
oh yes
will i be seeing you again
how does mother know what i like to do
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns
oh that rome
mmmm i like to swim we might get along very
in case you are interested i was pushed into that fountain
without any clothes on
with all my clothes on the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father s paper anything they said
you were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh
i am neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd
yes but
the opinions of others and you went right along with them is not that the truth
yes that is the truth but i was pushed into that fountain and that is the truth too
sure do you really know annie hayworth
no at least i did not until i came up here
you were lying
yes i was lying
did you really write a letter to me or was that a lie too
i wrote the letter
what did it say
it said dear mr brenner i think you need those lovebirds after all they may help your personality that is what it said
because it seemed stupid and foolish
like jumping into a fountain in rome
i told you what happened in rome
do you expect me to believe
that might have been good enough in rome last summer but it is not good enough now
it is for me
but not for me
what do you want
i really should not have any more i am a little tipsy already
i am trying to get you to stay for dinner we are going to have a lot of roast left over
that is in this nitro glycerin
why do you have to rush off that is so important in san francisco
well i have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing
you have a job
i have several jobs
what do you do
i do different things on different days
like what
on mondays and wednesdays i work for the travelers aid at the airport
and on tuesdays i take a course in general semantics at berkeley that is not a job of course i just take it because
and fridays what do you do then
nothing i go to bird shops on fridays
i am glad you do
what will it say
you will think me very bold sir
last night what do you mean
a gull smashed into annie s front door mitch that is happening
i do not know melanie look do you have to go back to annie s
no i have my things in the car
do you want some mustard with this
some cream
i will take cathy up to bed
are you staying
really tell me about it
it is an uprising
of birds
growing a beard
yes of course he had to have a beard birds of the world unite he kept saying over and over
so they united
not at first oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks
well they will go along with anything
why should we submit ourselves to their domination
hear hear
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages birds of the world unite
take wing
it is so damn quiet out there
it was like that yesterday
what do you mean
after the gulls attacked
i had not thought of that and then the swifts came
it makes you feel as if they are they are waiting or resting or
melanie melanie
i am frightened mitch
no no
i got here as fast as i could where is cathy
i think it is safe to get out now
do not let s take any chances
the town looks clear
the bay does not
how long have they been gathering there
i keep thinking of annie
it it does not look very different does it a little smoke over the town but otherwise
even the birds sitting out there it does look very much the same mitch this could be last week
do you want to try your father again
i tried a little while ago the phone s dead
have we still got power
when will they stop
i thought they would have stopped by now
what time is it
almost two a m
you must be exhausted
you would have been safe in san francisco
we would better light some of those lamps
mitch if they hear the car starting if they see movement
can we turn back
hello mrs macgruder have you ever seen so many gulls
hello miss daniels
i was hoping you would be a little late miss daniels you see he has not arrived yet
well this one will not be a chick will he
certainly not oh no certainly not this will be a full grown myna bird full grown
and he will talk
i think maybe you would better deliver him let me give you my address
i am sure they are on the way though could i just call
there we are
that that who was that
have you got a pencil
they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon if you would care to come back
no you would better send him may i use your phone
yes certainly
do you have any lovebirds
no not in the shop but i can order them for you
how soon
well well how soon would you want them
immediately is this the daily news melanie daniels would you get me the city desk please
they are both perching birds of course but of quite different species the crow is brachyrhynchos the blackbird is cyanocephalus
i just came from the school madam i do not know about their brain pans but
hello may i speak to mitch brenner please yes i will wait
yes all right i will wait for you good by
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world
the gulls were after your fish mr sholes really let s be logical about this
what were the crows after at the school
what do you think they were after miss
daniels i think they were after the children
for what purpose
i do not know why
does not it seem odd that they would wait all that time to start a a war against humanity
maybe they are all protecting the species maybe they are tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and
are you discussing gamebirds now all birds are not gamebirds you know
and what vultures hawks eagles
sebastian i am not an alarmist
look mitch even if this is true even if all the birds
do you believe it is true sebastian
no i do not mitch because i cannot see any reason for it
it is happening is not that a good enough reason
i like bodega bay as well as any man if i thought
then help me sebastian you are an important man in this town if you will help the rest will
help how what do you want to do
i am not sure but
how do you plan to do that
how can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke
scotch light on the water
yeah birds all they do is make a mess of everything who needs them
we need them
not if they are starting a war
then fight back get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth
kill them all get rid of them messy animals
how many gulls did you count mrs bundy
which gulls mr sholes there are several varieties
the ones that have been raising the devil with my fishing boats
actually those gulls must have been after the fish
of course
makes a lot more sense than well an attack
i am going out that way lady you can follow me
then let s go now
i have not finished my drink
were the santa rosa police at your school today are you coming
something like this happened in santa cruz last year the town was covered with seagulls
i am leaving are you coming
you ok
i am fine
beat listen i hate to bother you
then do not
but what about starks
what about starks
should we be
should we be what trying to change him any way we can beat yes
we never should have done this to him
well your condition s pretty serious
beat so they say off becker s steady gaze what
i am just looking at you does that make you uncomfortable
you said you could not remember killing officer harrison correct
beat you do not believe me do you
he is recovering on the third floor
are you kidding me he is not psychotic
i do not know better all i know is that you left me in there
in where
we were forced to use restrains if that is what you are referring to
that was not a fucking restraint
do not act like i do not know that is real beat i am not the one that is crazy here
you are just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition
i had a patient a few years ago his name was ted casey
i do not give a shit about your patient
long live the organization for the organized
and that is that
getting away with things like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison
i will say a prayer for you in church today starks maybe the gods can pick up where the medicine left off
you sure you know where to find one
i have managed to every sunday of my life beat some of us are god fearing men starks
and what does that mean
becker how do you sleep at night
who are you
i think you know your eyes say you do
you died starks years ago in the hospital
i know beat you killed me did not you
no i did not i swear i did not i probably helped push you to kill yourself but i did not do it
i did not say i remembered killing him i just repeated some words to get myself back in there
of people like you people i was just trying to help they could not get worse so i thought with medication they might get
medication what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer
it was part of the treatment i intended i did not know what the effects would be
so what you guinea pig sick people to find out
the three of you were not regular patients you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove
i did not put you in alpine grove
do i know you from somewhere
that is right goddamn you are the spitting image i did not know he had a son
did you know my father
my father used to talk about you
look here i do not like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me
that is too bad
i thought you said you never knew your father
he died because he bled to death from a blow to his head someone had to have given him it
what should they be looking for
where beat it is becker is not it he is doing stuff is not he
you look like you have lost some weight are you eating
this is really happening is not it
beat what do you need me to do
i need to get this letter to someone
i cannot take you out of here in your condition
and i cannot stay here in my condition i am going to die tonight it is already been decided
no it has not
his body was found on january 1 1993 but do you know if that was long after he had died
no i do not i am sorry i wish i knew more
what about dr becker and mr gries
get your fucking hands off my daughter
mom he just fixed our car
come on mom do not fall asleep
you two ok
your mom take anything before this happened
yeah but i do not know what
but i like it i guess
you are just gonna walk
what are those
dog tags off her blank look they have got your name and date of birth for identification
what for
i think i can remember that is on them
what would you do snoop all over the place you had no right you had no right to go through anything
beat i know it does not make sense it does not even make sense to me
jackie i am william starks i can prove it
what now you are gonna show me some kind of driver s license
no i do not have anything to show you i am here from a mental hospital
stop it stop it jackie covers her ears and looks at him pleading with her eyes starks eyes plead right back
i am sorry for upsetting you beat but i am not lying to you
you cannot be william starks he is dead
beat what
william starks is dead beat i have been to his grave
beat what
i gave you my dog tags
no you did not they found william starks body dead in the snow
it is december 25th 1993 today
but no one knew until after
then we need to figure out what happened to you it is the only thing we can do
i did not kill officer harrison
i know
i do not believe a thing she just said
me neither who was the boy she was talking about eugene
i have no idea
you think lorenson kills you
maybe i do not know seems more likely becker does but at the very least she knows how i died
how long do we have
i do not know
what about captain medley he never told them what happened to you over there his testimony that coward wanted them to think you were crazy
you have got to get yourself out of that place they are going to kill you if you do not
me too
you are sure
they are not here
they are not
what what are you thinking
i do not know maybe that is because this whole thing is a dream how can you have a street with no cars on it
i do not know but this is not a dream i am real and so is where we are
then why is not there anyone around
of course he will beat what day of the week is it
they have got lives to be grateful for
william you are not making sense
that is all you got from him that bastard helped take your life away from you
where are we going
that is happening to me why am i getting so much weaker
when we first met when you were 7 where was the house you lived in with your mother do you remember your address
you gotta stop thinking like that
then where are you going
i have been ok
good how is your mom
i think so
how you doin
just a little when we were looking up information about william s father how did he help
he just said that i would shock eugene and then things would change for him
i do not understand
and if i did not want to come
i guess i would ask you why
because i do not think i am crazy
you were convicted of the crime
that conviction does not convince me of anything until i know that i did it i am not going to accept that i did
you may never remember at all beat your mind s grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged
why what would you do
i could try to make it stop
no i do not want it to
you should be careful you could be killed if they found you out here
my god you look exactly like him
i never knew my father did you
at the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things
what case
how would he get it
beat i do not know
well do you think dr becker would have any idea
how do you know about dr becker
it is important for you to know who your father was is not it
well beat let me know how your search turns out
you will die if you keep smoking those in your condition
what do you mean
you have no idea that is going on
no i do that is what i am saying to you
i do not know frustrated remember
come on tell me what you do know
beat i have seen a time that is not this time and i am only able to see it when i am in the jacket
ok fine tell me about it tell me about the future 2004 what does it look like
it does not look all that different
the future does not look different
no not for people like me beat not in the places i come from
what about the world
why do not you help me
because i do not have time
why not
i am about to die unless i do something to stop it
and how do you know that
because of the future i know that is going to happen
how do you know about eugene
some part of you suspects even if you do not know for sure that what i am saying is true
i do not know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions
how how do you know
you told me this was how it happened
who who kills me
you are going to be ok william we just need to get your fever down and we will be able to hopefully stabilize you
can i get some paper and something to write with
i am not gonna let that happen
you still do not believe me do you
i do believe you
william i cannot indulge these delusions even when you are in this state
i do not know when it will happen but soon i think you will shock the boy and it will wake him up
what are you talking about
you know how to get there
yeah guess so how would you know
i tried to kill my wife
do not you go to jail for that
what were you talking about the other day
i was not talking about anything
i know you need one when it is really cold
cutting in mackenzie listen to me listen i am going to die
mortality s actually a great thing to be familiar with it means you are sane on some level
gravely no i mean in four days i am supposed to die
beat how do you know
oh no you are pretty young your body will be able to handle a lot more of it than you think
cause lorenson s got her claws in it now when she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me women
geez how is that for a fucking thank you
it is worse than war it is worse than anywhere you have ever been
hey mister you need a ride
where are you going
if you are deaf read my lips i do not need a psycho following me today
in case you had not figured it is christmas eve you are never gonna get a cab here
all right beat you got somewhere you need to go mister
i am not sure
i am not sure
you do not have anywhere to stay
well where are you from
i am not sure beat i do not really know
of course you do not know
well how would you get here
beat i was dropped off
well do not you somewhere stuff belongings
great that was our last option what am i going to do with you
nothing getting up thanks for bringing me this far
where are you going you will freeze out there you do not even have a coat
that is this
i only lit it because it was so cold in here i am sorry if
so you are a waitress right i mean from the uniform you were wearing
yup that is me
you like it
beat i do it
well good for you
beat why
you do not think that is crazy
this is a great song
so you never knew your mother
i guess not but as of now i never knew either
i am sorry
i am sorry
yeah me too softly every day for the last ten years
we have been hailing the groznyy for the last hour mr secretary the groznyy refuses to stop
yes sir
and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev s ears to the top circles of my government
jesus christ guys what the hell s khruschev thinking
he is right jack taylor is saying we may have some time we have got to use it
lying bastard lied to my face
well i am not
goddamn stevenson jesus peace at any price you would think nobody learned anything from world war two
he gets it but he is pissed
we were just debating who had it worse us or george washington and his guys
how does a guy get a rep like that
who gives a shit about the midterms now the soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us
the other thing is
i will do it
jack i am as conniving as they come but a sneak attack is just wrong
what happened to speak when spoken to
rescind the order can all the chiefs put nitze gilpatric and the undersecretaries in charge
adlai s too weak we have to convince jack to pull him get mccloy in there
you cannot take him out this late in the game
zorin will eat him alive
then talk to your brother goddamn it the two of you do not need any advice to get into trouble
oh still sore about this
my father
adlai can handle zorin he knows the inning and the score
where have you been we have been trying to find you all morning
helen and i went out for breakfast excom s not supposed to convene til eight
we are getting everyone together as fast as we can
and jack wants to trade the missiles in turkey
all right so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look okay you happy so now what
so now you have got to talk him out of it and then we have got to figure out an acceptable political solution
we gave so much to get here i do not know sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for
hey mac you are up bright and early
what did you think of lippman s column this morning
then they should speak up
christ ken you know it is not that easy
every day the sun comes up says something about us
that is correct
this is from the highest authority
yes from the highest authority there are two conditions the u n must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles
and the second condition
john how much time
an invasion
is this the chiefs recommendation
how long until the army is ready
guess we cannot blame khruschev for a few patriotic farmers and the ships
still heading for cuba
i have the authority i am the commander in chief of the united states and i say when we go to war
does this attack on our plane represent a definitive intentional escalation on the part of the soviets
do not forget mrs higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about kevin you need to do something about this
what happens to you i am not leaving without you
i saw you out there you want him to call you back need you
how is my favorite president
busy but you have got his heart
i want an hour with him
i said his heart not his attention
three weeks before midterm elections you need me
well there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about
pretending there is not a problem will not fix it he can clear the air on anglo american relations
forget it scotty
it is tuesday you said to call when do i get my 45 minutes
kenny what happened they did not let me up front said the president was on the phone the whole time
why do not you ask him yourself you can have him on the way home
there are major rail disruptions in the south two airborne divisions are on alert that exercise is an invasion
well you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi
secretary of defense
dean rusk
i guess you will not be coming home tonight
get back out there kid remember to hit em hard
what about you where are you going
i was eating that
no you were not
so what have we got today
still think cuba is not important
call me irish but i do not believe in cooler heads prevailing
acheson s scenario is unacceptable and he has more experience than anyone
let s get out of here
have you canceled chicago and the rest of the weekend yet
you do not show for chicago everyone will know there s something going on
i do not care cancel it
i am not calling and canceling on daly you call and cancel on daly
you are scared to cancel on daly
you would worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support
all right cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships shots being fired across bows
i know i know
what about these low level flights they are starting in what an hour do you realize what you are letting yourself in for
that is going to be tough you know how these guys are about their chains of command
we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships but it does not get us any closer to removing those missiles
he is right we cannot rescind defcon 2 the soviets will think we have gotten sweet on them
that is that
it is a goddman trial balloon trial is the operative word here
jesus christ o donnell you are the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution
did not know adlai had it in him too bad he did not have this stuff in 52
i have got to move what do you have kenny
they know each other khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies
moving the line stroke of genius
listen to me goddamn it we are talking about a possible nuclear war you dropped the ball on bay of pigs
it is transparent the press will be all over it
bob bet you had a late night
captain force the sub to the surface for inspection
mr president we are receiving reports that the ships are stopping
captain belay that order bob where is that coming from

hardly ever maybe three times a week
constantly i would say three times a week like the other night alvy wanted to have sex
she would not sleep with me the other night you know it is
and i do not know i mean six months ago i i woulda done it i woulda done it just to please him
that is sick
god it is so clean out here
i am into garbage it is my thing
oh good okay
it is wonderful i mean you know they just watch movies all day

there s no no question in my mind i think we are doing the mature thing without any doubt
now look all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine
remember that day
right geez i feel like there s a great weight off my back m mmm
yeah my analyst thinks this move is keen for me
yeah and i i tru you know i trust her because my my analyst recommended her
well why should i put you through all my moods and hang ups anyway
we can always come back together again because there s no there s no problem cause right
exactly but exactly ooooh
you know i i i do not think many couples could handle this you know they could just break up and remain friends
you look very pretty
oh no i just lost a little weight that is all well you look nice
you see i i have been thinking about it and i think that we should get married
oh alvy come on
so whatta you you are not gonna come back to new york
that is so great about new york i mean it is a dying city you read death in venice
hey you did not read death in venice till i bought it for yuh

no we are friends i wanna remain friends
okay check please can i can i can i can i
you are mad are not you

if you must know it is a hectic time for tony the grammys are tonight
the what
the grammys he is got a lotta records up for awards
oh hi duane how is it goin
this is my room
oh yeah terrific
what would i do
step up here
what would i do
why i was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity
six year old boys do not have girls on their minds
why could not you have been more like donald now there was a model boy
yeah two more chairs and they got a dining room set
why are you so hostile
oh really i heard that commentary and dissent had merged and formed dysentery
here you are there s people out there
hey you would not believe this two minutes ago the knicks are ahead fourteen points and now they are ahead two points
alvy do not you are using sex to express hostility
why why do you always r reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories he said as he removed her brassiere
oh i am sorry
do not get upset
hey come on it is quiet now we can we can start again
my head is throbbing
oh you got a headache
where are you going
man that is great that is just great
you catch dylan
me no no i i could not make it that ni my my raccoon had hepatitis
you have a raccoon
tsch a few
the only word for this is trans plendid it is trans plendid
really it must be a tremendous hem
i am a rosicrucian myself
i cannot get with any religion that advertises in popular mechanics look there s god coming outta the men s room
it is unbelievably trans plendid i was at the stones concert in altamount when they killed that guy remember
oh sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience
oh tsch thank you h m
i mean that as a compliment
i think i think there s too much burden placed on the orgasm you know to make up for empty areas in life
you know it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another you know what i am talking about
key word here is indulgent
without getting well let s put it this way
it is like samuel beckett you know i admire the technique but he does not he does not hit me on a gut level
probably on their first date right
what i would not give for a large sock o horse manure
thank you very much it is a pleasure
uh you guys are still uh you are still new yorkers
i am not myself since i stopped smoking
sixteen years ago

good night
oh miss kubelik i have been waiting for you fran you have
i almost did not recognize you this is the first time i have ever seen you in civilian clothes
how would you make out on the twenty seventh floor
i thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first and then
i am sorry but i cannot tonight i am meeting somebody
oh you mean like a girl friend
i was not trying to be personal it is just that the fellows in the office were whether you wondering about you ever
just tell em now and then
this date is it just a date or is it something serious
it used to be serious at least i was but he was not so the whole thing is more or less kaputt
well in that case could not you
i am afraid not i promised to have a drink with him he is been calling me all week
well it was just an idea i hate to see a ticket go to waste
what time does the show go on
eight thirty
well i could meet you at the theatre if that is all right
all right that is wonderful it is the majestic 44th street
how is your cold
what cold and after the show we could go out on the town i have been taking from arthur murray
so i see
they got a great little band at el chico in the village it is practically around the corner from where you live
how come
well do not tell the fellows in the office about the appendix they may get the wrong idea how you found out bye
marry christmas
thank you i thought you were avoiding me
what gave you that idea
in the last six weeks you have only been in my elevator once and then you did not take your hat off
well as a matter of fact i was rather hurt when you stood me up that night
i do not blame you it was unforgivable
i forgive you
one more
i should not drink when i am driving
by the power vested in me i herewith declare this elevator out of order shall we join the natives
you all right that is the matter
guess i made a boo boo huh
no i like it
really you mean you would not be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this
of course not
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side is that better
this is a bad day for me
i understand christmas family and all that
i would better get back to my elevator i do not want to be fired
i think so

i am sorry mr baxter
miss kubelik you should not be out of bed

his apartment
i mean her apartment
when are you coming home
as soon as i can walk
something wrong with your legs
no it is my stomach
your stomach
they had to pump it out
but they will be worried about me my brother in law may be calling the police
that is why we have to be careful we do not want to involve anybody after all mr sheldrake is a married man
i did not mean it that way i was just talking to him on the phone he is very concerned about you
he does not give a damn about me
oh you are wrong he told me
oh did you find something here an envelope

a cemetery
you better win a hand you are on a blitz
was he really upset when you told him

you really think so
no doubt about it
can i have that pad and the pencil
what for
i am going to write a letter to mrs sheldrake
you are
as one woman to another i am sure she will understand
why not

pick up your cards and let s go
do i have to
who was that
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne like some
now do not go getting any ideas miss kubelik

yeah sure i am corky
rajeev the man who usually works on the building
so this is temporary for you
i guessed you were straight black
mmmm thanks i needed this
my pleasure but to be honest i did have a slightly ulterior motive here i was wondering if i could ask a small favor
oh i am sorry
no it is not your fault the walls here are just so thin
are they really
yes it really causes problems sometimes it is like you are in the same room but if it is too much trouble i understand
no no trouble there s other work to do
truck of course

i knew it
so how do you know the owner mr bianchinni
i do not really i was referred to him
do you know him
no but caesar does he likes him says he is a good italian
caesar is your husband
oh no shit i did not know he would call you god you must think i am a total nuisance
not exactly
i am sorry i usually would call rajeev but i did not know what to do so i called mr bianchinni
he said you lost something
i am sorry look forget it i should not have called
thank you so much you have to let me pay you something
okay one drink
what do you want
a beer
curious maybe
you dropped that earring down the drain on purpose did not you
i had to see you
look i do not think this is a good idea
i wanted to apologize
i needed that
caesar s mafia is not he
funny nobody calls it that anymore caesar calls it the business
how did you meet him
they took over a club i was working at caesar started managing it
how long have you been with him
almost five years
five years is a long time
is not that what you wanted to know what i did time for
the redistribution of wealth
that is what i tell someone when i am trying to get them in my bed
i am already in your bed
you did not have to tell me if you did not want to
i guess i wanted to
i am glad you did
yes there is i felt it this morning when i brought you the coffee
shit here we go
you did not want to see me did you
if there is one thing i cannot stand about sleeping with women it is all the fucking mind reading
what are you afraid of
i am not afraid of anything
i do not understand
i know you cannot understand because we are different violet we are different
we are not that different corky
how can you sit in that bed and say that
oh no she is nothing like you she is a lot smarter than you
is that what her daddy tells her
i know what i am i do not need to have it tattooed on my shoulder
what are you saying that you do not have sex with men
i do not
for christ s sake violet i heard you thin walls remember
what you heard was not sex
we make our own choices and we pay our own prices i think we are more alike than you want to admit
what about that guy this morning
you mean shelly
do not tell me you are a workaholic
no shelly knows what i am he saw me in a bar with another woman
fuck it i think you better leave
i want out i want a new life i see what i have been waiting for but i need you corky
for what
you made a choice once do you think you would make that same choice again
what choice
caesar is going to get the money and bring
how much money
caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through shelly s books to figure out how he did it
that is why i need your help you said you were good
all right let s say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying
all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected someone like me
is that what you think
do you think you know me like that
then what exactly
and where is it now
it is in a case on his desk
it sounded like he and caesar do not like each other
gino marzzone
marzzone as in angelo marzzone head of the marzzone family
yeah twice
what happened
does johnnie hit on you
johnnie hits on anything in high heels
has caesar ever seen him
he does it right in front of him
what did gino drink
what time did you say they would be there
the plane is in at seven so i would say about eight
any bodyguards
we want him to come down to relax feel in control again
where will you be
and as you do the bottle will slip from your hands and shatter against the hardwood floor
an accident
what if he sees you
you cannot know for certain that he will not see you
i am just asking what if
there is no going back
when i get the scotch how do i know you will not take off
i still do not see how i am going to get clean with the money in the apartment everyone will think i did it
if it is real enough he will believe it because deep down he will want to
he will have to run
if he runs everyone will assume he took the money
jesus that is beautiful
thank you
i had a partner and she fucked me
i will not
it is me
he totally freaked i have never seen him like this he is out of his fucking mind
it is all right violet it is working all we got to do is wait him out and see what he does
what if he does not run
that means he probably will kill johnnie
okay all right
oh thank god
i am still here
i was so afraid you
i am sorry corky
how would it go
hey caesar you take care of this girl or i find out
done we go now
unbelievable can you believe that violet
johnnie what did i say
you should not have to see this why do not you get out of here go for a walk
caesar wants me to stay
oh god

all right you have heard of the emperor caligula perhaps or jack the ripper
they were vampires
does the world duhh mean anything to you
nice conversationalist yeah i felt em a little but i ai not due for two weeks since you are so excited about the subject
it is natural a reaction to their presence to the unnaturalness of it it is part of how you are able to track them
oh wonderful my secret weapon is pms that is just great thanks for telling me
you will get used to it i am more worried about your tactical mistakes
you are such a wet
so basically i have got the life expectancy of a zit right

i will not be here when you get back but i will be in touch and thanks
for what
you saved my life
he says a dog bit his nose
arf you gotta help me
lucky guess um i would feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here
do not tell me you are naked back there
what took so long you were in there all day
that is how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out a lot of people are after you jerry
dead or alive they will stick me in there with oswald another lunatic acting alone
oswald was an assassin you are not an assassin are you jerry
if you are worried about the president call and warn him about the space shuttle
right sit up so i can see you
uh uh do not want them to see me
them who
crown victoria f b i car a legitimate tail
as opposed to
people more serious about their work you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it
that is how a man would do it i am not a man
see was not that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans
nothing is easy
how long have we known each other jerry
you have the right to ask me certain personal questions
nothing scary there sorry
that is it
so why are they after you
i am not sure i think i figured something out it must have been in my newsletter
so i am a little jumpy who would not be
you are certifiable
you would not be sitting here if you did not halfway believe me
you okay
you know why the grateful dead are always on tour
surprise me
you want something to drink
if my universe had a hub
i have been reading up on it
here it is conspiracy theory it just went out tuesday third issue this year i bet i struck a nerve pissed someone off
can you prove any of this
pretty scary huh
yeah how many subscribers do you have
just five it is the economy you think maybe one of them is not who they seem
holden caulfield catcher in the rye
never heard of him
what are you doing
was that who i thought it was
uh huh
has this happened to you before
never but i have been practicing
who are you jerry
it made me feel like you could see inside of me and i do not know how that is possible
so that is the question
i will give you 100 bucks if you leave right now
is this your dad
that was him
is he dead
please put it down
how would he die
he is why you punish yourself
johnny dancer right you do not ride him anymore do you not since your dad died
did you see the van back there
what van
never mind you would think i was making it up
where would you get your subscribers
i put an ad on a computer bulletin board i log on at the library so i cannot be traced
well i have been tracking them down all morning
you have not been bothering them have you
maybe you better not try i worked so hard to keep quiet like a mouse i should have realized
realized what
and you think group one is at war with group two
latest casualty ernest harriman you heard of him
sure one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago
right here in manhattan
it said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool in newport
nobody dies in newport they could not even kill sunny von bulow there harriman drowned but it was not in newport
i see the big picture and you stumble around in the details
they are big details jerry
do you watch the news read the paper last week this whole place was underwater
okay i will
you will
i like you jerry a lot
oh christ here it comes look i know you think i am crazy i do not think i am but
jerry i
what if i reached a point where you did not think i was crazy anymore if i was normal
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking coca cola again
yeah would you i mean could you love me then if i was normal maybe
you are wrong since i met you i do not dream about holes anymore
holes i do not know what you are talking about
yesterday you were wondering about the wall how it was possible
now s not really the time to get into this
i would never hurt you liza think whatever you want but do not think that
i do not i know you would not
no that would not be fair where are we going jerry
what is it
we are going to queens
now what
after you it is okay i am the one who left it here
what about them
how come serial killers have two names but lone gunman assassins have three john wilkes booth mark david chapman lee harvey oswald
john hinkley the guy who shot reagan he only had two names
my father s house
did you kill him
is that what they told you
then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box
he gave it to me
i do not understand
where were you the day he died
at a horse show
that is the last time you rode is not it do you think it was your fault is that why
yeah i know what it is like

you have been my best friend for years and i did not even know you were out there
they changed franklin s portrait
you think it is a conspiracy
i love you too
do i know you
i am a very patient man
that is great good for you
who have you been talking to jerry who else knows what you know
that is that
you should not watch jerry it is a moment without hope
liza sutton is dead
thank you
i am not sure what you mean
you should think of me as liza sutton s guardian angel
that is ironic because we are here to protect her from you
you are here because you figured i might show up
you made your decision yet
i will do it on one condition i want to make sure she is okay
we got someone watching her 24 hours a day she
that is not what i mean i want to see her
i do not know
then screw you i will rot
can i ask you something
a dog bit it
excuse me
you were going to ask about my nose the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today
and you feel bad for it
so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president
you already asked me that why do you insist on making me repeat myself
and you have no idea where he lives
i am sorry what was the question again
why you
honestly i think he has a crush on me
a charming term now why him
excuse me
veritas truth what is it they say about truth
the truth shall make you free
that is it i went to yale i hope you will not hold that against me
i did not know the c i a had psychiatrists
we are very specialized
if you are as impressed to see me as i am to see you you are very impressed indeed how is jerry feeling this morning
fine what the hell is going on
years ago i worked for the c i a in the m k ultra program are you familiar with it
it was mind control manchurian candidate kind of stuff right
a vulgar pop term but yes take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin that was our goal
ask what you can do for your country that kind of thing
m k ultra was terminated in 1973 but not the research it was renamed ex catcher
as in catcher in the rye
as in resulting in death we pushed the envelope until it was not even an envelope anymore
missionary penance you talk about it like it was a religion
jerry told me he bit your nose
and what did i say
a dog
my dog one i intend to put to sleep extrapolate from there
these things you are talking about you did them to jerry
i am still listening
jerry is dangerous jerry has killed
where would you get it
you do recognize it then
it was my father s kept it in his wallet he was murdered
i know the story a federal judge he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial
not a man ezekiel walters
walters had nothing to do with your father s murder
in jerry s safety deposit box
it is okay i am game
night after that
look you are a nice guy but i am not really dating right now
i am not that good at no liza
liza settle a bet for us
federal bureau of investigation
i need to speak with an agent lowry
the office is closed for the evening is this an emergency
go ahead miss sutton
ah your psychotic is here
tell him i am on vacation that i will not be back for two weeks
this does not make sense
it makes perfect sense field work is not our oeuvre
i do not like it something s wrong
dr jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate why is that
we are waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up this guy fletcher s something else
guy s a c i a shrink here to i would fletcher they knew each other somehow
which way did he go
that is the book hinkley had on him when he shot reagan
you are welcome spooks so you want to compare notes on this guy
agent lowry
when i am ready to compare notes i will let you know
can i talk to you a second
do you believe me
yeah i do
i want to believe you too
who s the deputy director of the f b i
what gave me away
and jonas
he is why i watch jerry jerry s the bait for jonas
he is shown himself why have not you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do
jonas builds assassins for a living several of whom may be in place already we would like to kill a few birds with one stone
where do you think jerry is
no idea honest what are you going to do
i am going to find him because he would find me
do not go home and do not go to work either one could be bad
what do you suggest
that you come with me
you are back
how is the arm still sore
much better you have been gone so long
li mu bai is coming to stay the night
she is crazy you should have killed her
i did not have the heart
who are you
i do not care about your sword
is not it a bit too late to be out you have brought me the sword
where is your master
do you think you are a real master
like most things i am nothing it is the same for this sword all of it is simply a state of mind
stop talking like a monk just fight
then tell me where jade fox is
on guard
why do you want to teach me
i have always wanted a disciple worthy of wudan s secrets
and if i use them to kill you
who are you why is the green destiny in your possession
that is it to you
my name is li mu bai the green destiny is mine jade fox cannot be your master where did you learn that xuan piu move
i am just playing around
tell me who is your master
you are home late or should i say early
i will never live as a thief
you are already a thief
that was just for fun how can i leave where would i go
wherever we want we will get rid of anyone in our way even your father
shut up
it is the giang hu fighter lifestyle kill or be killed exciting is not it
i owe you nothing
you think you have been teaching me all these years from the manual you could not even decipher the symbols
in that case perhaps we could be of assistance
do not bother
you do not seem to understand
are you related to li mu bai
please sit
i have made you silk pajamas do you want to change into them
put them down
i heard you met shu lien today
do you know her
i will socialize with whomever i please
i am tired now
go to bed then miss has grown up and is getting married soon god knows what the future will bring
it will be just the same enough i am tired
this spells trouble
beautiful but dangerous once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire it is 400 years old
exquisite you said it belongs to
my friend li mu bai he is given it to sir te as a gift
li mu bai the famous warrior why would he give his sword to sir te
you are too young to understand
it must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free
fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we would not survive for long
i have read all about people like you roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way
writers would not sell many books if they told how it really is
but you are just like the characters in the stories
sure no place to bathe for days sleeping in flea infested beds they tell you all about that in those books
you know what i mean i am getting married soon but i have not lived the life i want
so i heard congratulations it is the most important step in a woman s life is not it
you are not married are you
what do you think
no you could not roam around freely if you were
i have missed you
how so
you are doing calligraphy
you write gracefully calligraphy is so similar to fencing
do you think so let me tell you a story
about you and li mu bai
yes did you know i was once engaged to be married
too bad for meng but it is not your fault or li mu bai s
i am not an aristocrat as you are but i must still respect a woman s duties
do not distance us from now on let s be like sisters
you say she killed a policeman
here you must be in proper attire
i am just borrowing some clean clothes i am not staying
i will give them to you
they forced me to marry
go back to them first then you can decide about lo
you know about lo
he really loves you come back to peking with me we will find a solution
where is he now
li mu bai has made arrangements he sent him to wudan mountain
do not touch it that is li mu bai s sword
come and get it if you can
without the green destiny you are nothing
you cannot die tell us what poison you used you cannot die tell us the antidote you cannot let li mu bai die
take my horse and go to the compound give this to mrs wu she will help you hurry
stop it you do not deserve the green destiny
not another lecture on guard
let s end this here
what do you want
what i have always wanted to teach you
let s stop a moment
give it back
you have got quite a temper it is better this way
you coward
no more hitting on the head all this trouble for a comb
it is mine it means a lot to me a barbarian like you would not understand
not true i can use it to pick fleas from my horse
by the way i am a real manchurian
i am sorry i guessed wrong i though you were a han
give me back my comb
i do not take orders from anyone
so you are still that little boy looking for shooting stars
your father s men are still looking for you they are still out there circling closer
let them look
keep it safe return it to me when we are together again
i will
do you remember the legend of the young man
a faithful heart makes wishes come true
mu bai it is been too long
it has how is business
the mountain must be so peaceful i envy you my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest
i left the training early
what was it
something i cannot let go of you are leaving soon
we are preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking
the green destiny sword you are giving it to sir te
i am he has always been our greatest protector
i do not understand how can you part with it it has always been with you
too many men have died at its edge it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade
you use it justly you are worthy of it
it is time for me to leave it behind
sir te believes it is a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu
but something is going on at the yu household
jade fox impossible
you always suspected she would fled to the west
i did not think she would dare come back to peking
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu
it says jade fox is hiding at yu s on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yu s were you involved
it was bo sir te s man i hear he followed the thief to the yus
have you questioned him yet
no not yet
that is not what i meant i do not care about the sword
what do you mean did not you come back here for it
i do not know it was stolen until i got here
then why did you come
i admit getting it back makes me realize how much i would missed it
my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone i was not about to ruin her life or her father s
you did your job well but this girl i saw her last night
i knew she would intrigue you
that is not for her she should come to wudan and become a disciple
but wudan does not accept women
for her they might make an exception if not i am afraid she will become a poisoned dragon
it is not our affair even if wudan accepts her her husband might object
i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world but the cycle of bloodshed continues
i wish there were something more i could do to help you
do not you want to see her again
not everything is an illusion my hand was not that real
we are close to your headquarters go home and check in
what about you
i will look around and catch up later
what happened
jade fox drugged her how did you get here
my blood will soon reverse its flow it is the same poison she used to kill my master there is no antidote
mu bai hold on give me some hope
shu lien
save your strength
madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts she is being so considerate
i am sorry she is not feeling well enough to receive you today
we know who stole the missing item if the thief returns it i am sure sir te will pursue the matter no further
that is good sometimes the help cannot keep their hands to themselves it is very embarassing
sir te knows that even well meaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families
but do not be too lenient
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking
a murderer
yes the very killer of li mu bai s own master last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down
maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same
it is jade fox
they are gone
what does it say
if you surrender now you will suffer less but if you resist i will not stop until you are dead
please sir te what is it
li mu bai giving up his sword and his warrior days maybe he is trying to tell you something
has governor yu ever seen the sword
yes though i doubt he is involved in this
but the sword could be in his compound
this is a delicate matter
sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter
what do you have in mind
looks like ya gonna take office just in time chief things need straightening up in this city

burke take a look at this damn thing it just does not make sense
why it is perfectly plain your the teacher at the college you do not want the building torn down
c mon i can read for christ sake
well that is wrong
well why are they tearing the building down
what honey
well he does know the background i doubt there s any danger in just having him assist there should be a psychiatrist present anyway
and what about the exorcist any ideas
how about lankaster merrin
merrin i had notion he was over in iraq i think i read he was working on a dig around nineveh
that is right mike but he is finished and came back around three ot four months ago he is in woodstock now
that is he doing there teaching
no he is working on another book
do not you think he is too old though how is his health
it must be alright he is still running around digging up tombs besides he is had experience
i did not know that
it might be best to have a man with experience maybe someone who s spent time in the foreign missions
i see your excellency
let s see whose around in the meantime i will call you as soon as i know
look i am telling you again and you would better believe it i am not about to put her in a goddamn asylum
it is
and i do not care what you call it i am not putting her away
i am sorry
hi how would your day go
oh great anything else
and you got an invitation
that is this
dinner at the white house
your kidding me what is it a big party or something
just five or six people
maybe the circuit is busy
oh circuit my ass he does not give a shit
what the hell do you mean going out and leaving regan by her self what are you kidding her window s wide open
what did not he tell you
that is burke got to do with it
well when i went to get the thorazine i had him to stay with her and oh i should of known better
what did the doctor say
oh burke poor burke
this was under regan s pillow did you put it there
where do you want this
i am gonna miss you
me too
does your daughter remember if perhaps mr dennings was in her room in her room that night
no she was heavily sedated
it is serious
yes i am affraid it is
may i ask
we still do not know
no not at all
you were expecting a deliver y that day
not that i know of
groceries maybe a package
i really would not know you see karl takes care of that
oh i see
want to ask him
look he would not have any reason to be up there in the first place
i know that i realize but if a certain british doctor never asked that is this fungus we would not today have penicillin correct
when she is well enough i will ask
i hate to ask you this but for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph
oh she would love it
i lied it is for me the spelling is on the back kinderman you know that film you made called angel isaw that six times
thank you
good morning madame
but it is clean
no no rats
yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps
yes i go now
there is nothing
oh karl jesus christ karl do not do that
very sorry but you see no rats
karl did you put this in regan s bedroom
she is going to be well
karl if you put this in regan s room i want you to tell me now did you
a man to see you
excuse me madame will there be anything else
good morning mrs macneil
how are you today
fine thank you
is it coming out willie
why the math
now this is for ritalin ten miligrams a day
what is it a tranquilizer
a stimulant
well you mentioned her father the divorce
do you think i should take her to see a psychiatrist
oh no i would wait and see what happens with the ritalin i think that is the answer wait two or three weeks
ya know those things to get attention like saying that her bed shakes and stuff
well you see that is quite similar to things like her lying uncharacter
wait a minute what are you talking about
well she let loose quite a string while i was examining her mrs macneil
you are kidding like what
well i would say her vocabulary s rather extensive
hey come on i am grown up what would she say i mean specifically doctor
well specifically mrs macneil she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt
she used those words
she used those words look i doubt that she even understood what she was saying
yeah i guess maybe not you do not think a psychiatrist
so what causes this
lesion lesion in the temperal lobe it is a kind of seizure disorder
look doc i really do not understand how her whole personality could change
the temperal lobe is very common could last for days even weeks it is not rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour
hey do me a favour will ya tell me something good
she is heavily sedated she will probably sleep through tomorrow
do you keep any drugs in your house
no of course not nothing like that
are you sure
well of course i am sure i would tell you christ i do not even smoke grass
chris macneil
please go away
oh i am very sorry father hi
that is okay i should have told you i would not be in uniform
so how would a shrink ever get to be a priest
harvard bellevue john hopkins
you are a friend of father dyer right
yes am
pretty close
pretty close
did he tell you about my party
sure did
about my daughter
no i did not know you had one
did not tell you of what she did
he did not mention her
priests keep pretty tight mouthed then
that depends
on what
if he came to me for spritual help i would say no
you would not
no i would not but i would try to persuade him to turn himself in
and how do you go about getting an exorcism
i beg your pardon
if a person was possessed by a demon of some kind how do you go about getting an exorcism
well the first thing i would do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century
i did not get you
well it just does not happen anymore mrs macneil
that is all the more reason to forget about exorcism
why i do not understand
to begin with it could make things worse
but how
well before the church approves an exorcism it conducts an investigation to see if it is warranted that takes time in the meantime
you could do it yourself
no i could not i have to have church approval and frankly that is rarely given
could you see her
no you do not understand your daughter
thanks look i am only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good
nothing you could do would make it any worse
i cannot do it i need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession
like what
like her speaking in a language that she is never known or studied
what else
i do not know i will have to look it up
did you know my mother died recently
yes i did i am sorry
no is regan aware of it
not at all why would you ask
no it is alright i will take it straight
are you sure
where is regan s father
in europe
i told regan that was holy water i sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently it is tap water
that is the difference
what did you do today
um stuff
what kind of stuff
oh mom you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse was not it pretty

you this director was doing a film here burke dennings
i have seen him
you have seen him you are also familiar with how last week he died
only what i read in the papers
papers tell me what do you know about the subject of witchcraft from the witching end not the hunting
from the psychiatric end
i know i read it these desecration s in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft
maybe some rituals used in black mass maybe
and dennings you read how he died
could not it of happened on the fall
exactly so on the one hand we have got a witchcraft type of murder and a black mass style of desecration in the church
you think the killer and the desecrator are the same
maybe somebody crazy someone with a spite against the church some unconscious rebellion perhaps
i do not know anyone who fits the description
ah doctor s ethics if you knew you would not tell huh
is that a threat
no i mentioned it only in passing

perfect fit
nice looking kid
how old is he
yes someone might want to tear him apart snuff him out for revenge
and this thing can grow it
yes pollux bought one along with the original batch obviously he found a way to make more
why would he need more
he is your brother you figure it out maybe he made another bomb
or reactivated the first one
what do you mean
i was in a coma pollux i still feel like shit
you porked his wife the day he was arrested how could you forget that
i do not know everything s jumbled so you are going to have to help me fill in a few blanks
uh to kill the doctors
after that you promised you would always take care of me
and i bet i have kept that promise
that is not the worst part
that is worse than losing five million bucks
thanks pollux
for what
for being one helluva guy
well you tried you failed miserably but you tried
everything i say is wrong i cannot talk to her anymore
she is only 12 some day she will understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying i love you
is that what you think
jon we just remember how it used to be you staying for a while or is this just a piss stop
we need to talk
i am late for surgery
it is important
i was dreaming
something good
we were back in high school you wanted to join the sky diving team but i would not let you
must have been after we got engaged
actually in this dream i was your mother
so you had a nightmare
totally you were being very very bad you went up in the plane and jumped out you had a parachute but it did not open
how come
five years i still cannot get it out of my head an inch to the left matty would still be alive
what are you saying oh god you are going on assignment again
one last time it is important
you said you would be here you promised me you promised jamie what could be more important than that
i cannot tell you except only i can do it
is someone there
who is this
never mind that just take jamie and get out of that house do not tell anyone where you are going especially not him just go
okay you are having an emotional crisis you need to seek the help of a trained
think about it eve everything he is done recently has been peculiar right he is said and done things your husband would never do
whoever you are do not call again
i know you you are the one who called you are castor troy you killed my son
i took it from my fake husband
why point it at me i am the real thing
i do not know that maybe jon s already dead
what more proof do you need
he freaked out when he thought i had seen this stuff i think it is a list of cities santiago ho chi minh city nandi
our pacific rim stations these numbers must be bounties castor s not wasting any time
what do you mean
you cannot go you cannot be anywhere near that place
jon what is it
the bomb he is reactivated it and everyone there is going to die
cannot we call someone admiral lazarro
i know lazarro the first person she would call is me we cannot take the chance of tipping castor off
how is he
no life signs at all he is a turnip
i started wondering if you could not switch back would it make a difference
would it
how is loomis
apparently fine he is coming into work that is the good news
go on
we can send in a plant try to get pollux to spill the location
which ear was it
jon this is goddam insane you cannot go through with it what about eve
do not worry i have done my homework i will get pollux to talk
now what
this is it jon for the next 72 hours you are on your own
how is the date night idea going over with eve
like gangbusters doc okay i missed the last one
you missed the last three including her birthday your wife s gripe sheet
one of my informants spotted him right here in the city
i just asked you about making love to your wife and you started talking about your job
i am not hiding in my work if that is what you are saying
jon i am getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun
that is it to you i declare it here i am back in the states for less than a month
you can tell me all about it from your prison cell
not anymore
what are you going to do castor
stay away from my family
what what are you doing
i do not know how long before it kills us
give up castor people are going to find out
they are too tight
you will what
you better be nice castor you could get mighty lonely now that pollux is gone
pollux is what
archer cut him a deal for turning state s evidence he is free
walton you have to let me see the warden
sfpd castor is not stupid enough to come back to the city
we have got him sighted okay pollux pull out
what makes you so sure this guy s gonna set up his own brother
just saving the tax payers the cost of a trial so take a hike
that is the matter with your voice commander
clarissa left those here
i will not tell mom if you do not
when did you start smoking
get a higher arc on the ball jamie and for chrissake square your shoulders to the basket
what are you stupid
you mean like condoms
oh commander i did not see you
that is your name is not it
you always call me miss brewster
you have got someone in your office
get rid of them
you picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off
what happened
castor s escaped
what happened
commander what are you doing here
where should i be where is everyone else
it was confirmed by your personal security code nobody knows that code but you
you are both in custody until there s a dna fingerprinting and we can prove who s who now put the gun down
you merciless bastard
i cannot even look at you without wanting to vomit
do not get mad but i just went for a little stroll through the company switches
are you trying to give us away for somebody with such a big brain you think awfully small
i am just having some fun
eight pocket stingers seven piper uzis six cobra carbines five net launch ers
we gut the organization and rebuild it with more reliable friends
most of the current chiefs they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads
all of them do we will kill twelve birds with one bomb and we will be rich
you will need to recultivate that virus
what about me
a lot of people think you are a snitch it is dangerous
look at you jon at your age an american hero i would buy you a drink but i know you would just turn me down
you are the only person in this place who can see right through me
you have made us look pretty good in the past week and the way you handled the press
just following your example
d c s very high on giving you the promotion there s just one problem
that is that
me i have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job
you would have to start immediately
done in fact i was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs
i just heard about castor s fratricide rather poetic do not you think
what is it admiral i am under the gun here
i just thought that under the circumstances you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs
no most of them are in transit by now i am heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security
what happened to your big assignment
what do you know about it
as much as ever nothing
it did not work out as planned where are you off to
the hospital
the hospital oh that is right you are a doctor ha ha
jon i do not have time to play games there are leftovers in the fridge
what is with you tonight
hurry up the salad s getting warm and the pasta s getting cold
why do i feel like i am on a blind date
i think you are trying to get me drunk
would not be the first time or would it
is not that what all this is about letting jamie go out cooking me dinner your next assignment
i am not going anywhere
i am replacing lazarro nice safe desk job just like you wanted
that is great
you are wearing your suit
that is on your mind
jon it is the tenth i know how difficult it is for you but we still have to go
i am late gotta protect and serve the world y know
the world can wait jon you are going
great he is 17 you told her to stay away from him
oh that karl
yes jon that karl
where is jamie
i will deal with her later
i am going to the powder room
remember this from our junior prom boy were you ever mad for madonna
back then who was not
kimberly burroughs eh what do you want
i thought i thought you might be able to help me
yeah how
i had a premonition about the route 18 pile up i saved some people and now i think death is after me
it is not just about me someone i saved died last night in a freak accident what if the others are in danger too
well if you put them on the list they are already tits up
what list
officer burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends
the songs on the radio but wait i do not understand why is this even happening to me
the second one just dies a 16 year old kid
you have to tell us now
i was driving a white van it must have gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and i drowned it was horrible
you were there
i can practically taste the water in my throat and something else the smell of flowers
what about that
are you crazy what makes you think you would survive
what happened when eugene tried to kill himself out of turn
six duds in a row
this makes no sense isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested
what did you see what am i looking for
what do you want me to do
speed up
what did you see
no it cannot be
a mortician he seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us
should we knock
make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight
then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect eugene and isabella for as long as we can
a guard grabbed me before i could find eugene
do not sweat it it is over
jury duty that is randomly selected by social security numbers
random sure
um clear i am sorry about before i
i am not sure i understand
the only reason he was on route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings
that lucky bastard
freaked me out so bad i hid in a shopping cart for four hours course missed the show
dano should not we go back and help your mother
calm down kimmy it is not drugs just weed
a trans am that shit went out with new kids on the block
dano should not we stop and help your mother
dano should not we stop and help your mother
tell me you did not start up on that flight 180 shit again did you
look you were not there it was weird she knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident she knew never mind
you have made your point
what do you mean grand theft auto this is insane
hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by monday morning
damn they always stick me with the clunker
please it is not going to wait
i have got to stop and help those people
are you jorge cruz

may we come in
we had a fight some things got broken the dog went crazy she left me would not say where she was going

first i am stuck with jury duty now this nonsense
this cannot be happening my career s at a peak i finally met a cute guy i just bought a new house
last july i dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident they asked me what number means good luck in jewish
eighteen and it is hebrew
yeah so what happened
that is going on here
that is the truck that is going to kill everyone
alright miss calm down i just need this lane open i need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder
tell me again how it started
like i said it was like i was there i remember everything the sounds of the crashes the smells the look on shaina s face
billboards about accidents kids yelling pile up for no reason it all felt just wrong just like
you mean alex browning
i tried calling last night but your father
i know i have gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp we are all meeting at my apartment tonight

yes it was you have made it clear that if i can cut a little piano i might get a little response
it is convenient to fake looking for something right now is not it
i am not faking anything i am looking for some bath oil
i do not find your language that charming
it is direct anyway which seems to be difficult for you
serious that is that is important to you
no do not do that
no inner feeling
that is right
that is what you said
as a matter of fact he is the one who introduced me to carl how are you
i am fine
carl restored my confidence he really did he is much more substantial than you give him credit for
do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now
i could spend some time with you tomorrow morning before carl comes back i mean if you would like to
where are you going
i am going to pick up some friends of carl s are you all right

i am all ears
why do not you try suicide
my company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me and i have a wife suicide would nullify my insurance murder does not
so why pick me
you are a drifter a pardon the expression beach bum no one would notice if you disappeared i have watched you for a couple weeks

sometimes yes sometimes no the staff usually forgets
i rent them monthly lease with an option to buy
a 357
very good my 357 use it and no one can trace it to you the room will be in some disarray
so it looks like a burglary attempt you catch me i get the gun and shoot you
precisely are you a good shot
that is the difference the noise will kill you first
get me on the first shot if you can
do you have a passport
sure all drifters do
fine after you kill me take the jaguar the keys will be in the glove compartment
lax go to the pan am desk there will be a ticket waiting for you
where am i going
rio flight 306 departs at eleven pm
you have certainly thought this out have not you
i am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance mr nugent
you sure those doors will be open
yes all you provide are the gloves the passport and the aim i will take care of everything else
the gun the money the tickets and the dying
that is right
you sure got the hard part
can i steal you for a minute
magic today huh

preoccupied with what
why do you keep doing this
stay i must be having an off day i am really a fabulous player
i have this effect on lots of women
i bet you do
say the reason i asked about alan is that i bumped into him this morning and you know what i cannot figure out
alan s in utah

very big
i opened thousands of brains
what did you find
big mess every time
i wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil i ate and drove i had one of those big checkered cabs
we must abandon
what do you mean we must abandon
we must abandon
contaminated substance very dangerous shooting mud
i never left the garage without my windex
i was barrister in kenya i said to him get off from here i cannot drive with your body on my windscreen
under the manhattan bridge
guys ready to order
this is a great young out of work actress
say it again
alla puttanesca
nicky i was thinking about you i went to the preview last night
a lovely piece of theater small but important
shut up elliot
you are an artist i am a craftsman
press a button and they give us money
how is lillian i have not seen her
she wants a divorce
do not talk like that
it is over finished and done with
that sounds so final but are we really surprised
i am completely stunned i do not want this to happen
but did not we know it would happen
do not needle me elliot tell me how bad you feel we are suppose to feel bad together this is what friends do
very dangerous
asbestos lining
we must abandon
i am trying to think when did you start looking so terrible you look awful
i can tell you the year the day the night the minute
you used to love life you do not exude this any more
what do i exude
suffering you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread
tonight you find out what it means to suffer
tonight that is tonight
shit they do not have any carrot soup
you mean because that is his name
you will suffer because he is in the theater and you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears
it is just a review
it is just a review do not inhale very dangerous
that is the fuss i do not get it
that is what i said eighteen months ago
and he was there
steven schwimmer i memorized every word of this review
that is awful
i recite it to myself with masochistic relish
what was it like
is it safe
do we care
i think we nought to wait
i say we go
you say we go
do not inhale
i am not ready
where are you going
do not wait efor me
he carries a gun
i used to carry a gun when i drove a cab
where is it
i gave it away i thought i am a writer now
we are making too much of this
no we are not
i am not a lonely spooky writer like you nursing a hundred grudges i am a man who loves life
in other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse the man is out there ruining lives
it is your best play nicky
shoot him
the american theater does not need people like that
shoot him nicky not that we really mean it but where does he live
keep going west last building before the river
how do you eknow
paisley porter
had to be him
i think you are a little confused nothing personal friend
what are you talking about
what are we talking about
of course i saw it
did you see the winning run score
this could be it
this could be it
let s work on it
this could pbe it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
this could be it
does it feel comfortable
does what feel comfortable
this could be it
last night alan albright called me a handsome woman second time he is done that son of a bitch
i hear alan s sick
alan s very sick he has to go to new mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution
you know about adele
what about her
she is dying
she died
i talked to her two days ago
apparently it did not help you know about peter of course
can he get through it
they are watching him closely there s a special rehearsal set for this afternoon to bolster his confidence and that is not all
i have got bigger problems joanna personal problems
that is not all nicky i have been backing your plays for fifteen years and i have never been more depressed
about what
steven schwimmer the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan
look all i want is a haircut i am not worried about this guy
ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater nobody in this business has been worried about anything else
the red sox
i am proud of this play it is so different from anything you have done
this is how we have managed to last
we are able to surprise each other
in and out of bed
because we are completely mismatched
i used to tell myself talent is more erotic when it is wasted will i see you tonight
it makes me so mad steven schwimmer ready to strike the exterminating angel
it is all worked out they will lose tonight then they will lose tomorrow i see it with stunning clarity
it is your best play nicky
they will lose because they are my team
i never see you anymore where are you all day
i go to college i thought you knew
do you want to get some coffee
i do not drink coffee daddy and this is not what we should be talking about
i am seeing your play tonight remember
why do you need a radio
so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer
that is completely crazy
is it
do not talk like that how prominent what are you implying
she is doing like those iranians i divorce thee i divorce thee i divorce thee
if lawyers for the mob are called controversial why are divorce lawyers called prominent
because they get outstanding settlements and mother is determined that this time there s no turning back
because you refuse to believe she is serious you have always refused
you are too young to be studying criminal behavior it is making you obsessive
do not call her mother all the time it makes her sound tragic and unforgiving what happened to mom
i did not turn her into mother you did
laurel tickets are all set i double checked
thanks daddy but i just need one mother s not going
opening night
rogan laurel you also have a rogan lillian she will not need it sell it
take it yourself take a date
and you blame me it is because we never talk let s talk
i have a class i am late
can we talk later will you be at the party
look i am sorry you keep running into dishonest men but you are only eighteen we can still turn it around
except i will not have a father anymore
will i believe you when you tell me something
i see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor
why will not you tell me your name
i am willing to tell you my name
you have to tell me what you thought of the play
first you tell me
what else
packs an emotional wallop
what else
we are strangers in the night the last thing we want is honesty
what do we want
mystery deception
deception is not something i personally consider sexy
that is sexy
knowing who a person is down deep
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking
yes and no more evasive tactics
it is your best play nicky
see daddy
i have seen it twice i went back tonight to be sure it is a brave and honest piece of work
what else
see daddy
your father said you might be here
we stranded five runners in the first two innings this will come back to haunt us
i want to be fair minded nicky
all right that is been going on
i have been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer

lillian says it once a week why does not he come live with us
you know the answer to that

frankie lazzaro coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media children see this they think you are the secretary of the treasury
it is a complicated subject
your problem is you take the easy way out losing is easy
winning is easy losing is complicated it is a lifetime s work
it looked extremely rocky for the boston nine that day
you are afraid to risk believing believe in them believe in your self take a risk it will humanize you as a person
say it and you will believe it life is good say it
i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments
then say it
life is good
because god loves a winner
washed away
because life is good

please papa i have a secret path
moses moses seradungu
can i help you
i am looking for moses seradungu s room
what is his room number
i do not know
ken it is bruce listen we have got a nibble on the pendleton financing
fifty we need seventy five
you tell them if they come up to seventy five i will cut them in on the crystal lake package
do not tell me you are still thinking of buying casa de psycho
chain saws
you want to put in chain saws
i do not think the people who live around here would like that very much
do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety eight percent in the last ten years
no but
and do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks crystal lake is filled with corpses
beautiful trees sturdy trunks lots of branches we can do some great logging up here
logging we will need an environmental impact study for that
jesus christ
just a deer mister biller part of the local wildlife
i think we are lost
you have a map
i did not think there were any houses up here
structure might be salvageable let s see what the interior looks like
mister biller now that we can see the lake i think we should follow the shoreline to
there does not seem to be any water damage kind of cozy actually
i really think we should go back
who is this that is going on
this is janet davenport i am the realtor
i do not know
what about that other guy
other guy
janet are you okay are you there
he he is here
oh my god this is his house we are in his fucking house
janet goddamnit that is going on
i am not sure i would call them murder exactly more like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand
i seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder one charges
quite a circus
three where is my client
your client is being booked right now he will be in cell five
i thought that was ted bundy
that is right it it came right out of his chest
who s chest
now i think the video store s open for another couple of hours let s go
so why cannot jason get a fair trial
because everyone knows he is guilty
you think that is going to work
you watch this garbage
zombie sluts from beyond the grave
he is fucking nuts
doesnit sleep
insomnia not unusual for someone in his situation not to mention he is a bed wetter
he wets the bed
nurses that is why i went into medicine
this sexual obsession of yours have you considered going into therapy yourself
so what are you saying that he did not kill all those people
do not get me wrong i do not care but the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do
i do not rationalize anything i am his lawyer he is my client that is all
not much here jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia that is about it
so jason does not sleep how does that help us
insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes delusions
if we could prove that jason suffers from this disorder and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition
not guilty by reason of insanity case closed
how long will he need to be asleep
there s a pizza place over on market
cute waitresses
that is open to debate
there s nothing to see here he sleeps we record it that is all that happens
i think i am onto something joe
me too i am drunk
see this
yeah what is it
it is as though there were two people in that room both of them asleep both of them dreaming
that does not make sense
add it to the list
i do not suppose i can go back to the university and chase young coeds again pretend this whole thing never happened
great 	when can you do it
you are not going to be there
you saw him
what are you doing
this is jason s rem pattern and this is the boy s rem pattern they are identical
if i am right this happened before the krueger murders in springwood that means that jason might have been krueger s first victim
where is he going
i do not know but i think he is pissed
you know how to use one of those
i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid
krueger s in the real world maybe he is mortal like us
and if he is not
so you think it might counteract krueger s ability to make us hallucinate
ten cc s of this shit and you will not be dreaming about anything
how long will the effect last
about ten minutes
ten minutes
we are down to seven minutes
are you all right
what happened where is jason
bree honey please we are waiting for someone
arlyn he just wanted to ask some questions something you could help us about
honey a couple of years ago with jane and frankie jane sent me a dumper
please if he sees you he will not come
arlyn just tell me did jane have a dumper one of her regular johns
what about him yes
why she is a junkie
enjoy well
it is good to see you well could we do it first and then just talk
sure dear yes
maybe this was not just a trick maybe you are in danger of real love real involve
i do not love him
do not belong
well i have to close up now
look could i use your phone
yes indeed
look i almost killed my i almost killed someone
miss daniel be sensible you find another place till we get things cleaned up
oh well that should not take you more than another oh two and a half or three years should it
a few more days we know who did this
so do i
arlyn and jane commited suicide he said they commited suicide
now there s a picture i would like you to
you said someone killed them you said you know who you said that
well we are pretty
why is not he locked up
we do not want to just lock him up we want a conviction we wanted him to do something more
is that why klute did not tell me
i guess he figured it was better
what was better i made better bait
no that is not
i do not have to look at anything i do not have
oh no
like for you to look for the man
cannot we talk together reasonably just ordinarily i know you are expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but believe me do you believe me
yes all right
you have no idea what i am talking about
yes jane mckenna s book i could make a phone call
i am not going to hurt you absolutely i am not
i am sorry i am just frightened yes
excuse me miss daniel
i said yes i see
oh no i do not think
what is it
what about
my name s john klute
you said that
will you let me ask you some questions
is it the shakedown hon you picked a loser i just do not have it
could i ask some questions
company outing or picnic or something like that
you remind me of my uncle
but you cannot say that dumper was tom grunemann
is that how you get most of your dates someone gives your name to someone else
most of them
is that how you met the dumper someone else gave
how would i remember
how else do you meet them pimps
i have some names the police gave me frank ligourin will you tell me what
look i am sure this will amuse you too ilia trying to get away from all that
gee i hope this does not make my cold any worse
tell me about frank ligourin
you have changed your mind you do want to play
tell me about acting what are you doing tomorrow where do you go
i go on rounds
rounds what are they do not watch me keep talking
well do you think it was him
what do you think
cannot you get him
maybe if you tell me the things you have not
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper frank sent me on it
do you know where he got the dumper
he never told me
what did you expect frankie still has a good string three girls figure three hundred a week from each
did not he tell you what you wanted
it did not go anywhere but that is not why
about the dumper did not he tell you that
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper
i thought you were going back to the apartment
oh golly oh just what i have always dreamed of dirty phone calls how come
you told me what you could i guess i am through with your part of it
is there anything more i could
i do not see anything do you
what are you gonna do next
try some other ways
what do i do meanwhile wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me
and i do not think that was tom
you said it was
hey but did we get to you klute a little
yeah you got to me
us city folks the sin the glitter the wickedness
it is kind of late
oh do not be a doo doo
arlyn page
did she and jane mckenna know each other
frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his travel time
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too
arlyn had a very big habit heroin she is the one who started frank she is strung out now you will not find her
that is the matter
what the hell do you think s the matter i could wait for you someplace
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann
then you do not need me
just let me know when you are going out and where
what if i go out on tricks you wanna come along you could sit and read the national geographic
how can you do it to yourself
i do not get you
ligourin how could you do it
no no you are right i am sorry he uses women he lets them kill themselves is that how you want it
arlyn was a junkie i am not on junk
we did this before
no well all right but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right
is that all you have to say
you and i a relationship
i was wondering what that was
oh jesus oh jesus
oh look what he did in them
listen to me it is all right i have been expecting something
right back at the start right
go down in my room
ah schmendrick that is the scam
those were police laboratory people they have been over the apartment
where would you spend last night
with trina
i called trina
maybe i was not there when you called
bree that is actually happened it was not that bad
how do you know how bad it was
why could not you stay here with me
hey look officer i can explain everything it was just you know everything all of a
please i said i do not want you to do this
well suppose i had not come downstairs would you just have folded up and sneaked away
no i was going to come up i wanted to ask you to marry me
you wanted to or you are
i am
look yes i mean thanks but do not you think we better be realistic
about what
look at me i am pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned and dear god i would tear your heart out
how can you not think so you know the things i can do
you do not believe that either do you why cannot you see my side
can i carry something for you to the car will you kiss me
she would not be reliable anyhow a narcotics addict
all right suppose it was not tom grunemann where does that get you
it is where it does not get me i have got nothing left that connects to anything
then close the case
i better keep looking
where how
i could try arlyn page again she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer not tom you said the dumper was clearly not tom
i am flying back out to pennsylvania friday i will fill them in on things
sorry we had to meet here but i am pressed for time
well there s a couple
i read your report i had to go along with it the idea of this being a wild goose chase tom being nowhere around
i am on my way to chicago very important meeting tonight well any new developments
yeah two things pete that
you said trask was arranging laboratory work police laboratory anything from that
yeah it was not tom
i am sorry i do not understand
it was not tom that broke in the room
some mistake perhaps that
no no mistake pete it does not prove who it was but proves it was not tom
you must be discouraged
not too bad this brings back that dumper in the picture
that who
dumper the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew
you said he was no possible connection with tom the page girl told you that not tom
someone s been doing all these things
you were hired to look for tom not someone
i cannot follow you
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckenna s list of clients
no it is ridiculous this has nothing to do with tom grunemann
i can talk it over possibly i can get the money when are you meeting the man
tomorrow evening nine east river drive and 73rd street
suppose i meet you there a half hour before
just send me a money order
john how are you
i will be sending you on a report tonight
it is a beautiful day in tuscarora i do not envy you that humidity in the city
would you like to know that is in it the report
i am sure the fbi and the police explored that possibility
no they never did really but that is what i am going to recommend the next step unless something
have you discussed this with them
it is in the report
do they have the report have you discussed it with them
all right
thank you goodbye john
i have always respected bree i would like to make something clear
i have just got a few
two years ago sorry
they tell me you use narcotics could i bring someone around to look at your arms
ok a family matter between the girls i had two other cows two other girls besides bree
i would like to talk with jane mckenna
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it
not unusual
did she talk about him to you
about his letters that is all she remembered quite violent material i would say obsessive a quite sick man but that is not unusual either
klute with a k k l u
are you with plant security sergeant
town police
then how are you involved
i know tom grunemann
you knew the subject thomas grunemann how well
we grew up together kids
marital problems in general indicates possibly am i right sergeant
everybody s got some i guess
but if cable killed grunemann why would he get you hired to look for grunemann
because he knew i could not leave the case alone and this way at least he would keep track of it and me
that is a lot of people to die unknown
he is right you know waiting for the pusher she would tell you anything
that is how the other one died you know in the water
think this is our guy
i do not know it looks familiar to me
but what reason could he have what possible reason
unless he was involved with grunemann s disappearance
i knew tom never wrote that letter
we have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior but there s no evidence of murder there s not even a body
gov want to leave me that one how come he got to play with this one anyway
it is damn lucky you did not have the dossier on cable here
are you closing the case
private investigation you mean yes sir of course you are entitled and there s some very competent
klute knew tom he has a great many ideas about the case
i am dr alvarez judge atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet
where is the child
he is in his room playing
mr kramer do you ever have sex in here with anyone

i guess about the same kind of things you do
did you watch i dream of jeannie
was there apple juice when you were little
yeah there was apple juice

are you introducing the question of negligence here counselor
yes your honor
i see well you will have to do better than that do you have any affidavits to support negligence
i do not your honor however
this is an isolated incident counselor unless you can prove otherwise
does the witness deny the injury took place
no counselor i am going to over rule you on this line of questioning
now then mrs kramer would you tell the court how long you were married
six years
and would you describe those years as happy
the first couple yes but after that it became increasingly difficult
mrs kramer did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex husband
no i did not
tell me mrs kramer are you employed at the present time
yes i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer
and what is your present salary
mrs kramer do you love your child
yes very much
mr kramer why did you set up residence in new york
because my son is here and his father is here as a mother i do not want my child to be separated from his father
objection your honor the answer is to be generous very vague
no further questions thank you mrs phillips
objection your honor counsel is harassing the witness
objection your honor counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings
now then mr o connor how long did ted kramer work for you
eight almost nine years
and how did you find his work
it was good he was a hard worker a lot of drive a real hustler
what what do you mean i do not understand
mr kramer nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus
look you do not understand i need a job i have got a kid and
call up the people at j walter thompson set up an appointment at four
mis ter kramer it is almost four now it is the friday before christmas nobody is going to want to

my name s leonard
did teddy send you

mr shelby you know all about sammy and you decided that he was faking
mrs jankis the company s position is not that sammy is faking anything just that his condition cannot be shown
i am not interested in the company position mr shelby i want to know your honest opinion about sammy
we should not even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal
i am not appealing the decision
i believe that sammy should be physically capable of making new memories
thank you
how can you read that again
it is good
you have read it a hundred times
i enjoy it
yeah but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next
beg my forgiveness beg my wife s forgiveness before i blow your brains out
i am leonard shelby i am from san francisco and i am
that is who you were you do not know who you are
shut your mouth

i am not gonna help you kill this guy if that is what
we cannot just walk him out tied up and bleeding
how would ya get him in here in the first place

we probably ought to take his car you know teach him a lesson
shut it teddy
easy for you to say you have got the jag
i will ride with him you follow
so was he scared
fuck you we shoulda taken his car
that is wrong with this one

unfinished business
lenny as a buddy let me inform you your business here is very much finished you are still here because of natalie
what do you mean bad news
she is gonna use you to protect herself
yeah well maybe she will make it you is that it you worried she will use me against you
she could not
she has no idea who i am
happy now
how long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions
what sort of questions
the sort of questions you should be asking yourself

my wife s death i used to work in insurance we were well covered
i did not sell
i know you investigated maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself
yeah well thanks for the advice

i do not know see i have this condition
this is a drug deal
i dunno your wife surviving the assault her not believing about your condition the doubt tearing her up inside the insulin
that is sammy not me i told you about sammy
like you have told yourself over and over conditioning yourself to believe learning through repetition
sammy let his wife kill herself sammy ended up in an institution
sammy was a con man a faker
i never said he was faking i never said that
i was wrong that is the whole point sammy s wife came to me and
my wife was not diabetic
she was not diabetic you think i don t			 know my own wife what the fuck is wrong		 with you
i guess i can only make you believe the things you want to be true huh like ol 		 jimmy down there
what difference does it make whether he			 was your guy or not
it makes all the difference
why you are never going to know
yes i will
no you will not
somehow i will know
you will not remember
when it is done i will know it will be different
you probably

one considers her timing of course getting nicked within a week of the plane going down suggestive even borderline suspicious but hardly conclusive

checkpoint charlie plus 30 altitude minus two zero thousand airspeed one seven niner knots

now here s the way it is going to work wallis the shares outstanding are
damn just when it was about to get interesting
what you got there mate
well do you disagree with that
not at all but how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site
ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar big bloke ginger hair they are into something
wrong all we have got to worry about is ambrose nyah will take care of nyah
it is billy
ambrose obviously got these from nekhorvich on the plane
so ambrose has bellerophon and mccloy s got chimera
package away in five four three two one
billy i think we got a problem nyah s on the wing up early billy do you copy
exactly where is she
we are due to take off
range is two kay
there she is i got visual
that is it that is it that is it
and the check s in the mall
i am booted up go ethan
say again sounds like you are saying she is in the building
she is in the elevator heading toward ethan
how much longer before you can reach him
how are we doin then
he should have have killed the virus in the incubation area nyah s exited the elevator on the same level as the lab
what can we do mate
do you know me
no should i
no you just looked as if you did
no just as if i would like to
oh well i think that can be arranged
not tonight bad timing sorry
look it is either you or the rent and i do not mind telling you it is not an easy choice
what if i pay the rent
uh huh
what are you doing here
think you are the only one who can pick a lock
would you mind if i am on top
right where is it
where is the bloody
torque wrench
this is very disconerting
i would not do that
at least you walked
if you were not going to let me get away with it why did you let me go thru with it
working under adverse conditions highly adverse conditions
sounds smashing i am in muchacho mi carro por favor now be serious you could not possibly want me off tonight s performance
you are apologizing for me quite the gentleman
hi would you mind slowing down
pull over and listen to me will you just listen
listen to what
i need your help and i thin you can use mine
your help what are you talking about
scotland yard interpol every dutch authority i can make them go away
that is you name
ethan hunt
awfully short notice
care to wait a decent interval
when they have got your recruiting technique not a thing
oh well this is not exactly by the book
they have got a book for this
not revealing information does not necessarily make someone a liar
that is not the point in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you do not
which is
so where did i got right
you are not a liar or you are an awfully good one this thing these blokes pinched
well then what i am i doing here i assume i am meant to be some sort of thief to catch a thief
spoken like a spook you ever afraid
ask a question you get an answer
damn you are beautiful
that is the population of seville any idea
five six hundred thousand
there s nearly 2 million in london
and six billion in the world
that is lot of people out there how many of them i wonder are capable of something like that
not that it matter much but i seem to recall you staying something like i was hoping we could work together
this was not what i had in mind nyah
go and insinuate yourself back into sean s life
i would like a little more conviction
so would i but it is not mine to give
you have either got it or you do not let your conscience be your guide
but i do not have a conscience i am a bloody thief
i do not
someone in possession of all the facts are you telling me i have to do this
generally i do not favor coercing someone not when there s a chance my life could end up in their hands
and that is the only reason
can you think of a better one
not me i was just hoping you might or that somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical
what would not make him suspicious
this does not seem to be accomplishing much
well i mean it is not a total loss it is keeping a very capable thief off the street
before you are
how can you possibly i have got to get right on the plane i am leaving now
you do not trust me
oh i do but as we know i am a very poor judge of character
how is it going everything okay
just like old times
just like old times
we know him he is over your left shoulder looking right at you as you go on
michael his driver s an aussie new to me then there s the blokes in the annex at the back of the house
ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them thirty seven million on the london times that is that about
where do i meet you
betting table twelve off the paddock nyah are you up to this
i managed
i want you out of there
nyah you have done more than enough even the best of snake charmers get bit
i want you out of australia i do not know how much more plainly i can put it
easy easy easy shhh
are you okay
i am now get me out of here just get me out of here
ethan you know what frightens me most when i am with him the thought of never seeing you how are we getting out of here
nyah it is very important not do anything to alarm ambrose
what did you think you were doing
you who do not have a conscience
no should i
sorry i did not let you know where i was
do not be would not be on vacation if you did
well you are sorry and i am sorry
why did you phrase it like that
like what
you are sorry and i am sorry
if he did not want to go anywhere without me how did you get him on the flight
what did you think of him
you know we had reservations about each other is not it a little late in the day to be asking me that
so there s one thing we know ambrose does not
whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it
sean feels he has not done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground
right now only ambrose knows that
in any case you have got to recover chimera and bring it to us
in order to do that i have got to figure out how he plans to make money with it
is where miss hall comes in
and then what
then makes sure she continues to see him gets him confide in her and report to you
she is got no training for this kind of thing
i do not think i can get her to do it
yes i believe that is right
but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera
you mean that leaves miss hall
something else
are not you even curious about why she did it
sorry ethan i do not quite know where to begin any suggestions
you would like me to conduct my own debriefing
why not you have done just about everything else on this operation
yes i gathered as much
and that appears to have been destroyed it also contained the anti virus bellerophon
i do
where is she now by the way do you know
i do not no exactly
well hunt what are your plans
not sure some sort of vacation i will let you know where i am going
you keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it doctor
well yes i suppose i am a bit anxious
they are ready and waiting you will soon be with old friends
i am with an old friend now dmitri
sorry it could not be under happier circumstances
he was quite a man did he know before the end you two had succeeded
yes he knew just
not in time to save him
it seems we have a problem dmitri
i am fine and you
it is the transponder
put in the coordinates and let s get a visual the visuals are not coming up
that simple huh
luther get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on bruny island last month including photos of the victims
ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope put it in his inner left jacket pocket
left jacket pocket
roger that
confirm left jacket pocket
left jacket pocket confirmed
i do not know but nekhorvich was not a manic get me a twenty on nyah
she must still be on the property
ambrose got bellerophon from nekhorvich on the plane but he did not get the chimera virus
yeah why else would he come back to australia if he had them both he could sell them anywhere
i kill chimera at biocyte and he is sitting on a cure without a disease
sorry that it a biocyte facility their storage structure
let s start from the inside out
now how to get in there
luther i am looking at security
luther say again
she is on the north head bluff approaching the cliffs one klick away
so what did he say
a visit from an old friend
it was in the bloody papers on the telly that is this about gradski
you have bellerophon
do i
you took it all of it and what if i need it
if my my my the five hundred people on bruny island that you deliberately infected with chimera needed it as well
oh please how was i to know they had to be treated with bellerophon within twenty hours
more or less
yes you are
what was the color of tim s belt
the style of fighting that tim studied did not believe in belts
is that a fact well then grace could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that tim was schooled in
point of fact were not tim s hands registered as lethal weapons
that means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife am i correct on that point
what kind of pies do you have
apple pecan cherry and key lime
which do you recommend
the key lime is great but it is an acquired taste
i have not had a key lime pie in ten years
what did you think then
i wondered how long it would be before we would get to be alone together and i wondered if i could wait that long
did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room
have not you been listening to a fucking word i said oh i am sorry can i say fuckin i cannot can i
try to keep it to a minimum
naw she do not mind
are we in a big hurry
by all means knock yourself out
has not it
looked like an interview to me
who is we
the prison board and the doctors who examined them
were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the knoxs mental state asked to are examine them
using the same doctors is not common practice
thank you sir
who is not
you been following the news coverage
they have been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries
susanville soledade
they have killed a shitload of inmates and guards
lobotomy bay
you have heard of it
so how do i fit into this scheme
the public loves you jack you do not mind if i call you jack do you
by all means
i see
who s the song bird
because they would not give them their blessing for marriage
looks like we got a mexican standoff
slide the shotgun over here put your hands behind your head put your forehead on the floor
or what you will wound me i can blow you in half and you know it
she is in the holding cell on this floor
how come you never talk
she was born without a tongue
there s a chocolate cream filled in there
yeah ya see i ordered that special
tough titty it is mine now
you guys stay on your bellies
how is it
not good
do you have a back up
it is video
the episode we did on mickey and mallory was one of our most popular ones
how about ted bundy ever do one on him
yes yours got the larger nielson share
good yuppie piece of shit
what i would like to do
how about manson
manson beat you
she does not talk
not to anybody she sings
mickey how do you feel about cross examining grace mulberry
okay now before we get started here there s a few things we have to get clear about
all right mickey
sorry about that
do not worry about it
we are about ready to go here are you ready
so mickey tell us what you do for fun
much obliged what do i do for fun do you want to know what i do for fun or what i did for fun
do you miss mallory
of course i miss mallory she is my wife i have not seen her in a long time what a stupid question
then was it worth it
was what worth it
was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie yeah it was
tell me about the purity
it is not that easy wayne donuts and a smoke only get you so far you are gonna have to do your job
okay okay i will buy that we will move on and come back later
i am sure we will
describe mallory
describe mallory okay she is pretty she is got blonde hair two eyes two feet two hands ten fingers
do not play dumb with me mickey you know what i mean describe mallory that is up here that is in here
that is indescribable
well riddle me this batman how do you feel about the fact that you are never gonna see mallory again
says who
says the united states of america
i could go for a coke
donut get your camera see if it is broke
let me check on scott he is hurt bad
yeah we have a van
where is it parked
out front
this is crazy you cannot escape like this
probably not but we are gonna give it the old college try
on average forty million
every week by forty million people i am a respected journalist have you won any awards
are you kidding the golden globe the edward r murrow award
we ai not got all fucking day
c mon c mon let s hurry this up
just wait one fucking minute
developed between the three of us we are kindda in this together do not ya think
wait you cannot kill me mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale
i cannot go i am too fucked up
no fucking way no fucking way
if they stay they will catch you and they do not have to catch you
no fucking way
yeah baby
why cannot they just shake hands and be friends
they cannot because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the knoxs so you may as well make the first move
and they made the first move
i admire them
through the power of the simple word
and a snake eye glare
and a snake eye glare arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him
he had the edge the mind s edge
mickey and mallory have that edge
only on a much grander scale
they have hypnotized the nation
that is the mickey and mallory way
that is the way of the world
they are shocking the world into remembering the primal law
just for fun i guess
and then mallory stops mickey and says hey these are the brothers hun
mickey stops sawing on my leg and says oh my god i am your biggest fan
apparently they have seen all our films
they were especially influenced by conquering huns of neptune
so mallory calls 911 and they took off
i want two men stationed in that tier and i want men with rifles all along the walkway
here s the layout of the laundry room
what do you think pitney how much explosives do you think that they really have in there
it is hard to say capt n
take a wild stab
i will say enough to destroy this wing
the entire wing
how immediate is immediately

thanks and what are
rob thanks for everything this is really happening i never thought
whoa deja vu
dorothy parker
you like her
i love the way she writes
not the happiest of souls art is a form of catharsis and love is a permanent flop
but i think she wanted to be happy that is why she wrote i mean she was still writing about love right
true i guess she had not completely given up hope are you sure you are seventeen
sure why
because seventeen year olds do not like writers from the 30 s they do not even like people in their 30 s
hey josie hold on you have been hiding something from me
oh i do not think so
your writing it is amazing josie you are really talented and far less depressing than dorothy parker
thank you

oh no no no no no see my family we do not go to college we just go right into sheep herding
josie you owe it to yourself to go for your writing you are a natural
this seat taken
you are afraid of the ferris wheel
actually it is more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me
oh right the spiderman incident
you remember that story
okay this is okay smooth can i ask you something do you think i tell too many stories in class
you do seem to have passion in the classroom
you have to say that you are my student

that is really what we all need right someone to sit up on the wall with us
yeah to watch the world go by
our penguin right

oh my god i almost forgot i got you a meeting with the admissions guy from dartmouth
what but i was not even going to go to college

perhaps i do not take it so lightly
where are you staying in vancouver royal it is pretty crowded you know

a very small service it does not even ask for thanks how long for
i do not know
nice room balcony and everything lovely view too
very nice mitchell turns
no thanks
thank you
suppose i had not known that immigration inspector had not put in a good word for you
dine and dance tonight i have got fifty bucks to throw away
not tonight
that is the matter
i am not in the mood for dining and dancing
we have some nice places around vancouver
i am sure you have
well how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o clock a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there
i have not been invited
the brush off huh

if you change your mind about the cocktail party or anything else give me a buzz
betty this is margo west she wants to meet you miss mayfield
i think i would like to dance
please be a little more careful how you talk mr mitchell
i think you are drunk
that is the matter baby do not you like being kissed
good evening miss
how soon can i get a plane to seattle
i am afraid there s nothing more tonight miss unless you charter a plane
they might think i was running away from something
good morning can i do something for you
i am miss mayfield is mr campbell here
merely for our records miss mayfield it is usual for the guests who come here for the first time
you can have the table yourself if you would rather i am only killing time
no please
sit down then we often have a double up here
your liquor laws
a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here he is holding open house i was up there too noisy bored
i see
it might be worth a martini to you
i do not need it that badly i do not enjoy crashing other people s parties
it is open house no crashing involved anybody in the hotel s welcome
you do not sound as if you liked him very much
no not very well and i like his friends even less but if you really want a good dry martini
as i said before
you are not paying for this it is quite enough that you let me sit at your table
i never pay for anything they just keep me here to amuse the guests
and do you amuse the guests
no are you really going to drink that stuff
you are drinking it
i can be talked out of it as a matter of fact i would like a dry martini myself
would it make you anymore amusing
whatever you say
do you think i do not
thanks for the fresh air that felt good
you are sure mr brandon will not mind
i know it is a littler late for an apology
much too late
he got in here how
no and i have never fired a gun in my life are not you supposed not to touch it
they will know whether he killed himself
i do not
how did you meet him
on a train he said he lived here and he offered to make a reservation for me
nice of him
he knew the immigration officer he eased himself in
he was a great boy for that what else
go ahead if you want to it does not matter
you tried to run away
there was not any plane
want a spike in it
bad enough
he could hardly help suspecting you
what time is it
quarter after one why
dance tonight
let s not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us
certainly not to me
is this the best you can do
want to dance
dance here
why not
they know you here know your name
that man over there he was in the hotel lobby
i did not notice him
we walked right passed him he is following us
killaine s not that sort of guy he said no he meant no
then he is got to be a detective
could not be
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby
absolutely sure
he is a fellow with a very hard knee and he knows how to use it
you do not know who he is
he is not a cop a cop would not have kneed me
no matter there s nothing i can do about it
anything i can do about it
take me home and forget you ever saw me that is a silly remark is not it
it still does not matter if i kiss you
nothing matters
that is the second round i have lost tonight that fellow hurt me
so have i
it sounds like a fair location could you be a little more exact
i am in the hudson bay company s store that man last night the one that followed me
cant be too close for me right across the street from it suits me anything else listed
i hated to go to that place i almost went to the police station instead
no percentage in that
they are going to arrest me
i know killaine has a warrant
that was not why i called you why did i hope when i had not any right to hope
how bad is it bad enough for
take me where i have not the courage to take myself
this must have cost a fortune
it did but it never paid off until now i ought to be back within an hour we cannot leave until near dark anyway
do you have to leave the note
i would still go through even if i ended up in jail
you would not like it i have been there
see anything
i can still see the shoreline the moon is rising
i decided i did not want a drink i am beginning to wonder
wonder what
if you are doing all this just for me
that and the fun of it
i thought you had to be back to the hotel to leave my my note
funny i never thought of you that way you were so close too we were all pretty stupid about you
including killaine
in a way
if it was an accident you could have told the truth
so could you but our records were a little against us
no i paid him off
he will come back they always come back when you give them money
not this one and not mitchell
you will never make it you have out smarted yourself
it was not the time or place do not worry about the note baby i am playing for my neck now
mitchell was dead enough
magruder does
would i want to
every day of your life you will want me you will never get over it every time you see your face in the mirror
i think you mean that
do you think i was faking
yes miss
i would like a dry martini very dry please
sorry miss beer and ale only canadian law
beer well all right
beer or ale miss
ale i do not mind
mrs west is a very emotional woman
i was born in new york city i grew up and here i am
i will have to know a little more than that
please answer my question
you did not ask a question you made a speech
that is an evasion and you know it
who told you i was married
your family coat of arms mr killaine
regimental seaforth highlanders
i am sorry
stop saying you are sorry i want information not regrets
where is you get it
an unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that
why do not you arrest me and be done with it
care for a stroll outside beautiful morning the air is like wine the sky is a deep blue
deep blue i would call it grey blue
we would not have met at all
true i was a bit irritable last night i apologize
you were a galahad compared to some cops i have known
you have had dealings with the police before
who has not one way or another
but not in the investigation of a major crime i hope
is it a crime
we are 98 per cent certain mitchell was murdered there are a lot of reasons was he very drunk when you last saw him
you were there when i last saw him
i will find out you know perhaps not today perhaps not tomorrow but in the end i will find out
the police always do do not they
i would not make you talk about it my job is the death of marry mitchell why cannot you give me your confidence
you or the vancouver police department
you will not tell me who you are you will not even give me a chance to help you
nobody can help me you least of all
if i understand what you meant by that
you understand perfectly
then there is not much i can do is there
this is not a very good place to talk
i do not want to talk
i expected nothing else
i might be able to save you if i knew enough
you would not even try there must be some copper in you or you would not be an inspector
points very straight to her
he looks at the girl looks into her eyes
very ridiculous
that is my hard luck i am man enough to tell you about it and not be sorry
what do your friends call you the ones that know you well and like you very much
they call me jeff
looking for peanuts i suppose
so mitchell had handled it afterwards brandon picked it up there s no indication you handled it
i always wear gloves when i shoot people a bad joke but better than tears
time s up i am off the case
they will only find someone else who will not be so kind
that is something i cannot spare you but i will not do it myself
you have got a couple of hours maybe
to do what
i cannot answer that
what will they do to you
that is they are business can i drop you somewhere
i have been a soldier too there is a difference a policeman like a judge has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds
what proper grounds you cannot be in love with me you hardly know me i am not in love with you
i know that
but even if you were in love with me
there s an empty taxi across the street if you are so anxious take it he will know the way to the police headquarters
not sometimes always just because it is the hard way you are that kind of man jeff
he could have killed me a dozen times you would never have known
we know everything
no jeff you do not he is not a murderer i tell you he is not a murderer
but i tell you if you would only understand
good morning mr brandon

and without much discrimination
leave that one lay
i am sorry this thing has just knocked me silly how long do we have to wait for this police character
until he comes he is a nice guy you have met him
all right let s see the buzzer
that is a buzzer
so you are not a cop
me a cop what made you think that mr brandon
who told you my name
how are your teeth getting along
it goes with this cold houses and warm drinks the effete englishman
that is what i like about cocktail parties everyone is so perfectly natural
how is life treating you
the usual grind
round of golf saturday
would it have helped if i would knocked him down
hardly who s the girl
somebody mitchell picked up on the train i do not even know her name
she does not look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train
thank you
on miss mayfield s balcony beside the chaise i picked it up do not ask me why i ought to know better
could be
it was lying where on the balcony
near his right hand about a foot away perhaps more good heavens one does not use a tape measure
how about a cup of coffee
in case you want to have us followed
i do not
time for a little chat
if it does not take too long drink
thanks lovely view you have have not you
i never notice the view after the first week
i would fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap wonderful thing money is remember what somerset maugham said about it
i would not know
money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others very appealing especially to a poor man
could we discuss that some other time
sure let s discuss betty mayfield how long since you saw her
a couple of hours
i have a warrant for her arrest
would that make me a heel
you would be breaking the law
does not answer the question
the only answer i have for you
do not kid me you do not think she murdered mitchell
it could have been an accident
that could be told
not if she knew she would not be believed
and old man clarendon he had a motive too margo and her money
mitchell was killed down here how could clarendon get in to do it or margo for that matter
how could mitchell after that act he put on up here is it likely she would let him in
romeo in reverse uh uh no sale killaine
you do not buy it okay so i still want betty mayfield where is she
no more for me thanks remember what i said i cannot interfere with the law
you forgetting the gag line killaine the police do not take anything for granted
i am afraid they do far too often so long
you do a lot of real estate trading brandon
now and then mostly just for the fun of it
i tried it once i lost my shirt
i buy my shirts by the dozen fortunately
you asked me where it all came from
hello mitchell having fun
that is the matter baby do not you like me anymore
do me a favor mitchell find yourself a nice secluded park bench
did i do something wrong
i would not know just do it somewhere else there is such a thing as good manners
how would you know brandon
want to walk out or get thrown out
you do not throw guests out brandon
good afternoon mr campbell
mr mitchell
a little something on account perhaps
rather more than a little something mr mitchell
i think we would better discuss this in my office mr mitchell
i am getting positively haggard in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair
what are you doing here
i do not think you locked your door
do not be a fool i loved him he was not worth it but i loved him
and now that he is safe from all other women you can go on loving him
you nasty sardonic
that is not enough
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun you lied it was obvious
he saw my face too
so he did but he has not told you what he saw i have
they will arrest that girl everything points to her
one of these days you are going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you have cut your throat
how clumsy i would never forgive myself good night my dear
you could have got in that room just as you got in here how do i know you did not kill larry
with what motive
nastiness you are nasty with words why would not you be nasty with deeds once in a while you hated him and i know why
mr clarendon have you ever seen this before
i am sorry inspector i do not know much about
recently then
no not recently i am sure of that
i need not keep you any longer mr clarendon
not a floater only just dead
you are the waterfront specialist find out about it i have got a murder to investigate
you have two murders to investigate this man s head was beaten in and there s nothing in his pockets
and do not get too logical driscoll in police business it does not work i wish it did but it doesn t
got a moment inspector
i have got a year or a second i am not sure which
swimming with his hat on that is original
if you would seen the blood on his head and some body had to carry him out to sea
i understand pity to mess up a nice clean boat
send that
would you
catch me at the vancouver royal if it is important
thanks inspector what are your orders about this wire to san francisco
i am looking for mr brandon
i have an appointment with him right here right now
go live in a tent
it will be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet
mr brandon could not be here he might have left something for you what would it look like
one of those nice long manila envelopes sealed not too fat not too thin
what do i get for it
you get it is brother
i need a receipt sign your name across the flap
open it and count it
you in charge here
i knew him he was easy to dislike poor chap
i supposed you knew her too inspector
pearl handled 25 automatic uh no it is a belgian gun 6 6 mm
this make of gun throws a shell backwards high and to the right the chaise is only about four feet from the wall
so the shell ought to have gone over
unless the gun was slanted up
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer
right a clean deduction from observed facts they have got to be simple once in a while inspector
i will know when i find it
g g market one eight four two
gigi huh sounds french one of those fancy ladies must have been very fancy if he scratched her phone number in gold
that is pretty risky business inspector
not too hard is it
maybe we have been pretty dumb
was that about the right angle
i think so
where is the shell
such as
assume there is something to hid i go to a lot of trouble what do i do what would you do
do i know who lives down there
you can find out
do i know that she is out of the room likely to be out of it for some time
you can find out the first part the second part you have to take a chance on
pretty big chance huh
this is the shell what about the gun
and she did give him the chance the way it worked out
if she did not if luck was against him he wipes the gun off reaches the wall up there drops it on the chaise
no suicide
oh the coldstream guards do not you take your hat off in elevators
may you what
oh nothing
scotch and plain water i think
what about me
you knew mitchell pretty well did not you mrs west
i was in love with him which shows you the quality of my brains why do not you ask her about the gun
i shall from your knowledge of mitchell would you say he would be likely to commit suicide
anybody could commit suicide if he felt low enough i have felt it myself
remember that time did not i good morning mrs west does your visit here mean you have changed your mind
how did you know clarendon you cops never tell anybody anything do you
other people always know so much more than we know so much more than they are willing to tell us
you could not possible have traced it this soon not possibly
of course not thanks for telling me i have not seen mr clarendon
i am a fool
you did not play it for laughs last night
did you ever have a serious operation
not if it clears the air
it does may i go now
i will investigate mr clarendon s financial position
i do not understand
perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems
i am interested in who handled it
no doubt about that one
how about magruder
he checks too
that leaves two strangers
so far
try betty mayfield the mitchell case
mayfield she fit into this
you will have to take my word for it we do not make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison
this gun permit was issued to clark brandon
the card says so does not it
killaine this is mr mitchell senior young mitchell s father he just flew in from toronto
i have explained the situation to mr mitchell up to a point now about this mayfield girl
i hear she is a very pretty girl
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment
are you a policeman or a soft headed nincompoop
a little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either
it will not look pretty good on your record killaine where is the girl now
i do not know sir
well find out who s covering her
this girl is a murderess killaine
i disagree sir as inspector in charge of the case i have the right to form that opinion the right to act on it
ye have have ye
we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfield s toilet articles washington ought to teletype us within a few hours
and in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases does what she pleases
i think you would be entirely justified sir
but you still think she is innocent
there are people in this world who do not think a police badge is a badge of honor i am not one of them
get out of here
what are my orders sir
i am afraid you are not very glad to see me margo
with your charm how could i help it have a nice trip
so so
who s the girl
she is just a girl i met on the train you do not mind do you
why should i mind
you should not you washed me up very thoroughly
as thoroughly as i could it was not easy but you are helping me
margo darling you washed me up remember we are just friends you wanted it that way
she is very beautiful she is much younger than i am and she is rich i hope
rich i have not the faintest idea why
you ought to know why
i do not my hunch is she is just torn up an unhappy marriage i was able to do her a small favor
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared i was not lucky
you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police
i have a rough idea
you would go to jail for a long term
i have always been a heel i guess i always will be
you do not have to make a pose of it
it is the only pose i have left i am sunk broke i do not even have my hotel bill
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself
that is not very kind
that is this
what does it look like
how long have you had it
years why
it is against the law to cross the border with a gun the canadian police might like to know about this
you already have the checks darling
i did not mean it that way i am sorry
oh forget it clark brandon s throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening take me
of course
how about your new friend
i told you she is just
i am sorry i forgot about calling for you
it is quite unimportant mr mitchell after all you got what you wanted
be nasty
i have no intension of being nasty mr mitchell
she is beautiful and young no thank you
you are very attractive my dear and you look very unsophisticated

oh no problem at all i made the trip in three and a half hours
jack just make yourself at home would you like some coffee
do you mind if i ask why you do that it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic
five months of peace is just what i want
that is very good jack because eh for some people eh solitude and isolation
can of itself be a problem
not for me
how about your wife and son how do you think they will take to it
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job
i am intrigued
i do not believe they did
shut in together over long periods of time
well obviously some people can be
good morning jack i hope you have not been waiting too long
good glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen is your family having a look around
no my son s discovered the games room
yes very cosy for a family and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in
this is our colorado lounge
yes i believe they are based mainly on navajo and apache motifs
as a matter of fact we eh brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel
oh well this is our gold ballroom
we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably
by five o clock tonight you will never know anybody was ever here
bill i would like you to meet jack torrance
what time does the plane leave
eight thirty
please be calm ambassador de sade
war mongering bully do not think you are going to intimidate me
can i have a glass of water
certainly how about some breakfast
the food you would not put anything in it would you
do not be ridiculous
i have your word mister president
where are you trying to reach him
at his office in the capitol
if he is not there try 87 43 56
that is the meaning of this
i am sorry sub miniature photography is my hobby it is amazing what excellent en largements you can make from the negative
where is this thing
but finally one factor tipped the scales we received information from a very are liable source that your country was going to build one
that is preposterous we have no such program
the source was shall we say completely reliable
it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man
bah all you wanted to do was spy in our country
that is nonsense and you know it
i know nothing of the sort
surely you do not expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same
and now mister president i must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the premier
goodbye mister ambassador
excuse me mister president but you forgot to give me my camera back
premier belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie
do not you dare touch me what the devil do you think you are doing
i caught you red handed mister ambassador
give that back to me
mister president i cannot buy this malarkey they would not set the damn thing off why should they
you are absolutely right we would not no sane nation ever would that is why it was designed to trigger itself automatically
perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source
you mean you will tell us his name
my seven body orifices
that is right fella
major major i am colonel bat guano 701 battalion
come in come in peace on earth peace on earth yes
why are you saying that phrase over and over again
i think that just might be it although it could be riki tiki tavi
get a grip on yourself major
now snap out of it fella
what happened major some kind of private beef between the two of you
look i did not shoot him
we will have to leave that up to the c i would boys will not we major
look colonel i have got to talk to somebody at air command
do not worry major your rights will be fully protected
colonel do not you know that is going on
sure i do there was some kind of mutiny on the base and you killed general ripper
look general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd bomb wing to attack with h bombs
you must think i am an awful sap major just sit down fella and keep your hands on the desk
did not they tell you
now look i am picking up this ordinary telephone see hello hello nuts the lines must still be disconnected the general had us disconnect
look colonel maybe it is too late maybe they have sent air command in already but we have got to try to con tact somebody
you have wasted enough of my time fella
wait a minute the president that is it the president
what about the president
he wanted to talk to general ripper did not he
so what
that is government property major
i am sorry sir general schmuck is asleep and he is not taking calls until eight thirty
what is your name young lady
ceida pietraszkiewicz
what did you say
ceida pietraszkiewicz p i e t r a s z k i e w i c z
general schmuck
go back to sleep baby
colonel you are not drunk are you man
no sir
well that is ridiculous if the teleprinter and radio links are out of order just pick up a phone and pay for a call
does the threat board show anything
well mister president
general schmuck
may i be stupid enough to inquire why in hell the base commander of the 843d bomb wing did a thing like that
to be perfectly honest mister president we really are not sure
damn it damn it i have been telling you all for years you have got too damned many psychoes in the service
just a second sir he is got films of the war room in that thing
under a condition red alert the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies
well sir they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base
that is a very wise deduction general
under the circumstances general what would you think they should do
well i suppose penetrate the base by force
you see you knew the answer all the time general
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt mister president
what do you suppose is going to happen if general ripper s planes start bombing their targets
i did not speak to him sir but colonel bat guano was in command of the special service battalion so i would imagine he did
i want him upped to brigadier general and recomended for the would s c
combat operations center major mandrake speaking
this is general ripper speaking
yes sir
do you recognize my voice
why do you think i ask
i do not know sir we just spoke a few minutes ago
youddo not think i would ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important do you major
good has the wing confirmed holding at x points
yes sir
all right major i am putting the base on condition red
condition red
that is right i want this flashed to all section immediately
you are a good officer major mandrake you have a right to know it looks like we are in a shooting war
a shooting war
yes major this looks like it is going to be it
let me worry about that major i have still got my red line to the air command
that is right sir
we do not want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the president down do we
you are right sir
no calls from inside out no calls from outside in are even answered no calls
i understand sir nothing comes or goes without your personal say so
no calls at all with or without my say so my voice can be imitated too major
yes sir i just thought of something sir how do i know i am talking to you now
who do you think you are talking to
to you sir but how do i know
are you trying to be insubordinate
no sir
i hope not now as soon as you do what i told you have plan r radioed to the wing
plan r
are you hard of hearing major
no sir plan r to be radioed to the wing
are you questioning my orders major
no sir i am just bringing the facts to your attention sir
you are a good officer major and you are perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention
sort of like a new hobby huh general
i see you are playing your radio major is not that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base
oh it is not my radio sir i picked it up in the communications center
i did not mean for anyone to play anyone else s radio either major
yes sir general can i ask a question
certainly major mandrake you are a good officer and you can ask me a question any time you want to
well general ripper sir i was thinking we are on a condition red are not we
that is correct major
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress does not it
that is a good question major maybe if you think hard you can think of the answer yourself
well i was thinking maybe an enemy attack is not in progress
but then sir why have you issued the order wing attack plan r
suppose that were the case
but why that would be an awful thing to do sir
i know that sir
i suppose they are sir
you are damned right they are
how much soda sir
that about right
what shall we drink to sir
general ripper can i ask another question
ask away major
well general i was wondering why are you doing this i mean why do you want to start the war
i have given it alot of thought major do not think i have not
no sir i mean i did not think you had not given it a lot of thought
do you remember what clemenceau once said about war
i do not think so sir
he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals
well i think i remember reading the report on that was not it something like a hundred and sixty million
that is close enough major
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people sir
i suppose we might catch them off their guard
our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy would not they
i guess so
but if you just let things alone we would not lose anyone
major mandrake i guess you do not follow that is going on too closely do you
where sir
well i know they have been going on for years and they have not gotten any place
not yet major not yet
and i guess they will not until they agree to let us inspect inside their country
you are very naive major do not they say they want disarmament
yes sir but so do we
i still ask why do they want disarmament
gee sir that last remark does not exactly make all the sense in the world
major you are talking like one of them
well i am not sir honestly sir
do not be offended major our president holds the same views
but general we are on our toes we have not agreed to anything for years inffact a a lot of people say we never will
but if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want we would agree would not we
if they gave us what we think we need yes i guess we would
and you would like to see that
general that is good enough for the president and all the experts he is got working on the thing is good enough for me
do you think we would cheat
no sir i am sure we would not
major those are my boys out there dying
to peace on earth major
it was a honest mistake sir
i presume the planes are armed
i am afraid so mister presient being part of the air borne alert each plane is carrying a full load about fifty megatons apiece
well what about the positive control the safety catch do not the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order
that is right sir but the planes were at their positive control points ready to turn around when general ripper issued the final go code
and i suppose there s some reason why you have not recalled them
yes sir the base commander general ripper selected plan r
how soon until the enemy finds out that is going on
we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty five min utes
general jack would ripper sir
i want to talk to general ripper
i do not think that is a fair analogy sir
but he will hear everything we are saying and if he just looks out of that window he will see everything we are doing
we do not operate like you kgb boys
have you received acknowledgements from every plane
they are coming in now
how long will it take to receive them all
i believe it will be just a few minutes at the most
how many planes did we lose
i am not certain mister president but i believe it was four
general schmuck are you positive of your figures
naturally i am sir
he says they have only shot down three planes
well if you choose to take his word over mine
look he is there and you are here
mister president there were thirty four aircraft involved thirty acknowledged the recall that makes four shot down
how do you know they were shot down buck
well sir it looks like one aircraft the leper colony failed to receive the recall
that is the target
you have lied to me twice i am sorry but it will be strictly routine these men are experts
yeah to see if we are on our toes
give me a first rough course as soon as you can lieutenant ballmuff
i have got the heading major one three eight
roger maintain
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes
thanks binky can you see bromdingna island yet
all right we are still flying i am taking her down to the deck
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level
you know what that will do to our fuel consumption
what else could it be
he is right we would not have started it
they must have clobbered some of our cities already
he is right they must have clobbered some of our cities already
maximum ecm
i am sorry major kong i guess i was way out of line
a through h is correct
missiles sixty miles off heading in fast steady track they look like beam riders
just the missiles
they must have been fired from bromdingna probably one of their new vampire 202 s they have got a range well over a hundred miles
between mach 3 and 4
call them every five miles
twenty twelve o clock
should not be bad might even help but my guess is we are going to have to paddle our way back
yeah i got it in the thigh
why cannot he help me now he is sitting two feet away from me
come on quentin is not that pretty selfish putting yourself ahead of the mission
look i am shot it hurts
lieutenant quiffer we are all sorry you were hit and we will help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away
fighters closing fast range fifty miles
they must have made a visual contact
must be mach two five stuff altitude fifteen thousand
they cannot touch us at this height
if they come down low enough to make a firing pass they will never be able to pull up in time
i think they mean business
sorry king my leg s stiff as a board
sure i will take her up to eight hundred
could you take her up right now king other wise we will get kind of close to the fireball
wing attack plan r that is exactly what it says
check your code again no one at base would pull a stunt like that terry
no this looks like the real thing
lieutenant toejam are you ready for bim and bam
primary arming switch
i thought i should check out the damage first my gear is busted up pretty bad
so am i
listen i think i am hit bad
where would they get you
what does it look like
some kind of signaling
yep it is the crm 114 code all right
gee we hate to leave you like this major kong but there is not anything we can really accomplish by sticking around
listen king old buddy on behalf
i have got one
shoot lothar
our targets are a missile complex and an airfield not cities right
that is what i said
well if there s a war they must have hit us first
are you saying our order do not make sense
check target approach
bomb doors circuit is green bomb release circuit is green bomb fusing circuit is green
check all bomb circuits green okay lothar
when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary major
primary circuit is live
release first safety
second safety
fusing for ten thousand air burst
master safety
primary bomb is live
all right lothat that does it master safety on now until bomb run
let s have a rundown on the damage lothar
yes major
lothar get up here fast and bring your first aid kit i am hit kinda bad i think
cannot ace help you
he is dead
what happened
i bit his jugular vein now will you shut up and get up here
where would they get you
how do you know he is dead
he is dead all right
i do not know what we got left besides bim and bam
no look it is ope recall mistake
recall what mistake
you sure have to hand it to those guys
what do you mean
i mean pulling a stunt like that
what do you mean
well we sure as hell are not going home just because the enemy tells us to
wait a minute major ope that is the recall code where would they get that
you tell me
they must have gotten it from the base no one else would know it
why should they call us back
lieutenant zogg what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission
but the crm 114 has been smashed for almost an hour
then that settles it does not it
like hell it does
the crm 114 is smashed right
right so how could we get any messages
that is the point
i do not get you king
i said that is the point
look king maybe you have lost too much blood or something
lieutentant zogg how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back
take it easy major kong
there are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose
but the code is made up by general ripper and he is the only one left at the base who would know the code
nobody s loyalty is beyond question besides how do we know one of his staff did not see it
come on king that does not make sense
we crossed the coast over an hour ago okay
you are giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball
first lesson in war college never under estimate your enemy
sorry king
who s that
it is me lothar are you okay
i am okay that is up
well i hate to say this but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck
are you sure
well i cannot get out and look king but i do not get a green light
maybe the warning system s out
but i get a red light
have you tried the emergency system
lothar can you arm the bombs for impact
but i told you i do not think we can get the bomb bay doors open
there s no other way lothar can you are arm the bombs for impact
let me check
i think it is okay king they should go off on impact
would it matter if they hit at a flat angle i mean do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger
we are on course major just fixed our position on that river back there
i thought i would go along for the ride
now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for lothar
king would you mind if i keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in
i would be mighty proud if you did lothar
thanks king i have always wanted to take one of these big babies in
listen lothar you know that crack i made about your butt
forget it
i just wanted you to know i did not mean anything by it
at the bottom of mines
in a matter of weeks sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided

counselor you are insulting me
you new
yes viktor davidov miss
doctor jones christmas jones no jokes i’ve heard them all
what happened to len tashka
shame you had to spot i wasn’t the real thing
when this is over we should bury the hatchet celebrate a champagne dinner
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens
the plutonium is missing they’ve taken the core
then it’s no longer a bomb
what the hell were you doing you nearly killed us
i did kill us she thinks we’re dead and she thinks she got away with it
what the hell are you talking about
it’s part of some plan she dresses it up like a terrorist attack the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium
who’s she
elektra king
elektra king are you insane this is her pipeline
makes her look even more innocent
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium
what is it
the king pipeline
is there another way
he’s sealed himself in
do you know what you’re doing
what kind of bikes did you ride
count to twenty when you get to twenty open the hatch it can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink
but what if
we’ve got to get out
i love christmas in turkey
dislocated collar bone if any more tendons snap it won’t just be two weeks out of action
it’s just a scratch
then maybe i’d be open to that
construction’s not exactly my line
elektra running king industries i’ve known that girl all her life i’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into
i’ve scheduled a medical for you
it’s barely a scratch the dome broke my fall
who told you to look at elektra’s files
i took the initiative
you haven’t been given an assignment in this case
i was the one who brought that money in
i’m well aware of your stake in this 007 if you have a point get to it
‘that which does not kill me makes me stronger ’
the report king bought it’s a manual renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead
the inside man
not the usual swiss procedure mr bond but you understand a man in my position
i did not get the report from an mi 6 agent
who did you get it from
i am just a middle man i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss
your last chance take the money
your last chance give me the name
the name
revenge isn’t so hard to fathom what’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it
you will never touch her you will never get near her
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva
consider me ungrateful
it’s i who should thank you for taking that money back to mi 6 so distressing for m an explosion inside her lair
she’ll get over it
in case you’ve forgotten i’m dead already
today of all days the sun decides to shine
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs
a word i’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover
he was my father
i’m sorry
i haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day until now
is that why you want to finish the pipeline
who is he
my bodyguard he follows me everywhere he’s decisive vigilant and he makes an excellent omelette
how long has he been with you
does this look familiar to you
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone especially king’s daughter
i have to check the upper lines gabor will drive you back
always wanted to see the upper lines
oh my god we’re buried alive
i can’t stay here
no it will cave in
i can’t stay
the way i acted in the snow you must think i’m a coward
what is it
i have to go
then take me with you
no you’ll be safe here
i don’t want to be safe
vodka martini
if this little show is for my benefit i’ll take you home right now
surely you believe in living dangerously
what’s wrong with you are you crazy
a little does it matter after all what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive isn’t that right elektra isn’t that your motto
what are you talking about
are you saying renard is the man who’s trying to kill me
you can drop the act it’s over
i don’t know what you’re talking about
i’m coming with you
i could have given you the world
where’s m
all this because you fell for renard
you turned renard
so you killed your father
was this all about the oil
know what happens when a man is strangled
one last screw
valentin zukovsky
bondjamesbond what brings you here
mafia warlords diplomats and spies consortiums from every country in the world a nice little rat’s nest
see you’re upsetting my customers what do you want
how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with state of the art russian army weapons
if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division
where did you get this
that too everyone does what they can to survive
how high up does this arms dealing go
bond if someone wants you dead it is renard our government has nothing to gain by killing you
what are doing bond trying to impress this innocent thing
she’s no innocent this is my nuclear consultant
really bond couldn’t you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears
what’s your business with elektra king
that is 5 000 dollars of beluga ruined
now where were we
a rope
alright alright sometimes i smuggle machinery for her russian stuff
and the payoff on the tables
where’s the sub going
no get me out
this is too big for even you where is it
mother of god
the maiden’s tower
how appropriate
what is this place
what class sub does your nephew run
i’ll send someone out
your father
now you know how it feels to be locked away to wonder if they’re coming for you if anyone will ever come for you
someone will come
so beautiful so smooth so warm
why are you like this because bond is dead it’s what you wanted
he was a good lover
this is the end
everything’s under control up here are you ready
we’ve been pawns in someone’s game they tricked us into bringing the money to king not just elaborate cock sure
do we have the range of renard’s plane
the parcel’s in the post
it’s heading for the oil terminal

if necessary
you should always work with a spotter
i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town

he is uptight
he takes his work seriously
he takes himself seriously
logan do you see this ring
