who is she
bianca stratford  sophomore do not even think about it
you know french

yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew
that is her  bianca's sister
i teach her french get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me
what about him
what makes you think he will do it
forget his reputation  do you think we have got a plan or not
did she actually say she would go out with you
i thought you hated those people
this is it  a golden opportunity patrick can ask katarina to the party
in that case we will need to make it a schoolwide blow out
will bogey get bent
number one  she hates smokers
it is a lung cancer issue
her favorite uncle
he is pretty
assail your ears for one night
you told me that part already
buttholus extremus  but hey you are making progress

and he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way
what have you got for me
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night
cameron i am a little busy
what  are you talking about
what would you do to her
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns   that is a direct quote
you making any headway
that is the worst
the vintage look is over kat have not you been reading your sassy
yeah and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow  tough break
hey  do you mind
leave my sister alone
two legs nice rack
yeah whatever  i want you to go out with her
sure sparky  i will get right on it
you just said
you need money to take a girl out
you got it verona  i pick up the tab you do the honors
i cannot take a girl like that out on twenty bucks
take it or leave it  this is not a negotiation
when i shell out fifty i expect results
i am on it
watching the bitch trash my car does not count as a date
a hundred bucks a date
forget it
it is about time
how would you do it
do what
i do not know dorsey the limothe flowers  another hundred for the tux 
are you lost
nope  just came by to chat
we do not chat
well actually i thought i would run an idea by you  you know just to see if you are interested
i hear you are helping verona
uh  yeah  we are old friend*
you and verona
you better not fuck this up  i am heavily invested
who's that
patrick verona   random skid
that is pat verona the one who was gone for a year i heard he was doing porn movies
i am sure he is completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
he always look so
mandella eat  starving yourself is a very slow way to die
that is this
the people at this school are so incredibly foul
william would never have gone to a state school
william did not even go to high school
that is never been proven
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but i am consuming  do you mind
does it matter
you think this will work
what would he say
you went to the party  i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity
i did not have a choice
you did not have a choice  where is kat and what have you done with her
i did bianca a favor and it backfired
you did not
can you even imagine  who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess
well i guess we are not since we do not have dates 
listen to you  you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica
okay okay we will not go  it is not like i have a dress anyway
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective  we are making a statement
william  he asked me to meet him here
i mean woman  how ya doing
sweating like a pig actually  and yourself
there's a way to get a guy's attention
pick you up friday then
the night i take you to places you have never been before  and back
like where  the 7eleven on burnside do you even know my name screwboy
you hate me do not you
i do not really think you warrant that strong an emotion
then say you will spend dollar night at the track with me
and why would i do that
come on  the ponies the flat beer you with money in your eyes me with my hand on your ass
are you following me
you are not a big talker are you
excuse me
that is what you want is not it
you know these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats but they are right up there
you know who the raincoats are
that is this
i am getting trashed man is not that what you are supposed to do at a party
i say do what you wanna do
you are not okay
i just need to lie down for awhile
uh uh you lie down and you will go to sleep
this is so patronizing
leave it to you to use big words when you are shitfaced
why  are you doing this
i told you
you do not care if i die
because then i would have to start taking out girls who like me
like you could find one
see that  who needs affection when i have got blind hatred
i thought you were above all that
and i am in control of it
no you were not
then why would you ask
i should do this
start a band
my father would not approve of that that
oh so now you think you know me
so what ' s up with your dad  he a pain in the ass
excuse me have you seen the feminine mystique  i lost my copy
what are you doing here
i heard there was a poetry reading
unwelcome  i guess someone still has her panties in a twist
do not for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
so what did i have an effect on 
he left  i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me
i guess i never told you i am afraid of heights
c'mon  it is not that bad
put your right foot there 
forget it  i am staying
the partridge family
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect  and piss you off
good call
so how would you get chapin to look the other way
a soft side who knew
yeah well do not let it get out
so that is your excuse
so if you disappoint them from the start you are covered
something like that
tell me something true
i hate peas
no  something real  something no one else knows
no one else knows
you are amazingly selfassured has anyone ever told you that
is that a request or a command
no what
no i will not go with you
why not
create a little drama  start a new rumor  what
so i have to have a motive to be with you
you tell me
you need therapy  has anyone ever told you that
answer the question patrick
how would you get a tux at the last minute
it is scurvy's  his date got convicted where would you get the dress
it is just something i had  you know
oh huh
that ' s completely adorable
wait i
you were paid to take me out  by  the one person i truly hate  i knew it was a setup
it was not like that
really  what was it like  a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
a fender strat you bought this
besides i had some extra cash some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl
is that right
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill
because i like to torture you
oh bianca  can you get me my freshman yearbook
i know
i thought we decided you were going to school here  at u of 0
my insurance does not cover pms
then tell them i had a seizure
is this about sarah lawrence you punishing me
i thought you were punishing me
why cannot we agree on this
because you are making decisions for me
as a parent that is my right
was that your sister
i do not understand the allure of dehydrated food  is this something i should be hip to
no daddy
so tell me about this dance was it fun
parts of it
which parts
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy
bianca did what
that is the matter  upset that i rubbed off on her
when i go
katarina stratford  my my  you have been terrorizing ms blaise again
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls  i was merely a spectator
am i supposed to feel better like right now  or do i have some time to think about it
cool pictures  you a fan
you think
what plan
the situation is my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford
i think i speak correctly when i say that camerongs love is pure  purer than say  joey dorsey's
that is where we can help you  with kat
you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast
are you telling me i am a   nonsmoker
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows
so you got cozy with she who stings
you were right she is still pissed
sweet love renew thy force
i missed you
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls
it was a bratwurst  i was eating lunch
i do not understand patrick  you have not done anything asinine this week are you not feeling well
touch of the flu
why do not we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid
you are completely demented
in the microwave
that is a synonym for throbbing
would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a british rear admiral

space stattion 5  lounge
hi frank coming in please
dave if you have a minute i would like your advice on something
sure what is it
well it is nothing really important but it is annoying
that is up
it is possible
well what do you think we ought to do about it
i do not think we should make any fuss about it yet i am sure they will straighten it out
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
i suppose the idea was specialized training
yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout
i do not know all i heard is that there's something about the mission we were not told
that seems very unlikely
yes i thought so
just ask hal it is conceivable they might keep something from us but they would never keep anything from hal
yes but it is to fantastic to think that they would keep something from us
i know it would be almost inconceivable
but not completely inconceivable
i suppose it is not logically impossible
i guess it is not
well that is something
yes i do not know what to make of it
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
yes but it is more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
good morning how is it going
are you reasonably awake
oh i am fine i am wide awake that is up
well hal's reported the aounit about to fail again
i do not know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
two units in four days how many spares do we have
two more
i did not do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them
i guess you do not know your own strength old boy
i guess not
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think we have got a problem
what is it hal
the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours
not now hal i would like to talk to you about something
sure dave that is up
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition
yes i know
you probably also know that we found them okay
i am not questioning your word dave but it is just not possible i am not capable of being wrong
i am sorry about the misunderstanding hal
well do not worry about it
and do not you worry about it
is your confidence in me fully restored
yes it is hal
too bad about frank is not it
yes it is
the antenna has to be replaced
i am goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please
look dave your have probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
i am at space station five darling how are you
i am having a party tomorrow
yes i know that sweetheart
are you coming to my party
no i am sorry darling i told you i will not be home for a few days
when are you coming home
one two three can i speak to mommy
mommy's out to the hair dresser
where is mrs brown
she is in the bathroom
okay sweetheart well i have to go now tell mommy that i called
how many days until you come home
okay sweetheart have a lovely birthday party tomorrow
thank you daddy
i will wish you a happy birthday now and i will see you soon all right darling
yes daddy
'bye 'bye now sweetheart
oh thank you very much
thank you
well i have heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
and your charming little daughter
oh she is growing up very fast as a matter of fact she is six tomorrow
oh that is such a delightful age
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
are you sure you will not change your mind about a drink
no thank you and i am afraid now i really must be going
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you
well thank you very much for being so understanding
please it really does not matter
well did you have a pleaant flight
yes very pleasant
yes i think so just about then
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
are you quite sure
well as it happens i am on my way up to the moon
are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
i am sorry but i am not sure i know what you mean
you mean you have not been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
that is right
yes well i hope the crew got back safely
fortunately they did
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts
yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
how can you tell it was deliberately buried
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
but you do not have any idea as to what it is
has it been exposed to any sun before now
oh marvellous it is the first real sleep i have had for the past two days
there's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
when do we arrive at clavius
we are scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you
thank you
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
i see
well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you do not mind me asking

i remember you nowthe so called art dealer
i am glad you got your memory back father because you are going to need it where are the stones
why on earth do the stones interest you
personally they are of no interest to me i would rather sell weaponsbut i have a customer so tell me
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you
why  that is wrong with me
i am a priest i am here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it
would you like a drink

you are a monster zorg
excuse me i am looking for a priest

there's no light you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light

your theory is interesting father but i do not think we have time to go into it right now
we have fortyeight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
is there anything that can stop it
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here
what are we going to do
it is a miracle
what is

now they feel itdown below
it does not seem possible but  could it be an electrical storm center

jack's sort of sensitive i guess more than most but he will be okay in a few weeks
jack does not need money
everybody needs money except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch soninlaw of his people like that
i can see what you looked like as a kid
what way
after making love i like it it is nice to see that in a grownup person
oh wade
i have been thinking about it that is all
did you tell them  that we were coming
do not you think it is proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents
i know your parents
are you sure they are home did you call
think they are alright
what happened
what on earth is happening to you why are you acting this way
it is my tooth my fucking tooth i cannot even think anymore because of it
do not lie to me you are leaving me i can see that
have you been heating the house not just with the stove
there's a furnace
you are not using it today
it is broke i guess there's an electric in the bedroom
coffee's perked
when did she die
whitehouse next time phone ahead
what the hell are you talking about
yesterday morning you passed a stopped school bus which was flashing its lights then you
hold on
do not give me a hard time mr gordon i am just 
doing your fucking job i know i watch television too
who are you
i was i am wade whitehouse i was wondering is your husband here
he is asleep we were up very late
well yes i am i want to say that i am real sorry about your father mrs twombley
something about my father
oh no no it is a it is a traffic thing no big deal
take care wade
i am not finding fault it is a good idea good for you good for the town real modern too
you talked to jack
not since last night he took a guy hunting
the other guy
jillie you want a cheese grilled sandwich
his office you mean my old office
well i guess  that is what he said
you remember margie fogg
from wickham's been a while like some coffee
how you and ma doing have not seen you in town for a while
where is ma
is there something wrong with the phone
in the living room
why did not you call and have the furnace fixed
pop for christ's sake
love what the fuck do you know about love
love i am made of love
call it what you want
nothing in the fucking house to drink not a fucking thing my house my money my truck  stolen
it will come out jack lied and the kid will get hung for it
no shit
you think jack shot him
well it was an accident
the night before the shooting
how was she
jill i was thinking of getting a lawyer maybe you can help me
what happened
do not think about it you are exhausted
yeah i guess
have not you already done a bit of that
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do i guess
anyone else want one rolfe
no thanks i do not drink
what about margie
what about her
anything new about the shooting twombley
i guess it was an accident like everybody thinks
find them everywhere 
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one
which is
that it was not an accident
then who shot him
well your friend i think jack hewitt
who would pay him that kind of money not the mob they got their own guys specialists
they would not deal with a guy like jack who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead
so mel gordon would not want a professional hit that would make the feds dig deeper he wants an accident
not particularly
right's right goddamnit do not you care that is right
i hate to disappoint you but i do not think it happened
of course it happened why would i lie about it
it may have happened but not the way you said
we would have to go digging in vietnam to ask him
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
i know what it means i am just running out of ways to use it
it is not like he has not made us wait a few times
well you are not the president dear
you do not want to say hi to your father
i am sure he is busy
mom just this once give it a rest

he is not here  why ask me
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is

i am sergeant sykes and this is detective jetson los angeles police department
yes i heard about poor warren tragic
move a finger harcourt and you are history
that cop the human he was the one who killed anderson and the driver
this is becoming a serious breach of security
he did not recognize me
my true name is ss'tangya t'ssorentsa'
let's talk hubley
his body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of central avenue near downtown
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest
through the chest  rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
terrific  a real pillar of the community  was hubley missing anything when they found him  was he ripped off
yes no it is not unreasonable although i
get the picture
and that fits
well yeah it is rubber  it stretches
newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks
i believe i should interview the widow alone
mrs porter is not taking her husband's death well
awright  what about the other guy
she did not know him  but she said her son might
did you talk to him
rudyard kipling  no shit  listen we just need a minute of your time
why did you do it
who said that
your name would not happen to be porter would it
uh matthew
back off george
but i 
screw you
tell me
matthew you do not have to 
you know that guy
from quarantine when my people first arrived here  he and i were housed together
which one is that  raw what
so what was that other word for human slow ka
ss'loka'  it means literally small but intelligent creature  it loses much in the translation
and what was that one about my mother  that was a good one
ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'
who is he
we were chasing you because you ran you dumb sonofabitch
so she keeps you on a pretty short leash does she
yeah i know the routine
you are married

your home is quite disordered  i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in
your health
there is so much our two peoples do not understand about each other

george she is not gonna divorce you you mate for life remember
well let's roll george

warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub
no secrets goddammit  you do not hold back from me  whatever is going on you are gonna tell me now
 it is called ss'jabroka'  to us it is a potent narcotic
we  you have taken it

george look me in the eye george you do not ever lie to me again
okay george  we gotta play this real smart
if the drug is here we must destroy it
uh george
the fifty kilos matthew  i have to find it  i cannot let it get out on the street
that is this about george  i know that look
no  we must do this alone
what is this
 it is harcourt

but there's no more drug

what is it
casull 454 magnum  you are talking twice the impact energy of 44 magnum hot loads

some everyone does
hello david i am dr hirsch and this is a countryman of yours mr collins
where am i
you are in a hospital in london
london where is jack i had a strange dream
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences
the guy i was with is he all right how did i get to london
miss price miss price please
how long have i been here
you have been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
there were witnesses
in time i am sure it will all come back to you
you have never had bad dreams before
you would be surprised what horrors a man is capable of
did you see jack
no in fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here
did you talk to the police in east proctor did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb
dr hirsch  i would rather not be by myself
you are not having a good time are you
well i like it here
do you think she will meet me in rome
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
she is a jerk
you are talking about the woman i love
i am talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
well anyway do you think she will be there
if you do not stop i am going to kill you
i have to make love to her it is very simple she has no choice really
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull
we have known debbie what since the eighth grade how many years of foreplay is that
the slaughtered lamb
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
that is a wolf's head
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol
that is not a spear it is a pike
nice looking group
listen at least it is warm in here
what about it
it is a fivepointed star
ask them what the candles are for
go on ask them
jack we would better go
come on jack shall we go
what the hell was that all about
i do not know let's see if there's an inn or something up the road
beware the moon
what do you think was wrong
i have no idea
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural
say david
did you hear that
i heard that
a coyote
there are not any coyotes in england
the hound of the baskervilles
heathcliffe did not howl
no but he was on the moors
shit david what is that

thanks a lot
this is too much i cannot handle this
i am sorry to be upsetting you david but i had to come
are not you supposed to be buried in new york someplace
yeah your parents came to my funeral i was surprised at how many people came
why should you be surprised you were a very wellliked person
debbie klein cried a lot
i cannot stand it
so you know what she does she is so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine's bed
rudy levine the shmuck
david now i know this may be hard for you but i have to warn you
we were attacked by a werewolf
i am not listening
on the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf
shut up you zombie
i was murdered an unnatural death and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted
that is wrong with you shut up
the wolf's bloodline must be severed the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed
you survived and now you shall continue the curse
what are you talking about i will not accept this get out god damit
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said 'beware the moong
stop it jack
beware the moon the full moon david you have got two days

a monster i know i know
you must take your own life now david before it is too late
jack are you really dead
you must believe me
hi jack
what can i say jack
you do not have to say anything

if i was still alive i probably would
you look awful
because this must be stopped
i could hang myself
dr hirsch
no thank you doctor
you were saying
has david kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved that is true but i hardly think
what can we do to assist you
lt villiers and sgt mcmanus are here to see you doctor
excuse me  yes
roger mathison doctor
what here
hello there what can i get you
campari and soda would do nicely

gatling they have got a gatling

never thought that pissant town would look so pretty
your ma would not let us leave until we ate something
here's liberty's favorite son  i will never forget what you did cousin
our place clell miller's sammy johnston the creeders will hite
the sheriff says it was a gang of drunk kansas boys
these are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad
uhh yeah it does
we got a problem here brother
this is the best score yet
it is still taking too long the people used to snap to
that was because of the reputation the gang had
as long as people think jesse's still riding we will never get the respect we deserve
cole we are outlaws not exactly the most respectable job if you know what i mean
how would they 
what have you done
i ai not done 
i swear 
i am sorry cole
things changed when you quit the gang for example i am now the one who says let's ride
he is not bad at it
my plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine thank you
jesus mercy that is charlie higgins dave laller 
cole i want to get to the farm make sure little jim and the girls are okay
oh no
they said because the detectives were working for the department of the interior 
you have no shame
okay folks i think we know how this is going to go
beg pardon
this is about the wanted posters is not it
the things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here
you are a fine figure of a man
listen jesse we have got a problem  it is cole
he is been full of vinegar lately

what you saying boy
about time you got here buddy

home boys back to our farms
hands off your hip cole

you ever notice zerelda's eyes
she had a moustache
she was european
thanks for the help
after all you did on our farm  you miss it do not you jesse
the war what are you crazy  there are things i miss about it
it was exciting
so what do we do general lee
perfect cole
i got seven thousand
see frank's being smart about this
jesse we got to have a word
sure cousin
this is your fault for hogging all the publicity
it will be the biggest score yet
smells funny it being mentioned in the paper
if you would read about it first you would have no problems
now the one time one of us comes up with an idea 
a bad idea
i got us through the war all right
and almost got hanged in peacetime
i am the better soldier jesse
still smells fishy
okay you are gonna rest here
bob rip up some bandages
we will make them pay for this
i am out
what we follow you for a year and now that our blood's been spilled you are gonna quit
missed you cousin
you know you getting caught right after leaving us some people thought 
where would you get all these riders
some indian tracker you turned out to be tom
cannon or gatling
both would be nice
what the 
i think one of 'em's glass
which one right or left
oh lord the dance hall girl at bunty's
i have no idea what you just said but it sounded real nice
bastards come back here and face me
another dozen out back
they gonna rush us
the safe now
where is jesse james
open the damn safe
you 'um big lawman
yeah injun what do you want
great chief of st louis send me
go ahead to the saloon but do not get too drunk
i know it ai not no durned bank holiday
you are right sir
then why cannot i go in there
on account of we are robbing it
oh why did not you just say so
it is a secret
fine i will just wait here
what the 
what is it
where the hell were you
 rode right into them screaming like a banshee
my little web did that
web died fighting
what do you say sir
he is going to be fine right daddy
they are gone what are you 
i fooled them into thinking i was alone
well i hope the boy pulls through we should know in the morning
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling they try to shoot it off
distracting enough for you
pff they hardly even noticed you
such as
you could have worn one of those big floppy womangs easter sunday hats
that would have made an impression
i figure
see that is your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff i am already finished doing it
web's dead
i reckoned
hell of a war
looks like web mimms was not the only casualty this towngs got
frank do not you have something to say
you are doing just fine
think about this if we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right
that just might work
big and older
you can shut up now
you are a charmer
i swear i will shoot you in your sleep
she is still talking to jesus
you know him
you ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming
you are looking a bit more spry now that somebody 
 we could move on rebuild make a decent life someplace else
do not care
did not think you would  i am going to go make the coffin
how would it go in there
fine how would it go out here
and i planned getting you off the hangmangs deck 
and it is guarded by pinkerton detectives
gents we are in the middle of something here
bob's upset
pardon the delay folks but we had to get mad bob younger under control
this has been a good year
jesse we are outlaws
and we are good at it
it got to you did not it all the killing in the war you need it now
you have killed your fair share of men
if i could go back to farming 
that is a lie you could have bought a dozen farms with the money we have stolen
i cannot quit and leave you alone i cannot quit until you quit ma would have wanted it that way
we are doing this for ma
we are drunk
oh yeah
you taking sides against me now frank
they are all pinned down cannot even get to the door
shoulda learned with web made it look fun made it look like an adventure got web killed now jim
railroad burned him out too you could not have stopped him
a war against the railroad what the hell were we thinking
i will meet you down there in a few weeks
see you soon oh and i appreciate the distraction back there
y'know uncle frank
sounds like he was a hell of a man
that he was
they are making him a hero now
saved a lot of folk from the railroad
but he killed a lot of men too
cannot argue that
so what was he
uncle frank
yeah jimmy
how much of that story is true
did you kill yankees
a fair number ma
ma i am glad to see you being nice to our injun friend
the lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard nobody will ever find them
we know ma now we got to get you to doc mimms
zerelda little zee mimms
you were little jesse james when you left
but still died
you should not be up
i have been on my back two weeks i am sick of it
you are sick of my company
no i mean of course not no
teasing you is completely unfair
what you do to me is unfair the teasing i mean
i was not the only one risking my neck that day
so you are saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger
you did not want to farm
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate
a river pirate
arr hand over your jewels missy
thank god you grew out of that  you did grow out of that did not you
mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james
not if i find the right girl
and that is this right girl like
smart funny bossy always makes me think she is two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth
where will you find such a girl
ahem from this doctrine no ah from womengs eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still like  shiny sparkling rocks
sparkling rocks
little ones
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting
i am so sorry jesse
you and i we have started something you know  i do not know what will happen if you do this
me neither
let the law 
laws do not touch men like thaddeus rains only justice does
whose justice yours or god's  when will you stop
jesse what are you thinking there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county
i do not understand
she is the most wonderful woman in the world cannot get her out of my mind
that is wonderful it is just i thought
i would never have imagined us in a place like this
that is why i picked it we can start a whole new life down here
i beg your pardon
blazing guns of the west true stories of jesse james only a dime in the hotel lobby
aw shucks ma'am
stop it this is just sad
you get arrested again i will kill you
yes ma'am
i cannot believe i had to blow up a train for you
you are a hell of a woman
do not swear
we are moving you tomorrow
so i will get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains
did you order our houses burned down
how did you spot the ambush in torrell
almost got me in billings i saw you there shooting at me
i went myself to oversee the operation did not help much
oh that is nice to know  we are going to hang you you know
i figured
was it worth it
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it
that is what i would have done
i am not hanged yet
you cocky little bastard
ahh you will miss me
that was for my ma now this is for everybody else
i would just as soon kill you jesse james but chasing you takes up too much of my time
this is unusual most of our marriages are members of the congregation
discretion sir i am a man of the cloth
thank you
now let's have a drink
and you are too young
i am the same age you were when you went off to war
you okay jesse
yeah hey are you drinking whisky you are too young to be drinking whisky
not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink
jim you been with a girl yet
well not exactly
i swear
tell you something else  i cannot drink that good neither i am going to go outside and throw up
 too young for whisky
this time we will make an exception
jesse you explain to lyla my girl you know from that time
why yeah
i hope you do not mind jesse james told me your name
oh you were talking to jesse
i hope i am not being too forward
not at all
i just though you were awful cute
thank you miss  
lyla devereux
gosh that is a pretty name buy you a drink
could we go upstairs and talk it is so loud down here
why do not we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk
well this land is about to be condemned
my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time
they had to be dealt with
there's only four of them
mr thaddeus rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers
yes sir
i see i will get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight
how much did they get from the safe
thirtyfive thousand sir coins and currency and the delay from the miles of destroyed track 
i will kill them for blowing up my railway
to be precise they did not blow up the tracks
then who did
your men knew the risks
with my money
the final route for the railroad is complete
what is that
this is him
how did you know
look at this pinkerton they got the payroll and this damage will set construction back two months at least
you would not have done that
oh no i would have done that but i would have made sure i killed them too
i want them arrested and hanged
would a jury around here convict their own i think not we are beginning an interesting game here mr rains
this is no game
so you cannot tell me anything
i cannot believe this
yes that is the way to win the locals back to our side
cannot you tell me anything
in english pinkerton
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
can you put men at all four
no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank

alice you gotta make him do the startup with teddy and me

i am just screwed

i forgot that is why you have to help me decide
no way you have this  destiny
c'mon i would not have a destiny without you my destiny would be dying at 20 from eating 
do not bring that up like a different girlfriend would would have let you die
whengs brian coming for the tv
that took some fun out of 
you know he is never been anybody's counselor before
to our new life  that is wrong
he is your boss he is not your 
i know i know
if you cannot deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
i mean if one little comment from gary is gonna upset you this much 
teddy was killed last night
what are you  what
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death nelson said it was an airtight case
i do not know what i am saying maybe  maybe they hired those guys
you are scaring me i think we should just go
go where you cannot get away from people like this
like this it is gary you are talking about
you think i do not know that
i cannot just walk away
i know how to get in there but you have gotta help me
whaddo i do
the justice department guy who came to the apartment when 
if i would stayed down there maybe this would not have happened
why does not he ask us to his party he is never even met you
he has thousands of employees milo 
are you gonna tell me where you went
you look beautiful
do not we have any chopsticks
wanna savor this
it is gonna get cold
right wait a toast
he will tell me when he gets home
that will be a test will not it
he was not acting
do not worry milo i am here as a friend or maybe a supplicant
it is just  i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability create something
mr barton do you remember me
it is  milo is not it
yes sir i need to talk to you
yeah hi thank you for seeing me
what seems to be the problem you look a little upset
my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley
if there's a civil rights violation but generally we let the local police and da do their work first
i  just wanna help bring these guys to justice they are neonazis
let me look into it see that is being done frankly it is not my area
'just did not know who else to talk to
and outpost you are happy there
well i parked illegally see y'later
this is the biggest beta demo in like the history of software you would be my partner
you cannot preempt yoga that is our biggest show
will i get to work for outpost
you are interfaced with our dish
is it your software
when did you know
that is gotta kill him right
outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
that would change with a criminal indictment
there's no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems to have vanished
is not there a stigma bankrolling this guy
stigma larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
and the kid who wrote skywire  then gave it away they are calling him the digital robin hood
milo surprised he is not your guest
we tried
milo i am danny
'could not convince teddy to come
he is pretty tight with his family
we could move 'em up here
who's that
would you like a coke or something
you know a lot about art i guess
when you get to a certain age you start wondering about your legacy i doubt you even remember outpost 10 
no just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
'think i should buy some originals
do i
somebody said i am just another philistine with reproductions
that is insane you are ahead of your time
how is it going
maybe i am going too fast
it is okay really
you did this  overnight
milo that is up
well  you sent for me
you really wrote this just today
i heard what happened
had you talked to him much lately
just once 'guess i was worried we did not have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
did you
talk about work never
i meant did you find other stuff to 
oh yeah
you have been coming in early
wow you must have 20000 lines of code there
been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler and it came over me it is in the wrong place
the wrong place
gary hi
you look a little tired
i am okay it is going well
that is great thanks
you could have handwritten it
i am not much good at handwriting or parties
gary i 
this is good who did it
'startup not 50 miles from here kid's on prozac
what would the girl say
has not affected his work though
help me change the skywire settings add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
gary do not worry we 
okay 2
ready for number three
let's go
longitude 109 
all the companies know the faculties tell 'em at the target schools
i think you should go
you do
it is only meaningful when you have got 40000 lines of code to back it up
man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
your app kind of blew mine out of the water
we will come up with the next big thing
you wanna work  here
could it be a glitch something the construction workers caused
every entry was authorized
keep looking
what are we looking for
delbert seems to enter 21 twice without leaving the first time
get the backslash the colon keys kids do not use but geeks do  what would milo want in here anyway
you calling phil and randy
come with me
now what are we doing i do not get any of this shit
you know my name
you know mine
you are famous around here
i am getting a teacher's pet rep
i would not worry about it you have gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets
were you
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
me too were you an army brat or something
what have you got there
graphical interfaces for skywire i am s'posed to coordinate with you
did you wanna be alone
mine's not the ceo he barely remembers to take a shower
right right but does he ever just like hand you code
maybe once i rewrote it anyway
you are compulsive
mmmmore like  i have a little trouble trusting people
why's that
so when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers was that then or now
that is great i  did not know
i snuck into 21
is that my  scenario  tell me
they would frame him
i always felt if a  boy i liked ever found out  he would run he would think i was unclean
what about the fbi
they have got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person it is over
who can we trust
the mainstream media tv or a newsmagazine
right but gary's tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home
it is a standard gui once i have got a concept it is maybe three day's work
gary knows i am close on skywire we have to do this fast
before they kill somebody else too
oh man i would have to get into gary's house to get the satellite positions
you mean  break in
why were you so careless
why were you snooping in my office
'think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are
i told teddy about you
what would he say
great i knocked off the aglet as soon as i get a passable version of skywire we are there
the dishes are juiced up too
thank god
same with the excerpts i am choosing they will play against any of the images you described
perfect  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to 
you could always say you have to go the bathroom
that is lame is not it
please do not go
meet me at the other location
they know i had no choice get out of the house now do you have a laptop
it is three years old it 
bring it to the other location
maybe it is the satellite
latitude 47 degrees
you got my email
and your phone messages you wanna do what you do it is not a crime
is that how larry feels
wanted to say goodbye to him
they are in the neighborhood they usually hassle vietnamese grocers
i met this girl
what come on is it serious
i do not know
a beautiful geek i do not wanna sound paranoid or like a pig but what are the chances
what d'you mean
i dunno i guess larry's got me totally suspicious of that place
what does that mean
milo geeks do not have two girlfriends most do not have one
so  how far are we from the campus
so how would you like the house
his snapples were in alphabetical order
every geek here's got a thing for lisa but that is about the biggest reaction she is had to anybody
she is a programmer
heavy graphical background doing designinterface for skywire apps  you will be working with her
i have got a girlfriend remember
we tried the big vaporware number gary it is nosale
maybe he will get back to work
speaking of which
did you download corey in san jose
damn 'have to go back over there  be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
there's nothing in this hall someone's pulling your chain as usual
that kid's the great white hope
i could get it out of him
who are these guys
where is he
fellas i am gonna have to ask you to leave here now
wait a second i am the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
we are not yet open for business i am afraid
sir august merryweather i was looking for something relaxing say a tuscan hillside in june
of course natural weather delivered to your door on demand down your phoneline for limited periods
you do not say how real does it feel
as real as you wish hot or cold humid or dry anything you like within reason
how long have i been here
would that i could say the same
have we met
ah beautiful just as he promised
promised who promised
may i help you madam 
mr john steed please
you are female
as you see
then you cannot come in
i have an appointment
no women not in boodles not since 1922
sir august   sir august  
your voice  it is so familiar 
this is not a game
quite right but we still make the rules
rules are made to be broken
people too
my number two special assignments she is 
how curious 
would it be possible to use it for military purposes
i resign
you need treatment mrs peel  you cannot resign
what are you trying to do to me
the death of peter peel was a great loss to us all 
the institute  the funding 
this is an official matter mrs peel no need to take it personally where are you going
to find out who killed my husband
the doors and walls are monitored mrs peel this is a very secure establishment
about your next assignment mrs peel 
ahem as i was saying perhaps another macaroon 
good luck  peter  emma
a slight miscalculation  my face was burned beyond recognition fortunately my research into plastics came in handy 
dr darling peter  all you 
an unholy trinity 
you killed my husband
for starters of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well 
too many cooks 
spoil the majority shareholders in wonderland weather i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you 
but i found you all the clues led me here 
of course i planned that too
but  why
you disappoint me emma  cannot you guess  for you it was all for you 
'our revels now are ended'
think of this as your second wedding feast 
you know i believe she is actually jealous
valentine listen to me 
that is better i say is not this where you came in it is impenetrable by the way 
you are mad
such as
destruction of their local weather systems i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
the result would be 
chaos transport paralysis crop failure  economic disaster frostbite or sunburn  on a massive scale you have seen a few samples
doctor peel i presume
i was about to throw in the towel
i had a spot of bother at the door
i should not wonder not a woman inside boodles since 
1922 why the kippers
red herring would have been too obvious do not you think
so what was all this  some sort of test
congratulations you have penetrated a bastion of male privilege i guessed you were not a stickler for tradition doctor
whereas you are
dyed in the wool but i can admire someone who does not play by the rules
rules are made to be broken
not by me play by the rules doctor or the game is nothing
and just what is the game
i say this is all terribly formal must i go an calling you dr peel
under the circumstances you may call me mrs peel
 showers followed by sunny periods
ah  from trubshaw's  my shoemaker
my father always wanted a boy
really  i fail to see the connection
do you
i thought we were on our way
oh absolutely but trubshaw's a man worth meeting no point setting out half shod
you can but i wish you would not 
that place is so absurd so out of date 
you know what i mean this car  and you nobody walks around like that milk
and i suppose you are the knight
the most unpredictable piece on the board and always ready to protect his queen
sir august merryweather  why are we seeing him first
as per mother's instructions
do we always follow mother's instructions
they call me in when they have reached a dead end freelance like yourself
i have no choice why should you risk your life
after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking more tea
no thanks
not so much eccentric more barking mad he has a wife called june and a daughter somewhere  julie
june july  august
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
so  i distract him while you snoop around how
ah brenda   mrs peel
i was not about to
i mean your man trubshaw  your bulletproof waistcoat  i thought you were just overdressed
mother and dr darling have me under observation they think i tried to kill you
why should they think that
you told them you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times left you for dead
frankly that is how i remember it
but that is absurd i may not be overfond of you steed but it is not my style
did he say who
an invitation to a 'formal picnic'
i must say you look more your old self 
you mean my other self 
either way  may i ask why you dress in that fashion
colonel crabtree international satellite systems formerly of the ministry
elementary mrs peel trubshaw is not the only shoemaker still practicing his trade 
what on earth
any ideas
well he was a fellow of the royal zoological society 
is that written in his shoe
common knowledge mrs peel 
for you mrs peel
not quite this is my field
but if someone miniaturized the process
that is what we were working on
three agents killed by bad weather
 and by you mrs peel 
then a mad millionaire head of a secret defense establishment a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather 
 and by you mrs peel everything points to you  no sisters  no undiscovered twin
is that what you think
do you always drive this fast
this must be the last straw
here's the one that broke the camel's back
someone did not want us to get to the party
was i
i expect that is for you to know and me to find out 
to kill me
i could save you the trouble
no trouble
because you always obey orders 
and do you trust me
i could be convinced if  i knew who poisoned me in the maze that kiss 
mmm  what are you doing
keeping a stiff upper lip
but you did suspect me
not for a moment
you are playing games
are not we all mrs peel
i thought you played by the rules
i thought you did not
i am playing to win
winning is not everything
please do not tell me it is how you play the game
no after you
you do not trust me
i told mother i took care of you
you lied
drat someone wants to implicate you in this affair mrs peel any idea who
no idea who no idea why 
teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys all childrengs things 
 or grownups who still like to be children
quite any childhood friends enemies
his name's jones 'invisible' jones
why's he called 'invisible'
are not you coming
we must hurry mrs peel 
hurry  what for  i am just now 
there's a reception this evening colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend
that is that you are wearing
it is called black leather
what is it
limpet bomb small very compact from trubshaw's
when all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
you first
trubshaw again what now
they are playing your song mrs peel
bad news father's looking for you where are those bloody ministers
i will be back 
where are you going
laying in supplies mrs peel weather may get very nasty and i have no umbrella 
you need not bother i cannot drag you further into this after all i am still the chief suspect
oh and by the way i think it is about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder
mrs peel
what kept you
'the owl and the pussycat went to sea '
' in a beautiful pea green boat'
a fine night mrs peel 
still a bit chilly 
english weather you know after all we have been through i should say we deserve a long holiday 
have you any place in mind
i do not recall siberia being this warm steed
it is the latest thing mrs peel
our little paradise  just made for two
our chaperon
ah  sun tan lotion any shops nearby
your mission is simple find out how and why these agents died
think of it as special assignment mrs peel with a twist you are our chief suspect
where is mother
you do not believe him
ah here we are steed asked me to play a hunch  valentine peel
peter's brother  but 
now let's see  eton cambridge  research into robotics and plastics overtaken by peter's work on the physics of climate change 
i know all this
do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother inlaw was under surveillance
surveillance by whom
father she gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by dr darling
who's now vanished
makes two of us
i was getting to it
getting to what
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative 
under the circumstances mother did not see fit but i think i can get you in 
privately owned by 
let me guess  wonderland weather
very good mrs peel 
i shall need a small plane
you are not venturing alone surely
a series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns 
global warming
we know one thing that suspect was not mrs peel
oh hello 
we want mrs peel
how did you guess
you reek of mrs peel's black leather 
mother i thought you were burglars
weather's turning nasty
you did not come to talk about the weather surely
think she really killed those agents
something went wrong system malfunction explosion mrs peel had a narrow escape suspected sabotage nothing proven file still open
this man  did you see him
pity i was growing fond of mrs peel unfortunately 
guilty until proven innocent
i was hoping you could tell me
are you alright young man
cocky little bastard i hope he was a baddy
i feel sure of it
i am alice mother said you would be on your way mrs peel with you
you with mother or father
wonderland weather ltd

when i came back i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman
then why did you quit
brian that is wrong
 bullshit you knew what i told you was not ready for the papers 
i was doing my job
leave stephen out of this 
oh yeah he is the real fireman  who are you just another probie working for swayzak 
we still talking  look i am sorry about the other day 
swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered i want to know why he keeps that hidden
i do not know anything about it
you could check it would be in his files

i think your boss is going to need some spin control
i quit two days ago brian

i do not have the slightest idea
i will see ya around huh
brian mccaffrey  oh this is really a treat brian mccaffrey lost a dad to the animal huh

the outlets
who the fuck is doing this
oh jesus christ
i need another one sir
uh i am brian mccaffrey your new assistant
are you still here
get used to me inspector i am not going anywhere
then go find a corner i do not want you in my way
where are you going
uh i do not think that is in my contract
trychtichlorate is a binary structured 
 go to the bottom under heat properties
during heat episodes of 2000 kelvin or higher trych breaks down and dissipates will consume magnesium
but the right guess on this is arson
i do not guess
some people say you do not do much of anything when it comes to this case
that is why the sealant on the doors so what have we got a torch with a conscience
no we have a stone killer trying to make a point
are you going public with this
then who wrote the report
well brian i guess you can say it is arson now
just wondering
hi helen man you look great
about written you off how long have you been in town
four months
four months
that is sean jeez he is a giant
yeah you would be surprised what three years can do to a kid
sean come on out man what you forget your favorite uncle
well that is two things to strangle stephen for where is he anyway
oh man i am sorry
yeah big fan
and i am a huge fan of what you did to save that woman brian
uh i think there's been a mistake i did not save that woman
no need to be modest brian
every little boy's fantasy
brian let me come to the point i would like to offer you a job
mr mccaffrey
nice boat
completely out of control
are not you even curious
engine 115 right
how would you know these are supposed to be sealed
lucky guess  and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments
did not offer the kinda growth and challenge i need
uh huh and pioneer's pride mobile log cabins that was in your blood about six months was not it
management were pin heads
laguna jamming custom surfboards
coffee sucked
and just this year briangs sound spectrum your own company even big step
i was ahead of my time
who's going to die
brian he is not doing it right dad he never does it right
your brother's right if you do not fasten these correctly they could open and you would get burned
fireman shit
i hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it
stevie rimgale's here to see you
i am busy
he just wants to 
we gotta roll stevie
i will be there
they are waiting man
uh helen i wanted to talk to you a second about sean
you cannot talk about my brother like that
stephen what are you doing here
fixing my roof
where is sean
he is got piano lessons
oh yeah how is he doing
he is going to be a fireman
give up babe you cannot fight it believe me my mom tried
 you remember
yeah i just thought i should say i do not know something
the great communicator
sorry i hit jackson
he deserved it he was born deserving it
i treated you better
you want some coffee
coffee nah i gotta go
that is wrong stephen  c'mon you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind  how is brian doing
he is out
ah stephen that is what this is really about is not it you always have to be right
hey i am the first one to admit when i am wrong
i am sorry i could not sleep
cook and i are almost finished here have a seat
look i am sorry i 
 no that is okay it is just sean
 he is getting good on those eggs and y'know he told me he actually likes the piano

i would prefer you not use that word in my presence
delacroix i am glad you got your mind right
we are all happy to be here and i am going to paint a picture for you
so let's take this great form this very american tradition of entertainment into the 21st century into the new millennium
the name of the show
i do not know if whoopi is the way to go
that is a great handle
mantan and sleep 'n eat  two real coons  i know we are way out there but it is satire
every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons  mantan and sleep 'n eat  the dusky duo
what are there character traits
mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire
and sleep 'n eat is his comical sidekick
yep you guessed it
protest finally forced amos and andy off the air  could stop us from ever getting on
mantan right here is a gifted hoofer  he has educated feet
we gonna hit 'em wid da bomb dickey on dis' one  that is the setting
that iswhati amtalkingabout that iswhati amtalkingabout  he is off the hizhook
we think so
you are telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot
i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video
if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot
i am gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone
i do not give a good goddamn about finland norway sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from
they did not even view a rough cut just some scenes we quickly cut together
this has to be a big mistake
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier  from the gitgo from jump street
hold on a sec i got a call
hello mommy let me get rid of this other call
i gots to go it is my moms
what do you want
i want to speak with you
go away unless you got my money
son  good to seeya  good to seeya
it is been a long time
pull up a chair  oh excuse me this is my lady dot
good woman  i trained her right
daddy she is younger than me
purely for medicinal purposes
i did  i am not an alcoholic  i just like to drink
that is the only reason period they only want one certain kind of black comic
enough about me that is happening with you
dem white boys giving you a hard time
nuthing i cannot handle
the truth is never let them seeya sweat  you do that that is half the battle
where do you go from here
three nights charleston south carolina
i love you too daddy
glad to meet you too  you are all your father talks about
how long has my father been like this
not that often  he was excited to see you
so he drank himself into a stuper
the drinking is for the pain  it does not kill it just dulls it
do not tell him it is from me or he will not take it
he never showed it
how was it
why did not you tell me about this staff meeting
nobody told me anything
what good are you if you do not tell me stuff like this
how did you know
it hit me like a ton of bricks
how can this be  you and me at the same time the exact same thought it is scary
manray was under our nose the whole time
do you know how you will use him
what point is that
the point being that him the networks do not want black people on television unless they are buffoons
sounds risky to me
you getting cold feet
i am in till the end
good  i am going to need your support
you okay
what is your problem
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show
even if money was not an issue dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous
that is the chances of mantan being picked up
this is the group i was telling you about
which one is your brother
you have said that already
just want to say good luck
your life will never be the same
let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready
we both lied to him
what do you want me to say
same here
who's side are you on
what would their reaction be  i had not the foggiest
so you have your small victory now what
what is this
a gift
for what
the jolly nigger bank
i thought it was appropiate
how so
why would you do that
i do not want to hear it
how long have you and hambone been hanging out
you are the one that put us together we are friends
that crazy brother of yours does not think so
he is just playing big brother
oh is he  you getting jiggy with mantan
please do not go there
dunwitty and i feel you have been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
i cannot lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
this is crazy
that was a mistake but i do not regret it
the first and only time  a big mistake  i am gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore
otherwise  i trust you know the difference  you are an intelligent woman finished at nyu
dela kiss my big black ass
do not make me have to use this
i told you but you would not listen you never listened to me
yes your name
he i am mona
david i appreciate your comments anybody got an ideas  everybody just talk out loud
can i kiss you too
naw  i will take the zero
you feel good not nervous
i feel fine
not nervous  relaxed
so they can be on tv
you sound like the media
this is nothing  it will blow over by tomorrow
no joke  serious
hope the same thing does not happen to me  that is some big shoes to fill
you getting scared because some people do not like what you are doing
you should not even be mad at me over sloan
what you did is dead wrong
oh is it  buddy boy in this business if people do not produce they get fired
i do not believe it
mantan we got a show to tape
you must think i am some kind of fool
it looks delicious
you hear me talking to you  the only time you come up here when something is wrong
c'mon mommy do not start with that i am an ungrateful son stuff
it was  it is  but this is a different kind of show
if at first it is not what you want just work that much harder peerless
to answer your question there are a lot of negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons
peerless i did not raise a buffoon we have enough of those on television already
peerless your father called
he wants you to come and see him
he said that
yes he did
where is he
he is performing at some place outside of richmond virginia
richmond is not all the way down south
i do not even know why you are still concerned over him  daddy's not with you
regardless he still is your father
it is gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
you going to attack me too  the show is a hit  are not you happy for me
of course i am happy for you you have worked very hard for your success
not at all
you know how your daddy is
if and when he calls please do not forget to ask him if he is seen mantan
nice to meet you  if you do not mind me asking you  how old are you

aw c'mon
forget about me are you a puppet for dela
do not try to change to the subject
why do not you answer
i know i will not be your puppet
you can go now
good day to you young sir
good morning
where are you bound for
that is none of your business
both of us ride home with best here
there's nothing else for it  take your ground grogan  twelve paces i suppose
ten sir and make them short ones do you hear captain grogan
pooh  pooh  best you are joking
ah  you sly rogue i see that will influence you
the place seems more a farm than an innyard
upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly
i have acted as i think fit
good morning private james  please come in  i should like you to meet my uncle herr minister of police galgenstein
has he sent the challenge yet
this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family
dorothy might love me or not as she likes but best will have to fight me before he marries her
have you taken my message to him
the meeting is arranged  captain best is waiting for you now
my mare is saddled and ready who's the captaings second
and now you risk the same fate  if you are killed your mother is all alone in the world
i hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body
oh it is with pistols we fight  you are no match for best with the sword
not against castle dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown
is miss dugan well
there's only six miss dugans now poor dorothy
ah  i see  no i am afraid mine are the o'higgins of watertown
whom have i been harboring in my house  who are you sirrah
sirrah  sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland
you are an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
chevalier though i cannot say how i believe you have cheated me
i deny your grace's accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
i do not know
where is my rascal lazlo
good gracious  what is this
you are going to drive to the frontier
ten thousand  but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand
your honor must lower his voice
all europe shall hear of this
i have no luggage
you are the young man who m de seebach recommended
your name is lazlo zilagyi
yes sir
you come highly recommended by herr seebach
herr seebach was a very kind employer
for whom else have you worked
no one sir  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
who else can give me information about you
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
have no fear  it will come out well for me
i believe they will deport you
i have faced that problem before
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel  that should be work for a hangman
to risk one's life against such people is an imposition
i entered here monsieur at a bad moment for you it seems that you love this lady
very well  now that i know it i will no longer love her
then you yield to me
on the instant  everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs
that is a trifle strong
but for a time a passing fancy
not even that
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
not one
have you not a man whom you value
that man has perhaps not yet been born
what  you have not met a man worthy of your attention
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more  i could value only someone whom i loved
it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
i agree but god put us on earth to take that risk
a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws
i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
how so
you want my heart
it is my only object
to make me wretched in two weeks
to love you until death  to subscribe to all your commands
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
and if she does not choose to show you some kindness
yes  but i am afraid of being deceived
poor man  and for that reason you want to begin where people end
lady cosgrove you are an old fool
i feel the ribbon
why are you shaking
i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set
i would draw my sword and cut my way through them
i am at your service mr cosgrove how much do you wish to spend
as much as possible
as much as possible
yes for i wish to entertain splendidly
all the same you must name an amount
last month the duke of suffolk spent no more
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus the thirteenth earl of crabs
does this assignment interest you
was he cheated
a meeting with the prince of turbingen is impossible
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country
then this must be done tomorrow
but i should not like to put you to such trouble mister
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill  are you serious
may i be quite frank with you
did you buy the horse papa
now just have a little patience my boy  your birthday is not until next week
but i will have it on my birthday will not i
good night papa
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolangs farm to see him
your bother is in america fighting the rebels
is he all right papa
would you have me spend my life all alone
in truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
good evening mr james have you done with my lady
i beg your pardon
charming schuvaloff
blackeyed sczortarska
dark valdez
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
yes  he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
and he does not care about me
he is only curious to know who you are
if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
he loves me as i love you
great great that is fantastic
hey kid your friend just made himself a star
see the big guy likes it
i just saw the woman i am going to marry i know it but then i lost her
tough break most men have to get married before they lose their wives
i am going to spend the rest of my life looking for her that or die alone
i know her uncle friends of the family
who is she where does she live
did not kill anything did i
a few rabbits but i think one of them was already dead
her name is sandra templeton she is going to auburn the semester's almost over so you better hurry
thank you
welcome to ya that is your name
you were expecting me
now tell me if that is not the best pie you ever ate

it makes it faster if i do not speak to the men they fall faster it is pretty obvious why
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me
why else would you send off for me if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
you must think i am the biggest pillock in the world
no i do not
in the world
i know you just want to punish me 
i do i want to very badly
so you are just going to be vindictive
in every sense if at all possible
you cannot hurt me more than i am hurt already
i am going to be sick where is the
what no you are not
i am going i am i am going to be sick
you do not have to do this i can look after myself
give me some money
so uh alexei which i know is not his name
it is none of your business
so uh
look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
oh jesus
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
of course of course of course he does of course thank you thanks
not the kids type then is he not that broody you must be pretty miffed
he will come back
excuse me
he left me my passport and ticket it is pretty clear he wants to see me again
yeah i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too
i do not want to talk about it
why not
shut up i am not listening
we will pretend it never happened
so that is it like having to fuck men you hate
and what are you saying
and it is wrong
and who says what is wrong
and that would be morals that would be one's own moral sense of decency
that is a moral orgasm john tell me how it feels exactly
so what then you just detach sex from everything
whereas wet 'ng wild is an emotional journey tied and tethered it is pretty moving huh like anna karenina
sometimes which
sometimes neither
some what does that mean
there's nothing wrong in liking sex john
so now you hate all women
i think it is my safest bet do not you
i got what i paid for
it was not what i wanted
so what did you want i think we understand each other no
you do not understand me
excuse me
get out
you are throwing me out
you know in russia there's no work for women it is a different world
you do not have to say anything
what i i was not saying
please there's no oh
i was not saying anything
fifteen you do not know him he was very kind and strong
yeah he is a smashing bloke
the rest of the world john it is not all like st albans

i think you might of dreamed this one anthony
as part of his plan i do not know why

the point is the killer always goes may i speak to starsky he says his name
what does starsky say
he says this is he
this is he
did you see what i meant about the window
kind of except we have already got the keys
that is true but what if they change the locks
would they do that
now that window can never be locked it is impossible
she is really kind of hot
it is got a v8 dignan
anthony we will get two hundred for the coin collection alone that is less than what it is appraised at
but dignan do you really know that much about rare coins
the list dignan i know you remember the list because you signed it things dignan was not supposed to touch
where are you going
i do not appreciate you ridiculing me
did you see that
yeah i saw it
i am lookout
dignan it is got an alarm
i do not think so just reach on in
that sets it off
it had an alarm
yeah i heard that
holy shit what would i tell you
eight dollars
but he did not say anything
loop around real fast
you think we are going to be chased
now one thing we need to discuss is timing timing is absolutely crucial what are you doing anthony
anthony give me the fucking gun
dignan calm down
you are out i am not working with either one of you
calm down take a deep breath
where is the manager
where is the other stocker
there's another stocker right
is that the manager
holy shit
i swear to god in a very quiet voice
like he would find dignan one day
that is wrong with him
what do you think
anthony he sat in the car and watched a 411 in progress he got what he deserved
can i get that credit card from you
i do not like to use that credit card dignan
why not
because my mom gets the bill
she is not going to notice anthony
i do not want to use it
well then cut it in half
i keep it for emergencies
see if mine are in there
dignan those are not running shoes
yes they are
look at the treads on those
what about them
they obviously were not designed for racing
do not call me spoiled dignan
i will just say it
i will say it
ok go ahead
look man she did not know anything about shirts
no i am not saying her i am just saying i do not know
armored trucks are very difficult to steal anthony
i know but once you get inside you are home free
right get back to me on that one once your plan is worth a shit
no dignan i am sorry i cannot do that
i thought you guys went to get your hair cut
inez this is 
what the fuck is going on here
what that is the matter
anthony we are on the run from the law here did you tell these people your real name
no i did not dignan they do not speak english
they do not
no not really inez speaks a little
which one was that
she is from cuba
he needs to hire an attorney
as long as he gets out ok
see now we have got a plan
after that my parents never let me go to dignangs again
but if it was not for dignan i probably would of died
he is gone he stole the car
where was it parked
that coward son of a bitch
he went back for his brother
we said 48 hours
when would he tell you
this morning
where was i
you were asleep
he told you and you let him do it
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go
if you wanted to go what were you going to do just leave me here by myself
bob went to help his brother i understand that and i cannot help it if you do not
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob i would be dead
i did not realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself dignan
we are going over to this bar if you feel like going
i cannot believe he just jumped you
i wish i would been there
inez has a master key to all these rooms does not she  does not she
i do not think we can do that
i know we can it is real simple we go into a room grab some car keys and 
what i am saying is she would not go for that
she does not need to know
no one to back me up now i have a good idea so unless you come up with something better 
i do not think we need any keys dignan i think i can hotwire a car for us
you do not know how to hotwire
yes i do bob taught me
bob taught you how to get electrocuted
i think we better go home
do not panic anthony
i am not but there's 
you cannot just run home every time things get tough first of all we have got enough dough to

i guess what i am trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan
and you are wrong if you think i would turn my back on a friend
congratulations you passed the test
what do you mean
that was a test
how does that feel
did dignan take the test
yes he did
no that door over there
i do not want to die
the fear of death the pain of consciousness  did you mix this martini

what the fuck is dignan doing with that cop he loves them
there's a million places to hide around here
oh yeah they will never catch the guy
i hope not
why do not you just tell them the truth those belong to my neighbor phil
i do not know i personally do not need that shit in my life right now

you think he got my license plates
how long are they going to hold him
anthony i 
bob where you going
i am not playing any more golf
why not
cause i am not getting any better it is a waste of time
you have only been playing for two weeks bob it takes a long time to learn this game
you think i am improving
you do not have to talk about it if you do not want to
no i do not mind
i know it must of been a bad experience but it does not sound like it was your fault
that is pretty complicated for a senior prank
why were you drawing the holy mary
i thought he did not have to pay anything because of the technicality
yeah but he still has the aggravation three days sitting in a cell
were you adopted bob
why do you say that
well because you guys do not look alike
was future man adopted
let's not even talk about it
yeah let's keep it 
give him a second

like silk
nice to meet you applejack
i can knock a man out with a six inch punch
what do you mean
where would they come from
the front stairs
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car it does not make any goddamn sense
just settling an old score you might say revenge
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that will land us in jail
we might have to take that chance cause i feel pretty strongly about this
is that him
that is anthony
wait did he see us
i do not know why the fuck we are having a party the damn job's not over yet
well this is not really a party per se
are you a fag
dignan and anthony this is little richard he is crazy totally nuts
it seemed like a good idea at the time
well what do you think
i am not allowed to drive those
i thought your parents were in italy
they are
so who's going to know
he looks like he was designed by scientists for desert warfare
that never would of 
if you are that worried maybe we should just steal one
what are you talking about bob
you stole a transam
yes i did
ok bob
it is true dignan
well what do you want to do you want to steal one or just drive your car
how much could you grow realistically
as much as i want when these plants bud i will probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed
six thousand dollars come on bob
if it is that easy why does not everybody grow them
do not you guys tell anybody about my plants
you are paranoid bob
what was that all about
i cannot believe you said that
what did i say
the guy is fucking insane
i warned you dignan
you said it like it was a big joke bob like he is wild
no i was saying crazy like a lunatic
i know that now he is a fucking psycho
well do not blame me i told you
where would she go
i think we might of scared her
that is my responsibility
i am paying attention i just want to look at it for a minute
that is your fucking problem you are a shithead
i paid for it
you know bob anthony did kill someone he electrocuted our janitor senior year
his name was swifty

it is registered in my mother's name
what the fuck possessed you
bob are you coming
you can go first bob
my brother's in jail
the weed
but it is not his how can they arrest future man
i do not think they can make it stick bob i mean what do they actually have on future man
well the marijuana crop is a good start
that could be anybody's
they also found my two beam scale in the garage
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house everybody has a scale
the cops say it is a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana
so tell them the truth what do you use it for
how long has he been in there
i do not know
then how come they have not set the bail yet that is unconstitutional
what do you mean get back
well obviously we got to go back
bob that makes no sense
dignan he is my brother i cannot just leave him there
this could be a trap
come on dignan
do not come on dignan me
i am going back
not in that car you are not

give me the keys dignan
i cannot do that bob
dignan you are going to give me those keys or you are going to get hurt

i have been given nothing god makes men what they are

fine speech now what do we do

mrs treborn i need to speak with you
i was going to show this to the principal but i wanted to talk to you first
and you say he does not remember any of it
a journal just have him write down everything he does
and the bad news
unfortunately we have got nothing to work with it is harder playing detective now
but you must have something to go on
if i had to guess i would say the blackouts are stress related
come on i doubt the answer's that simple
you would be surprised how often they are
evan wake up oh please wake up
actually these tests were not available twenty years ago
no dances just tell me
we are gonna be late again
when did you ever care about getting to school on time
rightytighty leftylucy

oh he is just like any other man only more so
no i mean is he trustworthy is his word 
 now just a minute who told you to ask me that
he did captain renault did
i thought so where is your husband
yes i will bet
he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
does he know that
oh yes
and he is still willing to give you a visa
yes monsieur
and you want to know 
 will he keep his word
you want my advice
oh yes please
monsieur rick i 
you will find a market there for this ring i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice
thank you but i hardly think 
what is your name
such a bargain but that is your decision
mr berger the ring could i see it again
yes monsieur
i recognize you from the news photographs monsieur laszlo
in a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
monsieur rick may i get you a cup of coffee
no thanks carl
well you are in pretty good shape herr rick
how long can i afford to stay closed
oh two weeks maybe three
maybe i will not have to a bribe has worked before in the meantime everybody stays on salary
now you finish locking up will you carl
i will then i am going to the meeting of the 
 do not tell me where you are going
the police break up our meeting herr rick we escaped in the last moment
yes i come
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance it might attract the police
but sacha always puts out that light 
 tonight he forgot
i want you to take miss lund home
excuse me monsieur rick but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs the cashier would like some money
well i will get it from the safe
i am so upset monsieur rick you know i cannot understand 
 forget it emil mistakes like that happen all the time
here you are
it shall not happen again monsieur
here's to you sir
er good luck yes
i would better be going
er my check please
er goodbye sir
hello rick
hello ferrari how is business at the blue parrot
fine but i would like to buy your cafe
it is not for sale
you have not heard my offer
it is not for sale at any price
what do you want for sam
suppose you run your business and let me run mine
suppose we ask sam maybe he would like to make a change
suppose we do
i see the bus is in i will take my shipment with me
the bourbon  the news about ugarte upset me very much
practically no one
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
and the carrying charges
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
i will tell him when he comes in
rick i will put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
that is why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place
shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough
hmmm i happen to know that he gets ten percent but he is worth twenty five
and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i do not sell
of course they stay rick's would not be rick's without them
do not forget you owe rick's a hundred cartons of american cigarettes
yes something
do you know where they are
it was gracious of you to share it with me good day mademoiselle monsieur
and mademoiselle
mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
that is also true except for one destination to return to occupied france
occupied france
uh huh under a safe conduct from me
what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
there are only two other alternatives for him
what are they
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
and the other alternative
 it was la belle aurore
how nice you remembered but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris
i remember every detail the germans wore gray you wore blue
say goodnight to sam for me
i will
there's still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam
who are you really and what were you before what did you do and what did you think huh
we said no questions
a franc for your thoughts
in america they would bring only a penny i guess that is about all they are worth
i am willing to be overcharged tell me
why i am so lucky why i should find you waiting for me to come along
why there is no other man in my life
uh huh
that is easy there was he is dead
i am sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions
richard they will find out your record it will not be safe for you here
my germangs a little rusty
with the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love
yeah it is pretty bad timing where were you say ten years ago
ten years ago let's see  yes i was having a brace put on my teeth where were you
was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding
strange i know so very little about you
but be serious darling you are in danger and you must leave paris
no no no no we must leave
yes of course we 
oh i saved my first drink to have with you here
no no rick not tonight
please do not do not rick i can understand how you feel
huh you understand how i feel how long was it we had honey
can i tell you a story rick
has it got a wow finish
i do not know the finish yet
i am sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night
well you can tell me now i am reasonably sober
i do not think i will rick
all the same someday you will lie to laszlo you will be there
how did you get in
richard i had to see you
you can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters
it was your cause too in your own way you were fighting for the same thing
richard richard we loved each other once if those days meant anything at all to you 
 i would not bring up paris if i were you it is poor salesmanship
 all right i tried to reason with you i tried everything now i want those letters get them for me
i do not have to i have got them right here
huh but it is still a story without an ending what about now
now i do not know i know that i will never have the strength to leave you again
all right i will here's looking at you kid
richard victor thinks i am leaving with him have not you told him
no not yet
but it is all right is not it you were able to arrange everything
everything is quite all right
but why my name richard
because you are getting on that plane
i do not understand what about you
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life
hello sam
it is been a long time
yes ma'am a lot of water under the bridge
some of the old songs sam
where is rick
when will he be back
not tonight no more he ai not coming uh he went home
you used to be a much better liar sam
leave him alone miss ilsa you are bad luck to him
play it once sam for old time's sake
i do not know what you mean miss ilsa
play it sam play as time goes by
you are very kind
this time they really mean to stop me
victor i am afraid for you
i must find out what berger knows
be careful
we are only interested in two visas signor
please ilsa do not be hasty
he does could we have a table close to him
what happened with rick
our faithful friend is still there
victor please do not go to the underground meeting tonight
did he give any reason
he suggested i ask you
ask me
yes victor i was
i know how it is to be lonely  is there anything you wish to tell me
no victor there is not
yes yes i know victor whatever i do will you believe that i that 
be careful
are you ready ilsa
he came from paris with rick
rick who's he
mademoiselle you are in rick's and rick is 
hello rick
well then perhaps you also 
i am afraid major strasser would insist
how do you do
how do you do
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
and about victor laszlo everywhere
and i congratulate you
what for
your work
thank you i try
i hope we did not overstay our welcome
we will come again
good morning
good evening
good evening you see here we are again
monsieur blaine i wonder if i could talk to you
go ahead
well is not there some other place it is rather confidential what i have to say
what of it
is not it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs
i appreciate it but i do not accept it
i will raise it to two hundred thousand
my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
there must be some reason why you will not let me have them
there is i suggest that you ask your wife
i beg your pardon
i said ask your wife
well this might come in handy
thank you
had a close one eh
you love her that much
monsieur blaine i do not know how to thank you
i brought the money monsieur blaine
keep it you will need it in america
but we made a deal
oh never mind about that you will not have any trouble in lisbon will you
no it is all arranged
everything in order
all except one thing there's something you should know before you leave
i understand
i am captain renault prefect of police
let us say that it is my request that is a much more pleasant word
my bill
well a precedent is being broken er emil
ricky you are becoming quite human i suppose we have to thank you for that mademoiselle
tomorrow at ten at the prefect's office
i am delighted to see you both did you have a good night's rest
i slept very well
that is strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca
may we proceed with the business
with pleasure will not you sit down
i am afraid not my regrets monsieur
and the honor of having served the third reich
monsieur insofar as it is in my power 
 thank you
i believe you have a message for him
i have never accepted that privilege and i am now on french soil
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
this is hardly the time or the place
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefect's office with mademoiselle
for the time being
unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca
thank you captain it is very good to be here
what else my dear major
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
oh there is no hurry tonight he will be at rick's everybody comes to rick's
good evening gentlemen
thank you it is a pleasure to have you here major
champagne and a tin of caviar
may i recommend veuve cliquot '26 a good french wine
especially so tonight major in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers
rick this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others
well personally major i will take what comes
ho diplomatist
rick is completely neutral about everything and that takes in the field of women too
if rick has the letters he is much too smart to let you find them there
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that he is just another blundering american
as to laszlo we want him watched twentyfour hours a day
you see captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe
but everybody's having such a good time
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
but i have no excuse to close it
what is the meaning of that phone call
why do you stand here why do not you stop him
hello louis
you know i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh
the plane to lisbon  you would like to be on it
why that is in lisbon
it was a combination of all three
and what in heavengs name brought you to casablanca
my health i came to casablanca for the waters
waters what waters we are in the desert
rick there's going to be some excitement here tonight we are going to make an arrest in your cafe
what again
if you are thinking of warning him do not put yourself out he cannot possibly escape
i stick my neck out for nobody
how observant you are as a matter of fact i wanted to give you a word of advice
yeah that is his name
victor laszlo
rick that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed
it will be interesting to see how he manages
manages what
his escape
oh but i just told you 
 stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
this is the end of the chase
is that a serious offer
i just paid out twenty i would like to get it back
done no matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or i should say two
why two
he is traveling with a lady
maybe he is not quite as romantic as you are
it does not matter there is no exit visa for him
louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
and got well paid for it on both occasions
the winning side would have paid you much better
maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
i have my orders
yeah you were saying
oh how do you do
that makes rick a citizen of the world
well you were asking about rick and here he is mademoiselle may i present 
oh no rick never 
louis are you provichy or free french
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
as i suspected you are a rank sentimentalist
yeah why
why do you interfere with my little romances
how can you close me up on what grounds
and i am taking a friend with me one you will appreciate
it certainly would germany vichy would be very grateful
i see how do i know you will keep your end of the bargain
oh thanks
you are late
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel so i knew i would be on time
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs
you know this place will never be the same without you ricky
yes i know what you mean but i have already spoken to ferrari you will still win at roulette
i have the letters right here
tell me when we searched the place where were they
sam's piano
 not so fast louis nobody's going to be arrested not for a while yet
have you taken leave of your senses
i have sit down over there
i suppose you know what you are doing but i wonder if you realize what this means
i do we have got plenty of time to discuss that later
if you do not mind you fill in the names that will make it even more official
you think of everything do not you
well i was right you are a sentimentalist
well rick you are not only a sentimentalist but you have become a patriot
maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses
our expenses
uh huh
where were you last night
that is so long ago i do not remember
will i see you tonight
give me another
sacha she is had enough
rick i am sick and tired of having you 
come on we are going to get your coat
make it official if you like
what is your nationality
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation
there seems to be no secret about that
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris
well there are certain sections of new york major that i would not advise you to try to invade
aha who do you think will win the war
my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one
in this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
you will excuse me gentlemen your business is politics mine is running a saloon
i would advise you not to interfere
put that phone down
get me the radio tower
uh excuse me please hello rick
well what makes you think i have not
oh nothing but when you first came to casablanca i thought 
may i too bad about those two german couriers was not it
they got a lucky break yesterday they were just two german clerks today they are the 'honored dead'
i forgot you never drink with  i will have another please  you despise me do not you
i do not mind a parasite i object to a cutrate one
well rick after tonight i will be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca
who did you bribe for your visa renault or yourself
for how long
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
i do not want them here overnight
rick rick help me
do not be a fool you cannot get away
sam ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot
i like it fine here
he will double what i pay you
boss ai not you going to bed

they want to replace me the board of trustees wants to *replace* me
they just want you to hire some new help
he will need clothes some money
let him try to *make* some money that is part of seeing the world is not it
oh just stop it you knew this was going to happen he is a young man
he is still a boyout in the world he is still a boy
he is a goddamn psychiatristof *course* he wants to help he would be happy if he could help *commit* me
you *invented* him you have completely made his up
wilbur he picked them for us himself
i suppose it would not hurt to *meet* him that is his name again
dr homer wells
he *sniffs* that ether i have seen him do it
it is because he is too tired to sleep he has to
he *smells* like he could put you to sleep
he is a doctor busterdoctors smell like ether
*you are* a doctor homeryou do not smell like ether
i am *not* a doctor i have not been to medical schooli have not even been to high school
but you have studied with the old man for *years*
i am *not* a doctor
i mean your parents
i know who you mean i think about leaving here but not to find *them*
yeah but sometimes i wish i could meet mine anyway
what for buster what would you do if you met them
uh i would like to show them that i can cook a little
you cook very well
and that i can drive a truck
better than i can
homer you know i would never kill anyoneyou know i would not
i think mary agnes could kill someone
that is she so emotional about
what would she die of
what are you going to tell the little ones
i will tell them fuzzy was adopted
why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him
they will believe it because they want to believe it
should not we tell homer
daddy it is a letter to *me*
he mentions homer too you know
it is getting late i think i will pack it in
how about him not needing the frigging compass how about that
good night kids do not catch cold it is getting cold already
so mrs
is your family in the apple business too
no but i work therei like it my dad's a lobsterman
i know
he is going to be dropping bombs on mandalay they are going to be shooting at him
i cannot have a baby alone i do not even know if he is coming back
i guess i will see you around the orchards thanks for everything
so not bored yet
i better go
a movie *outside*
yes but it is closed all the time now because of the blackout
people watched the movies in their cars
when they watched at all do you like movies
you have seen only one movie which one
but you looked as if you liked it
first she loved him then she did not then no one else could have him
and what did she die of exactly
she was torn apart she died of a broken heart
that is the *medical* explanation
you are a natural you were born to drive a car like this
the screen is enormous imagine king kong up *there* have you seen a lot of movies here
at least you were never lonely
you do not miss it
i miss things i miss people  i miss reading to the boys
but you had so much *responsibility*
i never *asked* for any responsibility
privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies
sometimes movies mostly bore wally
ahha  so what is thata radio
how could you not *care* about the movie
you just cuddle you come to hug to kiss you do not *come* here to watch the movie
that is what *i would* come here for i would watch the movie
just tell me do you want me to go do you want me to stay
it will be okay
*what* will be okay
olive told me  you might have told me yourself
so we should wait and see for how long
i grew up with wally i began my adult life with him
fine that is all there is to it then
no that is not all there is to it i love you tooi *know* i do
okay okayi know you do too
i told her she does not feel she can do that something about her father not letting her go anywhere
she will not go to st cloud's
well we cannot force her it is her decision
you do not understand it is her father
mr rose *knows*
wait *wait* are you sure
is not that like waiting and seeing
no nothing is nothing i want wally to come home i am afraid to see him too
i know  is *that* nothing
stop it just cut it out
you got up you *did* something if you keep this up you might be in danger of making a *decision*
i know i am sorry
he is *paralyzed*
he is *alive* he still loves you  so do i
please do not make me say it again
please that is enough i *loved* you tooyou know i did
did well okay
please do not
and now that wally's coming back and because he will certainly *need* you
do you think she will be all right
i know you do not think much of being needed or of me for that matter
i am sorry for what i said about wally needing you it was unnecessary
no i am the one who should be sorry you have every right to be angry
how is that wally doing
i have got some more clothes for you i just keep forgetting to bring them with me
you ai not been through what i been through candy
i know where you can go homer and i can take you
you can trust me is it jack it is not jack is it it is *muddy* is it muddy
so many children are they all orphans
wally thinks apples are boring
i never said they were boring
you said apples are not exactly flying
there you said it was boring
i love you wally
i was just showing homer the orchards kind of a geography lesson
you have been giving him a *flying* lesson
he thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches
i thought they might take me
they wanted a girl
you are one of the best curlywe could not let just anyone take you
dr larch would not let just anyone take *any* of us
that is true
nobody's asked for me have they
nobody special enough curly
you mean somebody asked
her temperature is a hundred and four
homer wells born portland maine march 2 1915
homer was born *here* in what was it 1922
you mean they will replace you with someone who will not perform abortions
so here is my candidate what do you think
or that he cannot be bothered to write us a proper letter a dissertation on apples we do not need
he probably does not make much money picking appleshe must have had to pay to send them too
i just wanted to ask you
edna come dance with me let's be foolish tonight
is *your* father dead
cirrhosisit is a disease of the liver
*liver* killed him
*alcohol* killed himhe drank himself to death
but did you know him
barely it hardly mattered that i knew him
did you know your mother better
she is dead now too she was a nanny
that is a nanny do
she looks after other people's children
did you grow up around here
no she was an immigrant
that is an immigrant
homer does not king kong think the woman is his *mother*
uh surethat is what kong thinks all right
uh it is the end of october
do not get too excited fuzzy
did you bite it
i do not remember
it looks like you bit itit will be all right
maybe i was kissing someone and he bit me
no you did it yourself maybe in your sleep
i am sorry they are not used to seeing a car like this
so now uh you are not i mean do *you* do the
no dr larch will be performing the procedure
what kind of plane are you flying
have you enlisted
they would not take me i am class iv i have got a heart defect
has anyone offered you anything to eat
i wonder if you might give me a ride
sure be glad to uh a ride where
where are you going
i think i would probably like the apple business
you are a little overqualified are not you
no i am not i need a job
i do not *have* any time there's a *war*
burma run because you fly over burma
at what altitude
what lousy lucki mean your orders to draw an assignment like that
uh look if you are serious about wanting a job picking apples is not that boring
it is almost like flying
what about the trees
well sure that is good then  all i mean is i am lucky i met you
slow down homerdo not be in such a big hurry
this is easyi am not hurrying
i think you been staying up too late at night homer
you are actually having sex with your own little girl is that possible

christ it is oil of tansy

i have not either but you *will* the morons who write the books should do a little research *here*
but is not fuzzy just well underdeveloped
where is the name sheet
nobody's named this one yet
he does not like it  he is a boy that is why
cannot a boy be a dorrit
i do not think so
henceforth you shall be little wilbur
okay he is just a wilbur then
i thought it was my turn
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with
it is just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people
in other parts of the world i suppose there are other ways
you know i am grateful for everything you have done for me
i do not need thisi know all about my condition
what i mean is i would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here homer
i think wally will be fine mrs worthingtonhe seems indestructible to me

you ever see a palm tree homer

thanks for playing along i just have to sit for a while
my name's grant grant ashby
do not tell me you started a tech firm here before us
no no nothing like that i work in a bank
oh well thanks for the drink
uh right and that was it that is when we decided to start our own business no more shithead bosses
what do you do over at your bank grant
maybe you can help us understand that is so hard about getting a corporate loan
well typically speaking they are not as long as you can demonstrate 
a capacity for gross fund recovery yeah we got that part
that is right and tech firms they 'tend to scare people off
they scare people off because most people lack vision vision and balls present company excluded of course
banks need to know how they are going to get their money back
we know exactly how we are going to make the money back there in lies the catch22
and you have this letter of intent
we had to finalize the deal
everything looks in order
this has to happen fast
i know it will not go unnoticed
that is this
let's just slow down for a second
then there it is ashby gets the itch
the standard ten
ten percent of how much
same thing with playing a con you have to be able to see that deep
hey jake when am i gonna get to play the inside
gordo plays the inside you are the shill
and i think it is because of this redhead
know who i am jake
the antichrist
things are probably going to end badly for you jake
gee what makes you say that
your life flashing before your eyes
just the last three weeks
we cannot all be model citizens such as yourself
it is all about the money is not it
keeping the fix happy
you never know when you can use a crooked cop
keep going i want to know how you got lionel dolby
so you want to know how to play the big con
i can see why you liked her
but there were other factors
you are a superstitious fucker
luck's a funny thing especially the bad
so much for honor among thieves you would have cut loose your friends your girl
we were back on
after you cut her loose
alrlght alrlght what happened today
alright turn around she does not get shit unless i get that money where is it
it is like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark
like putting on a play guess some people forgot their lines
guess so
we will take care of it
ten is standard sir
we sure big al threw him to us
whoa what
fuck that we are going too
the red hair it is bad luck
masters of our own destiny
i am going home
moonan here shit

you will be there
so that is it
then he had to bang it out across the street at the bank of the caymens
you ever use the bathroom in kennedy
i have a good crew
i guess it lacks a certain style
of course your line of work's only as good as the people you find
you cannot cheat an honest man
you cannot cheat an honest man but a man like lionel dolby
honest mistake just give me the money back and all will be forgiven
i cannot do that
why not
let me rephrase  i will not do that
let me repeat  why not

pinback i have a computer reading of nine five seven seven
well now what what do you have for us now boiler
not much nothing at all in this sector
find me something i do not care where it is
well i show a 95% probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula
fuck that shit
all right then
sounds good chart a course for the veil nebula
why does not talby ever eat down here with the rest of us
quantum is up thirtyfive
rechannel all safety relays 
talby talby can you read me
can you beat that i always knew talby was weird
energy shielding positive function
swell let's synchronize detonation time do you know when you are supposed to go off
check at six minutes
one hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
energy shielding positive function
do you remember the detonation time
detonation in twenty minutes
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
therefore i shall ignore you
hello bomb
false data can act only as a distraction therefore i shall refuse to perceive you
hey bomb
snap out of it bomb
hey bomb
hello bomb are you with me
of course
are you willing to entertain a few concepts
i am always receptive to suggestions
well of course i exist
but how do you know you exist
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
hmm well i think therefore i am
that is good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists
why that would mean i really do not know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
that is it
intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
why do not you have more time
now bomb consider this next question very carefully what is your one purpose in life
to explode of course
and you can only do it once right
that is correct
and you would not want to explode on the basis of false data would you
of course not
well then you have already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
yes well
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
so if you detonate in
nine seconds
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
i have no proof that it was false data
ah what would you say pinback
mafhkin oble groop
ah what was that again i still cannot hear you
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction
yes doolittle
i need a computer reading on a fail safe mark
in a second
new star  hey guess what i got a new star on the readout
which one
another unknown not on the charts a red dwarf
any planets
yeah eight it says here
any of 'em any good
the new star what are you gonna name it
commander powell would have named it
hey doolittle think we will ever find real intelligent life out there
out where
veil nebula
mark at 54321drop
 open circuit breakers 
 remove thrust drive repellant 
hello pinback are you there
i need a diameter approximation
you know talby you really ought to eat with the rest of us you spend too much time up here
i like it up here
you know what i think about talby
i am getting something here on this readout
it is funny but i kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself
i cannot seem to locate the malfunction exactly
waves would be peaking really high and glassy hit that water riding the wall just perfect
somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
ah doolittle i do have a malfunction on this readout but i cannot seem to pinpoint exactly where it is
do not worry about it we will find out when it goes bad
i really think i should try and locate it immediately might be something important
lieutenant doolittle this is talby lieutenant
ah lieutenant doolittle sir
sh talby do not bother me now
ah well i think i have found the malfunction sir i am in the emergency air lock
not now
doolittle help me
oh yeah
it is doolittle it is the phoenix they glow with all the colors of the rainbow just like everybody said
no kidding
doolittle you must tell me one thing
that is that sir
tell me doolittle how are the dodgers doing
well sir the dodgers broke up disbanded over thirteen years ago
ah pity pity
yes sir negative effect
what was that doolittle
negative effect
it did not work
that is correct sir
sorry doolittle i have forgotten so much since i have been in here so much
what should we do sir the time is running out
commander powell commander hello
doolittle hello

good morning sir
you have acquired a taste for this
it is quite nutritious sir
no sir he is got bronchitis and he is been badly beaten
why is not he in the general ward then
well sir he is quite seriously deformed and i fear the other patients would find him rather shocking
deformed is that it then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable
yes i am well aware of that but this case is quite exceptional
oh is he a friend of yours
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital
ah no sir i had planned to see them in the morning
a few words i thought he was imbecile
singularly unpleasant chap uh i do not suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your patient mr treves
thank you very much sir shall we say in a few days then
shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon
wh whatever is most convenient for you sir
two o'clock then you know treves it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance
oh yes
how did you know the rest i never taught you the rest of it
i do not understand
treves well done
can you imagine what his life has been like
yes i think i can
do you think they will go along with us
but he is so afraid he is going to be carted off i have promised him that will not happen
well i will let you know if there's something in the afternoon post
do not you think this is a bit premature we do not have the backing yet to
how are you feeling today

oh i could not do that the blacksmith's code says
if this is the age of ragnarok keitel blacksmith it is good to us
cannot make enough swords
they chase fenrir the wolf from the sky
the age of ragnarok ends
the bottom falls out of the sword business
it is not just your livelihood that is at stake but your songs and the livelihood of all blacksmiths
my brother blacksmiths

the blacksmith's code says i must
honour and protect all blacksmiths
together we stand

it is a tradition
i know dad
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair
you went berserk
i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king harald
so did your father
so did my father and his father before him
but it is a responsibility

it is easy for you to be patient
where is reed
what are you doing here
i am worried about you
about me how sweet

what is this where is reed
reed said it would be weeks till 
he could not generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass yet another mistake for mr fantastic
i will be watching over you
deb it is me i need you to step out front
oh my ggg what did you do to ben
what did you wish for honey
he is financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century
i cannot take this
what about his first born
he knew about nasa what if he made the call to shut us down 
ben think about all the people we can help if this works 
maybe you should think about yourself for once you always let this guy push you round 
we got what we wanted that is enough
cannot do it i cannot do it
they crashed it into a wall a flight simulator
when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do
five times
i had it at four
is not that your speech
he is made a few changes
this is your dream reed you should be the one up there
i ai not done arranging your flowers egghead
how long was i out
i do not know i just keep going over and over the numbers
reed even you cannot compute every little thing
you go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life
yeah you and debbie and perfect 
what come on she is got a good thing with victor 
i am sorry did that cosmicbath loosen your screws
he is smart powerful successful 
are you alright

it is about to be a broken face
we are working as hard as we can 
time for your lesson vic chem 101 what happens when you supercool hot metal  ben
ben i have been crunching the numbers on the machine i think if we can rework the power settings

'course not strictly business
yeah well his eyes say different
put your tiny little mind at ease
where where am i
back on earth victor's medical facility we are in quarantine
reed sue
they said that is not such a good idea the shock alone could 
hey that is a prototype
the machine works and vic's gone mister hyde on us 
no more cracks about how i look
your tissue your organs your entire biophysical structure is changing every system is still functioning somehow 
and they are changing into
i do not really know a compound organicmetallic alloy stronger than titanium or carbon steel harder than diamonds 
like the shields reed said would protect us  how long
at this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks 
but this disease is progressive degenerative
you are hot
so are you
i mean you feel a little feverish
i have never felt better in my life when do you get off work
my shift ends at four but i could not 
me likey
stay right left is trouble
i though we went over this
you are on fire
not this again 
victor's right johnny get to the command center close the shields
he is not responsive 
now what is up with that
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna
oh you dawg you better not be my nurse
this is wrong in so many ways
ben grimm is a genuine american hero who's been through a terrible orde
twenty from outside the place looks a lot taller
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes
this place is deluxe you got cable
back it down johnny
is there something about flames about flaming that you 
what are you trying to say just because i dress well and like to dance 
he is right these costumes are missing something i cannot put my finger on it 
johnny supernova
the synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to 
apparently i can disappear
stop it
what is that thing
wait you mean there's chance we could be fullon247fantastic
grow up johnny you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
you are really cramping my style here
i am driving
you are gonna pay for that pebbles  what
you two need a timeout
is that what you call it real
johnny slow down think you know mom did not raise us to 
i am sorry sis for leaving you guys 
what are you doing 
sis let me take care of you for once
if reed's right then this little trip will double our stock offering
and if he is not
our numbers are through the roof the ipo's tracking at fifty sixty a share the bank's five times oversubscribed 
it is not just the money i could make money in my sleep
then what is it
leonard how is the feed
how is the ipo
stable we are looking at low twenties it is a good number considering the fallout from 
reed's disaster you know i half think he did this to me on purpose
actually uh people seem to think the scar humanizes you
you know maybe you should get some rest 
yes sir you have got the mayor at eight then a ninethirty interview with the journal 
front page
you are you have i mean how have you bee
those solar winds are flaring but i factored them into my coordinates and 
i uh think i remember the number
material made from selfregulating unstable molecules i have been working on a formula for this
feeling better
yes thanks
that is good that is uh good
you are happy for me and victor
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship 
uh sue i cannot
what what do you mean you 
it has to be the cloud it is fundamentally altered our dna
sue your clothes lose them
how come ben cannot turn it on and off like us
that is what we are here to find out
you should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better 
anger rage frustration
okay is there any way to duplicate that feeling some memory or
i mean you broke up with me right
are you kidding
reed i was ready for the next step you were not ergo i walked
i think it was a little more complicated than 
if we can build a machine to recreate the storm we can reverse the polarity 
and reverse the mutations 
but we are the focus right reed reed
of course of course
and you sure you can control this thing last time did not work out so well
reed how close are we to a cure
do not let victor push you into making a mistake 
he was going to take away all my data equipment 
which is why i am working twenty hours a day checking every variable 
every variable but yourself you do not eat sleep you cannot live in your head like 
i could get ben to tap into the baxter's main power to generate enough voltage 
remember our first date here god i was so nervous
you know i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late
when i walked out i waited ten minutes outside your door ten waiting for you to come find me
why did not you say something
i can make it work
reed stop you need to rest your 
the power i need more power to control the storm 
sue i need some of that anger rage frustration 
i found a broken gasket from space 
this is not going to be a problem is it
you back this mission and i will sign over a fair percentage of any applications or 
bengs still out there 
come on ben come on
not until ben is back inside
just a little banged up a couple scrapes why
ben did this
ben did this
i am starting to wonder the same thing how much do you know about what happened to you
did not go as planned it was a catastrophe you ruined the lives of four people 
what are you doing here
it is just business
surprised i agreed to reed's proposal
i understand the business reasons
what are you doing
raising the shields
that is going on
victor i am sorry i 
victor your scar 
i told you i am fine it is you i am worried about
you said it was urgent
he is working round the clock but the data needs to be tested analyzed before 
please do not make this personal 
oh i think you already have
reed's gonna fix me up

jordan  might we do this over lunch tomorrow  i do very much want to talk but now is scarcely 
did you set me up  did you set me up just to see me fail
what changed
should probably ask him that
you do not know that
you promise wickwire a fast ticket too
i have had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began  and that is quite verifiable
i am sure it is
you will think about my offer
so she picks the women we pick the programs  seals
i would go special reconnaissance every bit as tough  and we have a 60 percent dropout rate among the men
montgomery why do they call you flea

halfway 'round the world  so that is the problem  we can get the team in just not out
unless you whiskey run
you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bareback  is that correct o'neil
that was good headwork lieutenant
thank you sir  we hear back from the pentagon
probably hear back from cnn first
hate this part  just sweating it out on the sidelines
so why are you even considering it are you
just like you would be
specrecon  those guys are world class warriors  and they will not want you there jordan

john james urgayle  the chief

would you have shot if it was a man
that is not right
that is what your crew said  are they lying  or are you
we did not know we were compromised firing would only have given away our position
did not you know you would be raped if you were captured  did not you even think about that

what does that mean
maybe a few times i have
really you ever been arrested
i have been picked up a couple times loan sharking racketeering but i was never convicted i am clean
because i need half a million to buy a script
for a movie
a blockbuster but quality no mutants or maniacs this one's gonna be my driving miss daisy

two time academy award nominee martin weir
martin weir he played the mob guy that turned snitch in the cyclone

i am not gonna pop her harry
you do not even know these guys
harry i probably know 'em better than you do
what do you get out of this
i do not know maybe i was not clear but i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut

yeah ray he personally told me he got killed in that get away airlines' jet went down last month

yeah that was a good party
so you do not know what i am thinking
no i do not though i have to say i am curious
so you want to know
if you would like to tell me yeah
i am thinking of a movie
one of mine
one we are producing
martin i am not connected to those people anymore not since i walked out of a loanshark operation in miami
what happened the pressure got to you
guy owes me fifteen large and takes off i go after him the fuck you think i do
martin look at me
like this
what you are telling me you are tired you wanna go to bed
wait how about this
how about this
that is not bad
that is what i think of you asshole nothing
i believe it
i turn it on when i confront the guy
yeah but you have not found him yet  the guy took off for las vegas
the wife sues the airline  this is a gutsy babe
at that point basically that has to be it
very nice
yeah i like it i am high up i can see everything you know it is the cadillac of minivans
whatta you think chill
i did not know where else to keep it  where would you
you are here a while that is wrong with a bank
they report it to the irs
you have been losing
i am up twelve grand today
from when you left vegas with four fifty
how would you know i was here
i would not let her if she tried why i am here leo basically is to save your ass
how by taking my money
you can keep what you won today that is yours
it is all mine
you take all my money but you are borrowing part of it
but you will not know where i am i do not even know where i will be
mr barboni is a good customer  works for jimmy capp
the door from the patio in back
you broke in
no it was open it was not locked
the interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand
that is right three percent
hey karen how ya' doing
what are you doing here
i wanted to come by apologize for coming into your house like i did last night
yeah well make sure you lock it on the way out
rough day on the set
i spent all day crawling out of a grave the costumer kept bitching 'cause i was ripping my nylons 
ripped nylons work makes the shot more real
that is what we finally decided
yeah that was a good scene i mean for a horror movie
how come you stopped making movies with harry
i married martin that was a full time job
you read harry's new one he says it is the best thing he is ever read
he must mean after slime creature 3
tell you what i will stop by harry's office and pick up a copy for you
well i gotta have a talk with leo my runaway dry cleaner
you been here the whole time
i got you a copy of the script
i already read it harry left a copy at the house
i think it is not horrible
i do not like the title or the main guy's name
then you have read it
not yet
you and harry will make a great team  i am gonna make a deal with him
sounds fair
that why you came over here to ask me that
i want to know
why does anyone want to be in movies
this thing's actually accurate i bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on sunset
well actually martin the movie we came to talk about is mr lovejoy
a locker at the airport jesus christ harry tell me you are not really that stupid
that was martin he wants to have lunch tomorrow that is if you can make it
how would you meet martin anyway
not unlike the way nicki met him except it was a wrap party why
i do not know i am just having some trouble seeing you two together
so what about your story you thought of a title yet
how about get shorty except that is not a movie that is real life
i think you could be an actor i know you are acting sometimes but you do not show it
you thought i was faking
you do not mean a movie star more like a character actor
harry my god
what kinda food they serve at this ivy place anyway
harry what are you doing you are supposed to be in the hospital
you sure
he is doing the same thing you did to him playing letterman on tv
it is not dave it is a movie
are you going down
i do not know
you are as bad as harry
you okay
karen what the fuck are you doing
were you scared up there
you bet
you do not act like it
i will be right back
what took you so long
they are closing the granview you know theater down on biscayne
yeah the guy owes momo a few g's
you sure it was ray bones took the coat
that is what the guy said
that is the dumbest thing i ever heard where do you sleep
i told you not to 
you said do not say nothing and i did not
how would he know i was in vegas you tell him
he already knew it
yeah well i am in la now
whatta you doing out there
i am going into the movie business
what are you talking about you wanna be a movie star
i am thinking about producing
how you gonna do that you do not know shit about making movies
i do not think the producer has to do much outside of maybe knowing a writer
yeah but whose point of view
whatta you mean whose point of view the audience's point of view
all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene
yeah what three words harry
hello doris
well are not you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like
i am not sure how i feel about this doris
you seem to feel fine about it
i mean morally murray was my friend
that is wrong
be quiet and listen
i do not have a dog
you do not what happened to muff
with your experience you could always become an agent right harry
yeah that is what we need more agents
well i got an audition tomorrow
what i am saying harry is i want you and your new buddy to get out of my house
harry what are you still doing with those guys
karen wow look at you
lufkin his agent
yeah karen knows him
i have to consider i mean as the mob guy this is another mangs wife i am sleeping with
arctic warrior arctic warrior arctic warrior this is united states coastguard station north island over
north island i wish to declare myself salvorinposession under section four two charlie of the international maritime convention
affirmative arctic warrior what type of vessel
a passenger liner over
a passenger liner north island over
affirmative arctic warrior please advise your salvage authority pending registry check over
north island please repeat over
roger north island i am tied to the passenger vessel chimera and she is afloat repeat she is afloat over
roger arctic warrior i say again our records indicate the passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea over
roger north island please advise pending further information over
arctic warrior arctic warrior arctic warrior this is united states coastguard station north island your radio check is affirmative over
hear that dodge epps do not think it is a problem
looks like epps' gonna get some tonight
hypothetically speaking what if we get this boat to sitka and find out somebody wants it back
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away
you think the extra strain caused it
how about now
sixty pounds
what you sure
that is what it says
take it easy dodge it is only a piece of metal
damn mind of it is own
that is so great about sweden
yeah but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about
i ai not no mechanic just so you know
what day is it
i do not know tuesday
when they find out what it is carrying they may not be so interested in that is legal
the turbine blew
you would think on a ship this size there would be something left to eat
where from
one more
supposing one of those cables breaks under tow
nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either
last thing we want is extra partners
this's gonna hurt a little
what other choices have we got
guess i will just keep working
what are you crazy
light in those passages ai not so good
maybe that is his boat
fifty million dollars fifty million we gonna let this guy just take it from us one guy
so we kill him
one guy is not gonna be so stupid
pretty handy with that scatter gun epps you raised on a farm
i am no doctor but i would say he is in a coma
other than the obvious there's nothing wrong with him that i can see not on the outside
try wednesday
did you
what say epps you up for some roasted albatross
get up
you are not jealous are you dodge
if you get it back in one piece
with a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make sitka in five days without another stop
mother fucker
what is it
the number one turbine's pretty well trashed number two runs but it is way underpowered
how long to fix
that is this
turbine rotor's shot
i thought you said it was just a blade
metal's crystallized gotta replace the whole deal
how much longer's that gonna take
like i always say 
i know i know two ways to do anything 
the right way and the wrong way
but how long
hard to say
we gotta get outa here dodge a storm blows up and we are history
i am telling you you do not want to be running that fan like it is
what about running number two by itself
it is a full 2500 horses down we could not drag that boat down hill on ice with it
how long then
i gotta pull the blades and reseat everything in a new rotor  
how long
three four days
went aboard
it is a hell of a lot of money
did not happen yesterday i will tell you that torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat
or somebody stopped them
so what are we gonna do that is the big question right
a salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself it is ours
then we are rich we are damn filthy stinking rich
you gotta be kidding what the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks
yeah yeah i am on it
i am buying me a nice outrigger spend my time hauling rich seattle business men through the puget
dreamings all any of you are gonna be doing if we do not get this boat running
sounds like the hull
if somebody's aboard her already she ai not ours she is theirs
bullshit that boat has not made steam for fifty years we found her she is ours
and what do you propose that we knock this guy off
what if that fucker finds it before we are ready to go
bodies are too fresh
damn barbaric is what it is
that would be my guess
cannot you use something else
i might be able to find something on the ship but it is gonna take time
you better get down here quick skipper i am on c deck cabin 400
what is it
on a passenger ship in 1953
what do you propose
just what the hell do you think you are doing
i do not know what you are talking about
i think you know
the radio
take it easy willya what about the radio
do not lie to me
what the fuck  
you did not want us calling anybody too liable to ruin your big payday
i did not touch the fucking radio  ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat skipper
conveniently enough for you
what the hell happened
that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants
if money can buy what he wants
i do not figure there's much i want money cannot buy
that is slow
morning everybody
show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you epps
showed him a hell of a lot more than that
could be a fishing boat
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass
you mean before she sank
then why did not they take it
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold
that is what i call a payday
that is a good thing
stay away or else
sudden flashes of light
i do not even want to know what that is gonna taste like now
you okay
the law's on our side if they want to challenge it let them try
she was sailing up north right
so what did happen
nobody knows there have been a lot of theories of course but we will never really know for sure
you are more practical than superstitious
maybe they did not want it back maybe the whole fat deal was insured
why not call for help
take it easy you will live longer
the guy he just came this way
what guy
there's somebody else on this boat
what what the hell are you talking about
i saw him just a minute ago some guy
are you sure
of course i am sure i saw him
you sure it was not me
so we find this guy and make a deal with him
no cowboy shit up there understand
you just shoot at something
he needs a doctor
how is he doing
same any luck
you are saying they mutinied for the gold
if they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats
smashed it up pretty bad
the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill
february first
the same day she supposedly went down
their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision distress calls have been made
collision with what
the page's missing then their sos was real
but where is the damage
maybe the other ship took the worst of it
it is a good bet they will be asking a lot of questions when they get here too
it is not gonna hold us
could not sleep
what do you think happened on this boat
i guess that is the sixty four thousand dollar question is not it
are we smart enough to avoid that
when you found me yesterday at the pool i would seen something  someone
not our mystery guest again
what like some kind of ghost
maybe hallucination is the wrong word it was more than that as though they were showing me
showing you what
what happened
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks
no i think they are were just passengers innocent victims
victims of what
something bad happened here murphy
that much i think we have already established
that is that supposed to mean
why you how come the rest of us have not seen these people
murphy to epps
epps over
epps you there
what do we do with him
what do you think
could be a stroke who knows  the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves like wild dogs
over the gold
they went crazy
hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water
what happened
we are in an island chain it is only a matter of time before we hit another one
and now you are gonna kill me is that it
i did not want it to turn out this way
murphy do not you see that is happening
i think i see it pretty well
it is the ship the ship's making you think this way
i do not give a damn about the gold
of course they did
let the buyer beware
not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia
he will sell the scrap for three times what he paid
i must be in the wrong business
you got that right
red sky at night sailor's delight
too deep to anchor out there
call the coastguard
it is funny
how is that
whatever the reason she is adrift and abandoned we have got every right to salvage her
you mean tow her back that is a thirty thousand ton ship you are talking about
you are up late
how much you figure that is worth skipper
hard to say maybe forty fifty million
if they thought it was lost at sea they probably just wrote it off
so what we gonna unload the gold and get a move on
yeah but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka
i heard that
what now
we could call for help
fifty million four ways that is twelve million and change a piece  what you gonna do with your share skipper
i do not know
let's just take it easy here alright nobody's gonna kill anybody
holy shit
never been more thirsty in my life
how are you feeling
what happened
you do not remember
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera down somewhere in there scavenging around
you have been out for about a day
say what
oh man
we heard you scream any idea what you might have seen
we are not gonna be able to pump it
getting a little hot under the collar i would say
shut up
it is a noaa buoy
a what
we are still drifting
he took the shotgun and a light
cannot find the shotgun
so whoever did this now has our shotgun
what about the gold
leave it
now hold up just a minute let's be reasonable here
you think whoever did this is reasonable
what seems to be the trouble ladies
as i said what seems to be the trouble
did not you hear me grandpa or you got your hearing aid turned down
these ladies was having themselves a discussion and you are interrupting it
you got about two seconds to get your paws off me tarzan
i thought you say tuesday
better late than never
that is this
you got a leak in the number nine compartment
no no you got leak
you pump it out and reseam the hull she will be good as new
that cost me twenty grand at least
fifteen at the most
you are kidding right
you were contracted to work
malaria epidemic very sudden
let me see the sick
oh you are a doctor now too
there is no reason for fear
he sees this chaos he will replace you all
morning friend glorious day
the next time will be as this time the devil has come to tsavo
that is ridiculous talk and you cannot seriously believe it

most certainly absolutely yes
excellent decision  your name is abdullah i am sure we will meet again go and enjoy the splendid morning
starting now we attack them
build the bridge over the tsavo river and be finished in four months time can you do that
i am sure you have examined my record so you know i have never yet been late on a bridge
you have never built in africa
but i have in india every country presents problems
pleasant journey
lovely sound they seem happy
do not they though
awhile back he ordered some bibles  i have brought them  is he here
yes he is
it is what the natives are calling the lions  two lions have been causing trouble
that is the surprise in that this is africa
it has not been that simple so far
and it worked
understand i had help
this sham ridiculous who needs it it is only being built to control the ivory trade make men richer
you are certain about tomorrow  but you do not seem excited 
you do not enjoy killing do you 
you never had it
then he feasted on him starting with his feet
please you need not be so graphic
that is a terrible idea
is it i am sorry but then of course you are the doctor you should know
i have been desperate for patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived
i tried to be late john it would have been easier if you would gone
we are not much good at goodbyes helena
tell me about beaumont does he understand how brilliant you are how lucky he is to have you
oh dear  you are geting that downtrodden look again
go now  such a gentleman 
very good indeed
not once you did not hit it once
anything special about them
samuel is camp liaison absolutely indispensable the only man here everyone trusts
excellent could i see the bridge site 
finish your tour
and anxious to get started  what is this mostly malaria
i do not suppose i could watch
might be exciting for you
i have never been all that adventurous i would not be in the way
i would love the company and i have hunted all my life
i am sure you mean that to be comforting but
you will have to deal with it nigel
since you would only been here three hours when we met are you sure this is how you hunt lions
one shot
with much more on the way  john we could have had this chat on flatter ground
how lucky we are
all right thee second embankment will go there 
john it will not be easy
but you said they were always old
what a good week
i did not have a chance to thank you
what did i do
got me out of trouble
nonsense samuel would have done something 
actually no
all right let's go into battle  i am redbeard 
that is very considerate
have you got it
i can try
samuel says you killed a lion
misfire it jammed
has it ever done that before
think about something else
have you ever failed
meant to ask you the railroad car trap your idea  excellent notion i used the same device myself once
but of course yours worked
what happened to them
their den  have you ever seen anything like this
where could it have gone how could it get across the water  they are only lions yes
i will have to
i cannot control mine i would be lost without the shame factor driving me
it is certainly the best chance they have had to kill you
you think they will come then  why
how many do you think they have killed
i never thought i would say this but i am glad you came
understood you realize now you could never have done it without me
why do the workers look unhappy
it is all wonderfully under control samuel you have done a splendid job
thank you the truth is this you have to work at it constantly
did it look like this in your mind
i am also liaison between these two
what are they looking at
oh yes i think so 
for you
thank you samuel
good news
i expect so it is from my wife
do you love her
i do actually very much
you like him do not you
oh yes but it takes time
you have known him long
thank you  why does he need you by him
three years i have worked for the railroad now i do not know why it seemed a good idea once
where is it
afraid of lions
why do you laugh you do not believe she taught me
how many cattle
four should do it
why so many
did you ever see a lion that size
where do you go next
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas you
some mysteries should not have solutions
are not you glad we waited
i do not know  it probably would have been the same
roy  your clock broke
nice going honey  it was brand new
now where are you going
to the bathroom where do you think
is it a star
ready  what is it
ummm  figure eight
incredible  five for five  you are not cheating on me here are you
no  they are just coming to me
well i guess some people have it and some do not
do you think i have it dr venkman
eight o'clock
oh dana it is you 
hi louis
 i thought it was the drug store
oh dana it is you
hi louis
hey it is crazy in here  you are missing a classic party
fine louis  we will stop in for a drink
are you the gatekeeper
oh sure  i am getting used to this
i am innocent  honest dana  i never touched you  not that i remember anyway
hello  i am peter venkman  may i help you
yes  well  i am not sure  what i have to say may sound a little  unusual
we are all professionals here miss 
 and then i opened the door again but it was gone  there was nothing there
why would anyone make up a thing like that
is that your professional opinion
you play the cello  it is my favorite instrument
really  do you have a favorite piece
i would have to say prokofiev's third concerto
that is a violin concerto
you really do not act like a scientist
no  what do i act like
like a used car salesman
well let's check it out
you are quite a housekeeper
i told you i 
are you all right
there's nothing there now and i do not get any significant readings
this is terrible  either there's a monster in my kitchen or i am completely crazy
if it is any comfort to you i do not think you are crazy
all right  what do you want to do
i think i should spend the night here
that is it  get out
i want to help you
i will scream
do not scream
then leave
okay okay  but if anything else happens you have to promise you will call me
all right
great rehearsal
you heard it
you are the best one in your row
most people cannot hear me with the whole orchestra playing  you are good
i do not have to take abuse from you  i have other people dying to give it to me
i know  you are quite a celebrity these days  are you here because you have info  about my case
who's the stiff
the stiff  he happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man
he is a very close friend  do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment
yes but i have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant
you must have gotten the last copy
well the name zuul refers to a demigod worshipped around 6000 bc by the  that is that say
hittites  the mesopotamians and the sumerians  zuul was the minion of gozer
gozer  he was very big in the sumerian religion  one of their gods
that is he doing in my refrigerator
i am checking on that  i think we should meet thursday night at nine to talk about it
hey dana  what is it  what happened
we must prepare for the coming of gozer
okay i will help you  should we make some dip or something
do you want this body
well i will just use it for a while and get it right back to you
actually it is more of a policy than a rule
i am zuul  i am 
right  you are the gatekeeper  but i want dana  dana speak to me 
there is no dana  i am zuul
nothing  we just got rid of that thing in your kitchen
really  is it gone
yeah along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions  this one took some work
this is going to cost you you know  our fees are ridiculously high
this is preposterous  i demand an explanation
fine  this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities
that is one speedy mutt
he is a big one  you do not want to mess with that particular breed
well that definitely looks like marshmallow to me
yeah it is some kind of mallowtype substance  that is for sure
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street
i wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area
hello i am roger delacorte  the head librarian  are you the men from the university
yes  i am dr venkman and this is dr stantz
thank you for coming  i would appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly
that is that got to do with it
did you see it  what was it
you are very handy i can tell  i bet you like to read a lot too
i collect spores molds and fungus
oh that is very  unusual
i think it is the food of the future
die in what sense
i want you to have this 
what is it
it is a souvenir from the 1964 world's fair at flushing meadow  it is my lucky coin
i do not believe in luck
keep it anyway  i have another one at home

i am not at liberty to say
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them
in a storage facility
and would this storage facility be located on these premises
yes it would
and may i see this storage facility
no you may not
and why not mr venkman
because you did not say the magic word
and what is the magic word mr venkman
may i please see the storage facility
go ahead  get a court order  then i am gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution
have it your way mr venkman
the man is a psychopath your honor
mr mayor it is a pretty simple choice you can believe mr pecker here 
that is peck

well just 75 more to go  that is this one
two wavy lines
hey  i am getting a little tired of this
you volunteered did not you  are not we paying you for this
yeah but i did not know you were going to give me electric shocks  what are you trying to prove
i am studying the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability
i will tell you the effect  it pisses me off
hey mister  can i see those guns
they are not guns  they are particle throwers
yeah yeah  i just want to see 'em
were you recently in the bathroom
what on earth gave you that idea
the wet towels residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair the redness in your cheeks indicating 
you are a regular sherlock holmes  now what do you want
oh  you are here
what have you got egon
spengler are you serious about actually catching a ghost
generally you do not see that kind of behavior in a major appliance  what do you think egon
something was definitely here
do not cross the beams
why not
trust me  it will be bad
it is peter egon  i have got a problem
what is it
i am with dana barrett and she is floating three feet off the bed
all right  i will try
i will spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning
he wants to shut down the storage grid
where is the keymaster
of course  ivo shandor  i saw his name in tobings spirit guide  he started a secret society in 1920
you talked to gozer
what now
on the count of three  one  two 
no  you said crossing the beams would be bad  it will kill her  and us
life is just a state of mind
i just realized something  we have never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment
sorry buddy
ray  where are you  are you all right
it is working
set entry grid
i have got to sleep
what happened
what do you mean by seen
looked at with your eyes
well i was at an unexplained multiple highaltitude rockfall once
what is it
i told you it is real
what do we do now
i do not know  talk to it
what do i say
anything  just make contact
hey lady  lady  can you talk  who are you   this is not working  think of something else
you said you floored 'em at the regents' meeting
for what purpose
you will never regret this ray
my parents left me that house i was born there
you are not going to lose the house everybody has three mortgages these days
but most people are afraid to even report these things
everybody can relax  i found the car  how do you like it
do you think it is wide enough  how much
why do not i check out the building  it may have a history of psychic turbulence
how was your date
they will
so do i
no sense worrying about it now
ray  something's here
where are you pete
third floor  get down here
sit tight  i am on my way
it is here ray  it is looking at me
do not move  it will not hurt you
how do you know
boy that was a rough one
egon how is the grid around the storage facility holding up
who was the architect
it does not seem to have slowed him down any
agile bastard is not he
i could not help it  it just popped in there
hey man  what is it you are so involved with there
uh  oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barrett's apartment building  and they are most unusual
me too
boy  solid cores of shielded selenium 325
do you believe in god
no  but i liked jesus' style
me too parts of the bible are great
the whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesiumtungsten alloy
ray do you remember something in the bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves
and the seas would boil 
right  and the sky would fall 
judgement day 
yeah judgement day
you do not have to worry about that with us sir
stantz  you okay in there
that is he talking about  choose what
where are we now commodus  can you see the camp  my gods  the air is turning into ice
we are nearly there lucilla
that is what you told me two days ago
will you please get back in your wagon  and stay there
more wine sister  surely you can drink more than that
quite so  narcissus and his courageous men may they live long to serve rome
do not you think you should at least wave
they hate me they really hate me do not they
did narcissus die today  was not this his day to die
it is disgusting  animals  i had to come here under armed guard  slaves  get this junk out of my sight
how about in the forum  right in front of the senate
if i may be so bold
for the gods spit it out
kill him  tribuus  execute that bastard
tribuus tomorrow
where have you been
taking my pleasure  do i need to clear my lovers with you
you must start clearing everything with me  especially your lovers
why are you so surly  you have won brother  the people have bread and the city is quiet
what is that wailing
what are you talking about
now that we are done with that infatuation forever
if i ever loved narcissus it was not like you want
tell lykas to send a retiarius and a samnite to help tiger
you cannot do that listen to the mood of the crowd
i want that bastard dead
you want control of the crowd  you cannot get it by killing their hero
i am their hero
not yet dear brother
lykas pick a man  someone who will look good  jerses i want it built up in the daily action
damn him  i should have killed him on the front  i let you talk me out of that
respectfully caesar quintus and i must report
do you expect marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience
that is difficult to say general
then you would be out of a job
gladly caesar
i back rome against all her enemies  if that answer disappoints you i am not a politician
i would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is
you and my father have become very close  perhaps one day i may say the same for us
you flatter me caesar
i am ordering a general standdown in preparation for withdrawal back across the danube
they will not break this one
where is my family
cooperate and they will be returned to your estate  i could have executed you
caesar ignore them
ignore that  the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better
gods of hell  this must cost a fortune  how many days is this going to go on
and like children everywhere they scream freedom the most when they desire it least  i beg you please continue caesar
yes  you know that is not a bad idea
maybe it will crush gaius
i am serious
take grain away from the army
caesar let me sponsor your first wager in the arena
marcus aurelius has died
we must obey our emperor and the senate
this is the only place in rome where i thought  i believed  i was wholly in power
where is my father
tribuus what happened in the arena was narcissus killed
why is not he dead  damn you you promised me he would be dead
yes caesar
tribuus  go left here i want to see my new statue at via claudia
yes caesar
cos what in hades is the emperor up to  and do not tell me you do not know
i do not know
agh  please  he is having a secret device constructed for the circus the brass craftsmen are working overtime
my birth sign is water bearer twentyfifth day in the month of janus
i have read of it
the trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is
who are you  narcissus the good  i have heard of narcissus meridas that is who i hear you are
you are hearing about somebody else
how did you get condemned to the arena without a trial
when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial  you would have to give me your word
i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing
you are a citizen and a soldier  not a gladiator
you on your way to trial too general  or do you think they have already had our trial
why you
my loyalties were in doubt
fools to let us both live we will be our own best witnesses at our trial
is this rome  are we just going to be executed
no futuretelling please i have been terrified enough for one day
you know our two most senior senators  gaius cantus and falco verus
i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities
i am not fit for the job and as a matter of fact i am not taking the job
why do you keep playing at being so humble  it is a little embarrassing
it is my brother's neck you want not mine
i came here to see that you stay alive  the people need a living breathing alternative to commodus a hero
you mean a symbol of someone who does not exist
you cannot die
would that marcus had lived
marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son
he killed his father and then my family
commodus it is we who are going on the offensive
i want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign
servis made it through again
marcus you honor me but i am a soldier politics scare the hell out of me
the senators admire you
i made the plume from a quail feather
as soon as i can
on your honor as a roman officer daddy
i see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army
why do not we try to keep politics out of the conversation
everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal
what deal
rome is going to pay tribute  like a defeated nation begging for mercy have you told your troops that
my troops do not make policy
you brought the army into rome
i was summoned
he is very realistic
what about their philosophy lessons
they are studying with cynics
you need to come home
i can see that
i am a soldier  we are at war  i cannot stay home tending the damned olive groves
let him trust quintus
quintus is overly idealistic
i do not even want to imagine the things you have seen
you teach them
you are a legate in the roman army huh  and you act like one what was your crime
condemned  are not i owed a trial before being condemned
general all i know is you have been condemned to the colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen
take your hands off me animal
i refuse to be your slave  i refuse 
i am not a gladiator  i refuse to fight
general do you realize what happened out there today
i did not get killed and everyone else did
what would the poster say narcissus would kill for a taste of golden pompeii olive oil
proximo if this is her doctor he is an assassin
tiger's challenged you and jerses has made me an offer made us both an offer  you take a fall
so i pretend i am dead  you get gold what do i get
you get to come alive again in the country
as what 'the galloping gladiator'
on you  of course  you are my bravest fighter  the best fighter i have ever seen
how much money is involved
a great deal  they designed and build tiger's chariot
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right they do not waste time
i can really rape them on this  can i at least tell them you will think about it
no  tell them i will do it  but i want more posters all over rome
fantastic  wonderful  but posters are very expensive
then get a large cash advance
right right but they will have to bring in a lawyer  i do not want to get sued over this
before they leave get gold
right right what am i thinking of
you were a soldier and then a gladiator were not you
i want nothing to do with the arena
do you want some dinner
why not
benjamin  do you dislike me for some reason
no  why should i
will you take me home now
i am sorry i took you in there
i think i would better go home now please
but elaine

that you are afraid 
wait a minute
now  do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time
if you want
good i mean are we dead or something
well i just do not think we have much to say to each other
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together
are you tired of it
i am not no but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then
well what do you want to talk about
anything anything at all
do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences
how about art
art that is a good subject you start it off
do not you

no think of another topic tell me what you did today
do you really want me to
yes i do
do you want to hear it or not
yes but you might try and spice it up with a little originality
i got up i ate breakfast and went shopping during the afternoon i read a novel
what novel did you read
there is not any
how do you get out of the house
i walk out
what do you say to him
benjamin this is not a very interesting topic
please now tell me how do you know he will not wake up sometime and follow you
because he takes sleeping pills he takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock
but what about the noise from the car what if 
the driveway's on my side of the house
we are talking mrs robinson we are talking
calm down benjamin
now let's keep going here
no we do not
well how long has this been going on
about five years
you have not slept with your husband for five years
now and then he gets drunk a few times a year
how many times a year
on new year's eve sometimes on his birthday
man is this interesting
is it
so you do not love him you would not say you 
we have talked enough benjamin
wait a minute so you would not say you loved him
not exactly
but you do not hate him
no benjamin i do not hate him unhook my blouse
well how do you feel about him then
i do not
well that is kind of a bad situation then is not it
i never did benjamin now let's 
why did you do that
see if you can guess
well i cannot
think real hard benjamin
i cannot see why you did unless you did not have to marry him or anything did you
do not tell elaine
oh no you had to marry him because you got pregnant
are you shocked
well i never thought of you and mr robinson as the kind of people who
all right now let's get to bed
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances
not particularly
what was your major
why are you asking me all this
but i thought you  i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then
kind of
well how did it happen
how do you think
i mean did he take you up to his room with him did you go to a hotel
benjamin what does it possibly matter
i am curious
we would go to his car
oh no in the car you did it
do you remember the make of the car
oh my god

it was a ford benjamin
a ford a ford goddamnit a ford that is great
that is enough

why not
i wish you would tell me
there's nothing to tell

do you understand that
but why should not i
i have my reasons
i would not know
well i am not
you are not
no sir i am not proud that i spend my time with a brokendown alcoholic

do not you expect me to be a little hurt
mrs robinson you stand there and tell me i am not good enough for your daughter
did i say that
you would not
what are you doing
well it is pretty obvious you do not want me around any more
well look  i was kind of upset there  i am sorry i said those things
if that is how you feel 
but it is not
that is all right i think i can understand why i am disgusting to you
oh no  look  i like you i would not keep coming here if i did not like you

how old is richard
pd says 41 but he barely looks 30
he would want to know about all this
mr congeniality  let him find his own clues  there's a journal article in this somewhere
i warned you
does not have a head does he
did not look like it came from toysareus that is why i called you
did not think it was my buddy over there
you are the expert
you are very macabre
it is my birthday
would you like more tea
do not know about any of that suppose nobody does
i do not follow you
poor little tyke did not have a chance  hopelessly premature  he died a few days after he was born
would you remember his name
this is against the rules
so's playing choochoo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of
okay okay
taupin richard marshall  born march 16 1945 in church hill maryland  received first driver permit 1967 in philadelphia
church hill that is pretty close is not it
miss cartwright what is it i can do for you
i would like to ask you about the claymore
it is not mine
basil the ii
good reflexes
someone beat you
have you taken to touring small town cemetaries miss cartwright
people like that rarely leave business cards
you have an active imagination
i have friends
jesus christ
you will be safe here  he will not kill in a church
who is he
at the moment  carl smith
what will you do now
you need not worry miss cartwright i have been at this a very long time
he called you macleod
not your concern
i left a man dead in felton  but you do not really care do you
that bothers you
he was innocent
he is dead  whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now
i am a witness to a murder  that seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list
why not  i am sure they would love to hear your story
i would rather hear yours
you are being foolish
i am a historian mr taupin only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face
he sees me as a threat
no one knows you are here
no  i had to talk to you
you had to do _nothing_
you are wrong
is this what you killed them with
you have been listening to rumors
our cars were seen together in felton  they are calling me an accessory to murder
that is all that
you did kill those men
not all of them
when you finish what then
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr taupin
the estate stuff is pretty straight forward  just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat
it is some sort of party the town is throwing
they do it each year
maybe it would do us both good
here try this  i suppose they are still making women the same as back then
it is beautiful
i do not know any of these  i will make a fool of myself
then you must be at least 70 years old
at least
it is frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives
a factor of age
i hope i never get that old
i see
i am not even sure why
you are a very perceptive young woman
who are you
that would be difficult to explain
he knows about you
he is older than i
that is insane
perhaps  there is something more an inheritance
of bodies
i did not kill the watchman
you killed those other two
not the same
what about that family in '31
there are differences
you kill with your left hand
i have not killed _you_
do not
come here brenna
but you are known so much history i will only read about
it is all the same  half lives that never go away
what is it you want
gettysburg's an hour's drive at most  you should be back by nightfall
will i see you again
that is wrong
what is it
the inheritance
life  it is the gift and the under standing of life
forget it
i am just curious
are not you getting a little old for this  you flunked out of law school
now there's a new topic
i have got a morgue filling up with bodies  that is my right
i am calling an attorney
you and i should talk first
all fashionably without heads
you are an asshole moran
i want taupin
that is all of this got to do with me
what were you doing in felton
research  if your pal was there i never saw him
i have witnesses that can put the two of you together
never take up poker detective
come on brenna your ass is already in a sling do not drag me into it
corey you _owe_ me
i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts too bad no one else did
it is bullshit  everything my job the people i get involved with i am up to here with it
who is it
someone should check him out maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over  he has one he might have two
you see that desk  _your_ desk  you see the crap piled up on it
requiem acer'nam donaei
what are you doing man
et lux perpetua
you will not be bringing the church into this
be quiet
juan cid romirez  chief surveyor and alchemist
you are not from these parts
i have not much to offer mr romirez from spain but you are welcome to that is here
your back it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle
five years past me clan fought another over some thing i cannot even re member
your marks would suggest great injury
i was nearly killed
i did at that
i was driven out
and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew
how can you know this
you scots have a way with game  it still has life in it spirit  back home the food is sodomestic
why are you here
i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con sultant on matters of metal
you know me home  me name
you are the same
do you ever feel a flow as if some thing were pushing against you
yes  always
does it change with me in the room
it is less
you feel you know me
i do not know why
i do not understand
you are still so very young
i am twentytwo
listen to me  hear the words
this is madness
three days you have laid there it is time you ate
this cannot be
you are not dead boy  accept it
this is monstrous  i will burn in hell for all eternity
what is to become of me  am i to wander the earth forever like a ghost
you will live  survive
then they were right  i am evil this is god's punishment
you have done nothing wrong conor macleod
why does he want to kill me
harder  concentrate harder
me arm hurts
harder  you swing like an impotent cow
go to hell
impotent cow
it will take less effort as you learn
you have a gift  one you must protect
and what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt
the fabric of life  the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another
you are no match for scot mr romirez  we are raised as riders
what is the fascinatioon  it is only a leaf
of course
you are young inexperienced  you do not know what time can do  how it can sap all pity all love
that is not me
go ahead senor  i have my friend to keep me company
i am your future husband remember
i have no future husband
my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands
what are you saying  i am standing here as real as you
you cannot be real conor  you had the last rites  no man has been cut half as bad and lived
but i did live
live  in less than a week you are prancing about the country like a squirrel
so why the crazy talk  it is a miracle it is  saint andrew has smiled on me  on us
there's rumor in the village some call it magic
that is mad  surely you do not take their word
i do not know conor  it is not natural  maybe something has touched you
you are sounding like that mad woman widow baggins
please not be touching me conor
i will not take that kind of talk from you  from those others below maybe  but not from you
leave me alone conor  please
if you send me away now mara i will not come looking for you
oh please  another one
what would you like
something pretty
that is wonderful  where did you ever learn it
far away
who am i deceiving
not so scared
perhaps not  you seem to have misplaced a private  no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck
romirez understood  not you
finish your prayers
complete your inspection
they are nothing but boys  it will be a slaughter tomorrow
i doubt much can change that the enemy has five brigades waiting for us
we need more time
eat up dupont  it will probably be your last
i thought i gave orders the regiment was to drill
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break fast cooking
what is your position
second musketeer
i understand you joined up in bremen
you seem to understand a great deal
i am a major private  you would do well remembering that when addressing me
wait  i think we understand each other
we have no understanding
help  i have seen others help somehow a head always ended up on the counter
it can be different  it must be
we must talk
stay out of it
do not turn your back on me
you are really going to force this are not you
you see major  you are not so different
ah conor how you look a man
your grandfather wore that in his service to the king and i to fight for the duke
must he go
aye  it is his duty  all of ours
but ian he is still but a boy
where did you learn that
my father taught me
your father must be smart
i want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff
we ran down that church hill info she is right  there is no richard taupin
any other ids come up
round up who you can and put them on standby
think we should call the local pd out there first
i do not know
smith  carl smith
how many came
the last four
and the bulgarian
he got him  he always does  eventually
he knows i am here  how
how are you
head still secure to the neck
how did you find me
what are you doing here
and have you something to settle with me
not tonight  tonight i have a drink with an old friend
he found us even there
i have not drunk this much since
i love zoos  ever since i was a kid
i knew his greatgrandfather
you are insane
no seriously  we used to shoot pool together in rangoon
the pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth
you are wrong
long time
you have been here from the start
friend of yours
of sorts
you disappoint me  i thought you would finally gotten over that sort of thing
leave her out of this
that is the point
this is not done  get up
that is the point  you have me finish it
it is all we have
perhaps miss cartwright would like to play
leave her alone
we have some unfinished business
are you here
i want you to come to me
and if i refuse
yes laddie i have her
mr  taupin what were you doing in that alley
i was walking by when i heard a shout  your men came right after
his name was iman fasil if that jogs your memory
it does not
do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh borhood at night
what were _you_ looking for
that is none of your business
do you know what this is
i presume it is a sword
a claymore to be exact  you would not know anything about it would you
your murder weapon
it was covered with mr fasil's fingerprints but none of his blood
a mystery
my condolences
a neighbor saw your car leave
do you
all i need is time
ah steven it is good to see you
i only just heard of conor  i came up from catroch as soon as i could
you are a kind man to be sure
i thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family
steven conor did not die
when your father died i saw to it that the grounds were kept up
the money in the estate was enough to cover your costs
you are one of william's kids huh
his only kid
sure take after him  never seen a father and son look more alike
we were very close
the resemblance is amazing
when may i expect the cleaners
nothing to be sorry about

i cannot imagine who did it i cannot think of any enemies i have
oh no how could you ever think of such a thing
did you finish the interview
no  but i am sure it will be all right with walter
but gee hildy  he gave us that insurance business  and you promised

well albany's a mighty good insurance town most people there take it out pretty early in life
anything the matter
how long would the interview take
oh  an hour for the interview another hour to write it
i never knew hildy to be so determined before
i do not know this makes me feel funny
why should not i make hildy my beneficiary i have got nobody else to leave it to
well of course if you put it that way
and remember this bruce i love her too
well bruce here you are  certified and everything
well she will know some day
do not want to forget this you know might start to rain again

that is this
does it you forget the power that always watches over the morning post
duffy get liebowitz
all the lawyers in the world are not going to help you

save that for the tribune
hello hildy
how long is what
maybe it was yesterday been seeing me in your dreams
no  mama does not dream about you any more walter you would not know the old girl now
you are repeating yourself that is the speech you made the night you proposed   any time  any place  anywhere
i notice you still remember it
i will always remember it if i had not remembered it i would not have divorced you
you know hildy i sort of wish you had not done it
sure come on we will have some lunch and you can tell me everything
i have a lunch date i just want 
you can break it cannot you
no i cannot
what do you mean by that
just what i said that is what i 
you mean you are not coming back to work here
that is the first time you have been right today that is what i 
you have had a better offer eh
you bet i have got a better offer
well go on and take it work for somebody else that is the gratitude i get for 
well have not you got anybody else
you have got to help me hildy

it will bring us together again hildy  just the way we used to be
listen you bumbleheaded baboon 
all right  thirtyfive and not a cent more
please will you just 
great grief that is that other paper going to give you
get married all you want to hildy but you cannot quit the newspaper business
you cannot sell me that walter
who says i cannot you are a newspaper man
that is why i am quitting i want to go some place where i can be a woman
bermuda rich eh
not what you would call rich makes about five thousand a year
that is his line
he is in the insurance business
the insurance business
it is a good honest business is not it
say sounds more like a guy i ought to marry that is his name
well i will give you a hint by tomorrow they will be calling me mrs bruce baldwin
too bad i could not see this guy first i am pretty particular about whom my wife marries
well he is waiting in the anteroom for me now
say could i meet him
oh better not walter would not do any good
you are not afraid are you
afraid i should say not
then what does he want with you
now you got me
you would not believe this walter but bruce holds the door open for me
and he takes his hat off when he is with a lady
what for
and when he walks with a lady he waits for her
here's luck to the bride and bridegroom
you said it
if he is nuts why does not the state just put him away
because it happened to be a colored policeman
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town
what a performance bravo do not let him fool you bruce  it is only an act
what do you mean only an act have not you got any feeling
well it is either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeney's
all right hildy i am licked but i will make you and bruce a business proposition
what do you think i am  a crook
yes  and that is putting it mildly no certified check  no story  get me
exclusive that is great
it cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley
never mind that that is the story
wait a minute your mother's alive
i meant on my grandmother's grave do not be so technical hildy that is the story
walter ddid you see    that

she jumped out of the window
whoa  wait a minute we cannot leave williams here one of the other fellows will 
we are going to take him over to my private office  where is our phone

you cannot take that desk out it is crawling with cops outside
get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load will you snap into it
how much do you want on it
all the words you have got
can i call the mayor a bird of prey  or is that libelous
for pete's sake hildy they are waiting for the rest of that story
well keep going we want an extra out on the streets before it is too late
where is bruce

how was that for a tight squeeze
do not tell me you were worried
in a way
i mean  working together just like the old days the things we have been through hildy
we have certainly been in some swell jams
remember the time we broke into the da's office and copied fifi randell's diary
we sure did but we had to go in hiding for a week
in the shoreland hotel and our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach
sorry hildy i did not mean to be making love to another mangs fiancee
yeah i suppose i could but walter 
he is going to have you the rest of his life hildy cannot you give me another hour
i do not know what to do walter
flip a coin

niagara falls walter you do not mean that

well i would like to be ladylike and think it over
that is what he said the last time do not believe him judge
hildy from this time on no tricks no doublecrossing  everything on the level
how about bruce's
but hildy  i can explain

that is not necessarily a bad thing
i hope you do not perform any of those dreadful torture experiments nathan
heavens no my work now is right now i am teaching mice well table manners to be candid

ummmm oh nathan this salad is delish

oh you know what we do or do not need to know since when have you become a media expert
i was young i was young confused we did not handle it the right way
what does this have to do with my testimony

and so i moved out i see the girls a couple of days a week
where you staying now
jeff wigand michael moore
you heard mr sandefur say before congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive
and that is what cigarettes are for
a delivery device for nicotine
a delivery device for nicotine put it in your mouth light it up and you are gonna get your fix
in other words you were charging sandefur and brown & williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously
most certainly
and on march 24 thomas sandefur ceo of brown & williamson had you fired and the reason he gave you
poor communication skills
i would bet on it
object to the form of the question
it acts as a drug on the body
object to the form
you threatening my family now too
now do not be paranoid jeff  about the direction of research here we may have had our differences of opinion
research  you declare as a badge of honor you do not even know what makes water boil
we cannot do the impossible mr andrews
what i am asking is not impossible my daughter is somewhere between here and miami i want her found
i have put extra men on all along the way
yes sir
how is she
whyuhshe is all right sir
that is the matter anything wrong
oh no sir no different than
you need not see anybody you can come directly to my study i would appreciate it very much if
i sold some drawers and socks too i am throwing those in
and this is what you wantthirty nine dollars and sixty cents
why not i am not charging you for the time i wasted
yes i knowbut
that is the matter is not it cheap enough a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars
let me get this straight you want this thirtynine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars
what ten thousand
the reward
who said anything about a reward
you are a peculiar chap
we will go into that some other time
you were taken for a buggy ride
here you are  do you mind if i ask you something frankly  do you love my daughter
a guy that would fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined
if you had half the brains you are supposed to have you would have done it yourselflong ago
i asked you a question do you love her
know what my next move is no more cigarettes
why do not you put me in chains
because marrying that fool king westley is
you are wasting your time i am already married to him

you cannot tempt me  do you hear i will not eat
where are you taking me
south america
south america
in that event we will not need so many supplies
what do you expect to accomplish by all this i am already married
i will get it annulled

you only met him once 
that was enough do you mind handing me the ketchup
you talk as if he were a gigoloor something
never mindi will get it myself  gigolo why you took the word right out of my mouth thanks
he is one of the best fliers in the country right now he is planning a trip to japan

so you saw oswald how many times
there were no phone records
all this blubbering over that sonofabitch  they are grieving like they knew the man  it makes me want to puke

the fact is he is gone chief and so's our case
you know you keep saying that
keep saying what
clay bertrand  sure i know him  he comes around the quarter
that is the other name
shaw  clay shaw
clay bertrand is clay shaw  the guy who used to run the international trade mart
yeah that is the big mystery everybody down here knows the guy
so why does he call himself bertrand
did he pay you for this
and that is where you met oswald for the first time
go on willie
hold your horses  what kinda source
morning boys  ready for a walking tour
at 730 sunday morning  it is not exactly fresh blood we are sniffing here boss
can you get some sworn statements
that is gonna be tough  nobody's talking
all right all right  break it up
where you going boss
that is it look like nick
nick what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of proloid
he would die pretty quick either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain
well i wanted to make sure she is the same girl i sent
i see and why are you experiencing this paranoia
no i did not
ever called dean andrews
no i did not
and have you ever met david ferrie
no i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures i have been shown
did you ever use the alias clay bertrand
no i did not
calm down dave what
i am a dead man  from here on believe me i am a dead man
what are you talking about dave you were not mentioned in the story do not jump to conclusions
you think your investigationgs been all that secret  you know when you talk to people they talk to other people
what did they
you still questioning any cubans
dave you know that is where this road leads
the fontainbleau  20 minutes
yeah  come on dave come on our side  i guarantee you the boss will protect you  dave
give me protection
yeah  he would kill for you dave  he likes you  your mind
did we involve you dave or did clay shaw
that cocksucking faggot  he is got me by the balls
come in dave  have a seat make yourself comfortable  coffee
that is not true  i never met anybody named oswald  anybody who told you that has to be crazy
but you are aware he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager
no if he did i do not remember him  there were lots of kids in and out y'know
i am sure you have seen this  perhaps you knew this man under another name
yeah now that is true  i drove to houston
oh it was just a spur of the moment thing  the storm was not that bad
i see  and where did you drive
we went straight to houston and then saturday night we drove to galveston and stayed over there
why galveston
no particular reason  just to go somewhere
did you bag any geese on this trip
i believe the boys got a couple
why  that is wrong
leongs in a bad mood do not get excited he is all right
who was paying you dave
you think i was a getaway pilot for the assassination do not you
was it the same oswald dave that was in dallas or was it an impersonator
and shaw
shaw's an untouchable man  highest clearance  shaw oswald the cubans  all agency
get some rest dave and you will feel better in the morning  we will talk then
colonel finck are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck
i was told that the family wanted examination of the head
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death was it not
but you took his orders  he was directing the autopsy
no because there were others  there were admirals
i call'em as i see'em jim  i am ruling it inadmissible
that is our case
if that is your case you did not have a case  i would not believe whatever habighorst said anyway
i cannot believe you are saying this in the courtroom
dad look what i drew
that is something jasper  what is it
daddy  where have you been
are we going away daddy
well it looks like it jasper
because of kennedy  are the same people gonna kill us daddy
he asked me why i thought i was in danger and i said
well if they can kill the president they can certainly get me
that does not make sense mrs hill we have the man that killed the president
look do you want the truth or just what you want me to say
i want the truth
the truth is that i heard between four and six shots  i am not going to lie for you
you heard echoes
no  i had guns all my life  i used to go turtle shooting
how many shots you say you heard
spas t raikin a leading member of an anticommunist group
sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washingtongs cabinet
i do not believe it
are not you being a little hard
i am sorry
i am not sure i understand
well in an investigation we are conducting your name has come up a number of times
i would not imagine where
we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you  are you acquainted with a david logan
no  never heard of him
a willie o'keefe
let me show you his picture 
no  i am sure i have never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance
no it was not  do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews
mr shaw can you identify this man
naturally  are you claiming mr garrison that mr oswald also had dinner with me
mr shaw did you ever meet lee harvey oswald
you really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters do not you mr garrison
and if i was mr garrison do you think i would be here today talking to somebody like you
no people like you do not have to i guess  people like you walk between the raindrops
but you did not seem nearly so sure in your statement to the warren commission
mrs mercer as a former fbi man it is difficult to accept this
honey go back to sleep please
jim come on honey get down on your hands and knees and hunt for jasper's easter egg
look at the calendar for christ's sake  you said a sunday not easter sunday
tough day
my sympathies
liz i am really sorry  the meeting went much longer than expected
we waited for you hours jim you could have telephoned for god's sake  it is easter  you promised jim
that sounds dandy but it does not replace a father and a husband on easter day
did they live
it is not funny jim i am scared
nothing is going to happen to you i will not let it
honey some crackpot  martin luther king was killed in memphis today
your daughter's life was just threatened
just a crank making phone calls happens a dozen times a day at the office
our home jim  a kidnapper a murderer who knows
get a hold of yourself
i promise i will make more time for jasper
and if you are wrong
i never doubted for a second that i was  will you come to the trial elizabeth
he won and they killed robert kennedy  they shot him down
for sexual purposes
willie are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal  under the supervision of a doctor
fuck yeah  i told you so  and you can tell'em all i told you so
that is wrong lou
oh no how bad
one little guy with a cheap rifle  look what he can do
remember whose office this was back in '63  531 lafayette street
i would say he was probably getting intelligence training
lou you were in the marines  who would be running that training
the office of naval intelligence
i cannot say that comes as a surprise anymore
take a good look chief do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember
we need to find more witnesses lou
can we find her
the zapruder film is the proof they did not count on lou  we gotta get our hands on it
when kennedy gets to the kill zone it is a turkey shoot
the warren commission call him
his boss was the one on the warren commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community
chief i have had my doubts about bill for a long time  he is fighting everything
welcome district attorney garrison may i call you jim
some people would say you are paranoid
well if i am why is the government concealing evidence
pictures like this do not show up on television
sure they do  the camera can pick this up
i am glad you came  i am sorry about the precautions
i could give you a false name but i will not  just call me x
some story the whole thing it is like it never happened
here's my problem jack  you told me you and guy were good friends for a long time
more than ten years
and he never hit you before
how much more
i do not know if i should talk about this
well i would ask guy  we were friendly you know  heart attack was not it
if you buy what you read in the paper
you have other information
i did not say that  all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out
dave ferrie  you know about him
like i said a fucking nuthouse
clay something that was his name  clay
bertrand  clay bertrand
yeah  that is it  i do not know  maybe it was not  i gotta go
clay bertrand  he is in the warren report  he tried to get oswald a lawyer  was kennedy ever discussed jack
sure  'course they hated the sonofabitch but
nobody knows what we are talking about jack
hold it chief
no she could get hurt  if you believe that is happening to these other people
she is the best damn witness we have
welcome mr miller  jim garrison would you care for some coffee
they have been enlarged and show a lot of detail
i know about that shot  a terrible tragedy  how much do you have for carrying on your investigation
if you must know virtually nothing
how many men are working with you on this
less than you would guess  most days two to three assistant da's a handful of police investigators
that is all you have had all this time
that sounds fun
do you walk home
when are you going back to washington sir
no that could not be done mr ruby there are a good many things involved in that
can i help you
i am sorry i just decided to stay in the suit  get out of that damn uniform

why were you with him
i went to give him his refund so he would not have to come here

she leaves somebody will be on her
are you really a bail bondsman
i gave you my card there
can i see your id
who put up my bond ordell
can we stop for cigarettes
sure ever been to the riverbottom
i do not think so
it is okay it is a cop hangout
could not we just stop at a seven eleven
i thought you might want a drink
i would love one but not there
we could stop at the hilton by the airport
is it dark
it is kind of a sports bar
that does not sound dark
you gain weight
you are not tired of it
that would be beaumont livingston
that is him how do you know 'em
i wrote him on monday they found him dead on tuesday
ordell pick up his bond
same as you ten thousand
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont
you mentioned a guy from lapd but you did not mention the federal
i did not
no you did not what branch
he is the one who wants you
how many trips did you make
with ten thousand nine
ask atf they might give you permission
yeah if i cooperate
what wouldya think
if you are having some
you get a chance to use it
i felt a lot safer having it my milk went bad when i was in jail
thanks but i have my own now
what i could not hear you
i could not wait till i got home last night and wash my hair
who is this
'74 i think
i called in sick this morning as far as the airline knows i am still available
what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you
i want to talk to them first i know more now about ordell's money
how would you find that out
he told me last night
he called you
he came by
what what would you do
he needs me without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in cabo sugar
how do you get it out
same way i been doing but first they got to let me go back to work
you are gonna offer to set him up
if i get let off otherwise fuck 'em
it is very possible ordell's killed somebody
how do you feel about getting old
you are not old you look great
i am asking how you feel does it bother you
it is different with men
does something else worry you
i just feel like i am always starting over you said how many bonds you wrote
i walked right past you
i know ignoring me what are you up to
catching a movie
what would ya see
american president
how was it
pretty good me and annette bening are goin steady
and annette's it for you
who was your girl before annette
sandra bullock you know her
yeah she is the girl who drove the bus in speed she is cute
i am old enough to be her father
how old's annette
what are you a bag lady
i go back to work tomorrow
you talk them into it
they seem to like the idea
make the delivery somewhere in the mall
right around here in the food court
will ordell go for that
i am helping him bring his money into america he loves the idea you just missed him
he was here
yeah we were going over everything that is why all the bags
you think he is got a thing for you
he is setting me up to make a proposition
i see
you do not propose something like that unless you are pretty sure the other persongs into it
you know some interesting people
he were not bullshitting either 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire
what about you max
what if i was in nicolet's place
no i mean you right now not it you were somebody else
a halfamillion dollars will always be missed
you are avoiding the question
a lot of reasons but the main one would be i am tired of it
when did you decide
hi i am max cherry your bail bondsman
got another gun and a stun gun
and went to this guy's house in el monte and i waited for him
what do you do when he comes home
shoot him with the stun gun while he is incapacitated cuff him take 'em to county
you do that
that is my job
and is that it
i am not sure you answered my question
which one
if you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a halfmillion dollars would you take it
do not even think about it you could get yourself killed go to prison
the feds it is evidence
i told them ordell's changed the amount he is bringing in
do you think they bought it
oh yeah i got them thinking ordell's real nervous they love thinking he is scared of them
you know a good cop will not let you know he knows you are fulla shit
it will be more than that
do not be so literal ray believed it
but you still have to show him the money at the airport
well you know i am not going to show him the whole amount he will see fifty thousand
where is the rest of it
in the bag underneath
then you are out and you get nothing
yeah but i am not in jail and i tried
you are gonna have surveillance all over you
that is why you do not make a move till i come out of the fitting room
in a dress
how would you find out
all winston had to do was ask around ordell's living in long beach with a woman junkie
so how do we give ordell to nicolet
get ordell to come to your office
tell him you want to see him
i have chickened out i am afraid of him he will like that
what do you tell nicolet
he is already there
what if he hears something he is not supposed to
i got your package it was fun getting a halfamillion dollars in the mail
less ten percent
only this is not a bail bond max
i hesitated taking that much
you worked for it  if you are sure that is all you want
i saw ray the other day boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement
did you tell him you were leaving
i did not use you max
i did not say you did
i never lied to you
i know
we are partners
i am fiftyfiveyears old i cannot blame anybody for anything i do
i would feel a whole lot better if you took some more money
madrid or barcelona
wanna go
thanks but you have a good time
sure i cannot twist your arm
thank you for saying that but no my business
i thought you were tired of your business
i am just tired in general
who's side are you on
i beg your pardon
what if i plead guilty
and cooperate you might get probation
he say we like the same thing as married
most of the times
sometimes every day for a while
you know that is in the bag you are taking
he say is a surprise
and what would this be sweet and low
what the fuck is that shit
i know what it looks like
look that shit ai not mine
we will just be a minute
thanks for waiting jackie now tell me what can we do for you
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job

ordell has a white guy working for him named louis
you talk to him
not really
his full name is louis gara he just got out from serving four years in susanville

was she there
she did not say
well this sounds like a lady i would like to have a word with so everything's set for tomorrow
we could if i am not in jail
that is fifty thousand huh it does not look like that much
i was told ten thousand in each pack
you did not count it
ever been tempted
yes all those things are true
after all it do not belong to nobody right
i thought i did
you took the time to pay the saleswoman
i had to i was frantic i did not know what to do
there was a guy with melanie
it is possible you are saying you do not have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand
i have no idea
you would take a polygraph on it

he says on the photo he will call tomorrow at eleven  why not come back then and listen for yourself
what do you mean no
he says it is a game  all games have a strategy
are you crazy
we did not ask for your opinion doctor
you do not tell us how to run our investigation  you got that
i would not know
that is right  i guess only the killer would know that
how would you get in here
the door was open
no it was not
of course it was  otherwise i would be breaking and entering  that is a felony
what do you want
you got it on the board
no i need the original note
he is not talking about himself
we are interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there
you sure you were not over on pine road
i am positive
you are a lying bastard
yes you are
the message  i figured out
you want me to what
i want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer
sorry to ruin your trip to the city but we got a real nut on our hands frank
what do you think
he is got an answer for everything but he does not have an alibi
you think he is dirty
we would not want someone's death to interfere with your games
take it easy  both of you
no shit
the fbi has nothing remotely similar to this guy  i think he is a first timer
we have checked  there's no one with the last name of emma on the island
how is she
she is unconscious but they think she is going to make it
you alright
i have seen a lot of things in my time on the job but nothing like this yurilivich
what is it
why does he call sanderson
sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing  but who called him today
a few people
did anyone stand out
what do you mean stand out
did anyone look suspicious  think
now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious
it does not make sense because we do not understand it
do not fuck with us  where did you go
we will find the evidence
hello peter
who is this
someone who's going to become an important part of your life  i want to play a game with you
hello peter
yes  why did you kill debi rutlege
to get your attention
did you know her
and  what path is that
we all have paths to follow  you hope yours will lead you to me
why not
i did another one last night  you might have saved her but you did not want to play
where is she
you will find her
i suppose you want to know where i am going to kill tonight peter
you know her
not really
why her
because she is the type
but you said you did not know her
i know what i said  she looks just like
just like who
i really wish you would stop trying to maneuver me  i find it irritating not to mention insulting
i am just trying to play the game
i am sure there are other people who would be interested in what i have to say
just for that no hint today
why are you doing this  you must have some idea of the pain you are causing people
and you want these girls to feel your pain
huxley's quote also says his play is always fair and just
have you any idea what the message is
if it is so important why do not you just tell me
i could not tell you that  it would ruin the game  not that you are playing it very well
you heard me  why did you go out to the institute looking for her
what makes you think i was there
i could not tell you that  it would ruin the game
last night was very exciting was not it  have you figured out what i am doing
you are playing the tarakoss opening
very good
you are next move should have been e2 e3
i used a variation  you should have anticipated that  have you figured out the message
what word did you leave last night
the police have not told you
hello peter
you sonofabitch
emotional  i expected more from you
if you kill tonight and i am in jail the police will know i am innocent
by that time the game will be over
congratulations on your daring escape you just missed me by a few seconds  it is check peter
please wait
the game's over  you lost
that would not be very sporting remember huxley  his play is always fair and just
you are groping  i have been fair it is my move now
i will give you anything you want anything  please
i know where you are
very good  how did you know
how would you know i would not be in the same room with her
this is not going to help david you are mother's dead  you cannot undo it
you do not understand
that is this
oh i put a few games on for your daughter  i hope you do not mind
sure  we have got a modem line hooked up with the data base in new york
can we correlate data  look for specific things like player's ages stuff like that
nope  nothing
now what
there's three  the first is 1983 lionel baines  the boston
never mind  he died two years ago
1985  hans korshaud
what is it
what scars
would you mind keeping your voice down i have guests
the police came to me for help  what could i do
you could have been honest with me for starters  we work together  i have to be able to trust you
i admit i handled it badly  sanderson was not going to talk to me but you are young attractive
the same type as the girl who got killed  jesus alan the guy could be a psychopath
they asked who would be best suited for this and you
it worked out alright did not it
feeling better
i just cannot believe it
kathy please  you are going to wear a hole in the carpet
i am just nervous  sorry
you are safe  he would not come here
why did he
why did he what
come here
you must be erica
uh huh
is your dad here
so are you having a good time on the island
not really  it is pretty boring
do you like my dad
i know he really likes you
how do you know that  did he say something
okay  nice meeting you
congratulations dad
what are you doing up
i cannot sleep  my beds lumpy
i see  you forgot to bring you are nightlight did not you
that has nothing to do with it
has he gotten through to any
do not you have something you want to say to david
you ready
for what
you told me you would take me over to seattle today
i am sorry honey i cannot  not today
it is not kathy
whaddaya got nolan
not much  there's no sign of a break in  i think she let him in
how long has she been dead
six eight hours tops
any sign of rape
what about prints
no prints
you mean no prints but hers
there's only two hardware stores on the whole island  we will check that out what about the blood
that is great
how long she been dead
i would say at least eighteen hours
well what  i told you this was a stupid idea  you cannot learn anything from someone in a few minutes
you did not pick up any vibes from the guy
i am a psychologist frank not a psychic  that is this all about anyway
we are not sure
what do you think he did
i am busy right now
i see you are still having problems with your openings
and this jeremy
no  i told him to  i wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end
but we heard him
anything else
his home would be mount olympus
before we go in i gotta tell you this is not going to be pretty
i know that  i have seen the photo's
you never know how you are going to catch a suspect
each of those grids represents almost a square mile
as large as castles
what time did he get there
he is right kathy
we cannot rely on your judgement anymore
the most logical choice
did you see his face
no  he was wearing a mask but i saw the cut on his wrist  it was peter
i cannot arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist  do you have someone you can stay with tonight
i have got a room at the institute i use when i stay late
excuse me you said earlier that mary albert just moved in  how long ago was that
ten days ago
do you know how she found the apartment
through a rental agency
i know you are busy so i will get right to it  did you know her
could you tell me where you were last night
why did not you tell us you were there earlier
mister sanderson this is doctor sheppard  she is a psychologist helping us out
you want me to go with you  maybe i can help
what have you come up with on the riddle
wee willie winkie runs though the street  we think he might be making a reference to himself
maybe but i do not think so  i think it is just a tease
another one  what word did he leave
as large as castles  you are still light as air one hundred men cannot move me
he is using the map as a chessboard the sonofabitch is playing chess with me
how can he be playing chess with you you are not making any moves against him
it is a commercial area  no one lives there
a building
he is not going to give us direct hints he is going to skirt around it
wait a minute  there's an apartment in that area called the castle arms
where were you last night
are we going to go through this again
answer the question
jeremy would have never killed himself
do not you understand what i am telling you  that is why he wants me out of the way
alright c'mon peter  we are moving you to a cell
did you send the car
you opened with the english  lutz will not use it  he opened his first game with it
he knows you are aware of that
then i will transpose
on a variation yes  but it must be a variation that is unique
it is a good play but risky
we got a problem
our computer went on the fritz again david came up to fix it
you are always in the middle of a match
you have something you want to say
just thought you might want to talk
about what
whatever's on your mind
what do you see here
mate in five
feel like practicing
i can check and call you back
thank you  i am at 6397393
bainbridge books
sara this is doctor sheppard  i called you earlier about a book
of course  yes here it is  why they are all the same
what are they please
sorry  i thought it was empty
i love this hotel  i stay here every time i visit my parents
how come you do not stay with them
because i love them but they drive me crazy  you know how parents are
are you with the tournament
uh huh
when i was very young
sounds very violent
that is a very personal question
i see  this is going to be a very polite conversation  what shall we discuss  the weather  movies
are you disappointed that i will not answer you
i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess
it is
do you always open quickly
each circumstance requires a different tactic
well i think i have had enough
what are you looking for
nothing  i just came in for a steam
we need your help
i offered my help this morning and sedman turned me down
but you are the key  the one he wants to play the game with
i cannot right now  i have got a game
she could be dead after the game
you sure you do not want to eat something
you sound like my mother
it was not intentional
i think it is interesting
another kind of game
in a way
of course
do you
let's change the subject
you mean like in the steam room
that is not fair
you are not
how the hell can i relax after seeing what i just saw
i know it was bad
i know you did not
you know andy thinks you are doing this
can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it
no  but i am open to distractions
you know you are not the easiest person in the world to get close to
you always want to talk about me  what about you
was not i just talking about me
no  you were talking about chess
alright  what about me
i dunno  where is erica mother
she died in a car accident
i am sorry
it is alright  it was a long time ago
it must have been very hard on erica
it was
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games
i am not playing a game now
yes you are  you are playing word games
what is this
i am just trying to get to know you peter
what are you talking about  you do not even know me
i just do not want to fight with you
this frightens me  because i am starting to feel things i have not felt in a long time
you have got to face the things you feel
i thought you were the woman who did not want to get involved
i am hungry
would you settle for pepperoni
did you call
they are not delivering  i am going to go pick up the pizza
i thought you said the line was busy
i tried again and got through
for emphasis
exactly  it is the key
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine  violent
because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid
i am not looking for an apology peter
i was thinking that maybe when this is all over we could
i want someone i can get close to i do not know if that is possible with you
no listen  you have no idea of the kind of pressure i am under right now
you are wife died  you cannot feel responsible for that
you do not understand
then help me to understand  i want to understand
this letter  i have never opened it
why not
because i know what it says
it could be anything
how did you know it was carefully
frank told me
you are right  the killer told me
this is not going to be like the phone book is it
you are going to be late for your match
are you going to come tonight
you beat him
i got lucky
it is over now
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future
you are getting sloppy yurilivich you are nervous
i am not nervous
well you should be because this time i am going to win
i am sorry i could not help it
oh that  i know what you mean  i had nightmares all week
me too
last night was the worst i dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other and walked like a penguin
mine was worse i dreamt you picked your nose in public
that is worse
you are really not bad looking almost handsome
well you are beautiful
you umightu be handsome i cannot tell through all that grime besides you reek of sweat and horses
if you are going to marry a warrior you would best get used to it
we are almost married
we are not married uyetu
i do not trust you to wash behind your ears
i do not have to look around i have found the husband i want you can kiss me now
thank you but i can wait
i lied
about what
have they harmed you
lyssa where are they keeping you
where is the fortress
i do not know it is a maze of tunnels i cannot see out
i will find you i will be with you
i know it
i love you lyssa i love you 
you must move away from the center
will your power outward
i do not know how
take the western passage
move quickly we are coming for you we are in the fortress
in the arctic ice
you will both wait at least for five hours the wedding is at three
it was a platonic kiss father
they have lyssa
you will go alone
i will not leave you here
you will do as i tell you you will try to reach ynyr the old one
the white castle has fallen
does the queen live
the new queen lives
turold's son was to marry her
i have no extraordinary powers
your powers are greater than you know  have you ever seen one of these
two or three days while lyssa is in their hands
there is no other way
but it opens onto the sheer wall of the needle there's no way down
you have rope
i am too old to climb down a rope
there is nothing
reach out farther call to her
you have not slept in two days
you choose these
they know when they are going to die
i cannot reach her
what do you see
she cannot see out she cannot tell us where the fortress is
yes they knew of your first contact so they drove her below
i cannot reach her
i am not sure
but you suspect
no we will find another way to locate the fortress
he has come for lyssa
lyssa uwhyu
like you she has extraordinary powers he would make her his queen
can she be forced
you are young you do not understand the attraction of great power and you forget the pain of long waiting
traitor she will marry you in hell
i will melt that gold and pour it down your throat old man
from here i must go alone
he ran a great risk helping us today if he opposes his fate his death will be terribly painful
she must make a glaive
the spiral begins in the west
she is on the other side of this wall i can feel it
i chose the wrong passage
she can see the beast
use your sword
what use is my sword i cannot reach her
you must move quickly the beast will stop at nothing now
you are coming with us
it is my fate to die in the fortress
no you cannot know that
i can because i choose it
how did you know
do not let the waters touch you
they can be saddled
you have done it
it is today
each to his fate
i know the cruelty of such a fate
perhaps you think no man would return to me
you too are lonely
i ache with it
let me comfort you
i cannot take comfort when she has none
then give me comfort sleep with me tonight
i feel your pain but i cannot betray her
you will not then
help help i am drowning
i doubt it the water is only an inch deep
it could have been quicksand i might have been sucked to my death  where is this place
i just remembered i have urgent business in this direction
what business
once is enough thank you
i was hoping i might be your friend
my ufriendu
i have need of friends
not yet my friend it is your tomato that is dying
try your tricks on me and i will turn myself back into a snake and bite you
you and i will guard the fire
i do not think you will grow careless
fame is what you leave to your sons
how did you know i had sons
because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for
hah you do not know me boy
you will follow me
and in the few seconds before i dice you to crowfood tell me why i am going to follow you
and where do you lead boy
to the place where death lives
it should be an interesting journey then
that i promise you
when did you last sleep boy
they burn many villages even walled cities fall to them
i am not hungry
forgive me it is childish to cry
well i am not impressed
you have eaten nothing
we must try to get horses
yes it will double our range  i know at least a dozen ways to get horses all cheap
these we will pay for
lad you have an unnatural desire to pay for things it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination
hand over your dinner
forgive me my friends i saw terrible things
go join them
what kind of friend do you think i am
the best but my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it
well it is true that if i received a royal command i could not very well disobey it could i
go i command you
we could reach it on firemares
we must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise
i intend to keep you alive your majesty so you can abdicate your throne and become my warlord
make for the wall i will catch up
nothing worse than lowerclass boors with upperclass morals
would you settle for a boar
what is that awful looking place
the swamp of betrayal be glad we do not have to cross it
where are you going
we will meet you at the inn
a venison pie as big as a house
my heart stays here
what kind of a boy are you boys always have candy
i have a cinnamon bar
you do
i am ergo the magnificent    short in stature    tall in power    narrow of purpose    wide of vision
i am hungry
i would wish for a puppy
one puppy why not wish for a hundred
i only want one
sir ergo  my honorable lord ergo 
what now you poke me in the nose as well
we meant only to please you
oh she was so beautiful  and i was so uuglyu
would you desert your friends
but also very young six to one is no odds boy
put me down you lout
you had better manners as a pig
what are you doing with my dear stop thieves
many villagers are hiding in the forest they need food
and do you think i live on air
we have plenty of hares
food for crows
surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison
i am being exploited where are you going
oh my poor stew
look at its beauty look at its grace
my spells always go wrong when i am observed be gone
he did not join them they joined him
and who is uheu that they should join uhimu
they will trample him to death
i do not want your worlds or your slaves
it is a lie
these walls do not lie he will betray you
he will not
he will come for me

we can save half a day by crossing the stone lake
many have perished in that maze
the leader of the dark ones
i must go to the widow perhaps she will help
that creature helps no one and none who go there return
she has the power of vision
she has the power to kill
perhaps she will not kill me for i know her name
her name is death
few have survived it
we must reach the valley of reeds before the next dawn
i will stay behind and keep them busy
it is fifty years since i heard that name
it is fifty years since i spoke it to you

and when you came downstairs what happened
i saw brooke standing over his body drenched in his blood
but mrs windham did not have a gun
did you hear a shot fired
no i was in the shower
so at some point in the  twenty minutes you were in the shower your father was shot
but you did not hear the shot because you were in the shower
miss windham can you tell us what you would been doing earlier in the day
i got up went to starbucks went to the gym got a perm and came home
how many would you say
chutney why is it that tracy marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down
dewey newcomb
who's asking
all i know is  it is not brooke
did you get it
why the hell not
what are you talking about
good work today ms woods
sit down
is everything okay
you followed your intuition today and you were right on target i should have listened
thank you
i think it is time discuss your career path have you thought about where you might be a summer associate
you are hitting on me
you are a beautiful girl elle
so everything you just said 
you are not going up there
i do i am not allowing it
what did you see when you entered the house
i saw mrs windham standing over the body of mr windham
was she carrying a weapon
mr salvatore do you have any proof that you and mrs windham were having an affair
i am sorry
for what breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man
uh  both
would you be willing to stake your life on it
i think so
 his life
i do not know
what would you do
that is terrible
so that is this sarah got that you do not three tits
she is from connecticut she belongs to his stupid country club
is she
could i be anymore goddamn spastic  so you are sure this warner guy is the one
god that felt great
look at him he is still scratching his head
so this is the only interaction you two have ever had
no sometimes i say okay instead of fine
have you ever considered asking him if he would like a cold beverage or perhaps a neck massage
that is the point  look at me
good one
i am so happy for you
how would it go at the trial
great donovan actually said the words good work ms woods he takes me seriously can you believe it
i am here to see brooke windham
licensed attorney or family member
hi sarah knottingham
our group is full
i believe her too i do not think she is having an affair with enrique
too bad you and i are the only ones
it is not my alibi to tell 
i know i thought that was very  classy of you
warner cannot even do his own laundry
i know he has it sent out
did you know he got waitlisted when he applied his father had to make a call
i am a bitch
yes you are
and donovangs a scumbag for coming on to you
you are pawning the rock
can someone please tell rick that he is not the only sigma chi with a big penis
too demure
i think you should go with red it is the color of confidence
i do not know everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more   serious
we still love you sisters forever
once warner sees me as a serious law student he will want me back it is a completely brilliant plan
but is not it kind of hard to get into law school
here you are gonna need this
your scrunchie
it is elle  guess what i am doing right this second
power yoga
josh proposed
keep june first open  you are one of my bridesmaids and give warner our love
hello you are like a lawyer
do they just  put you on the spot like that like all the time
the professors yeah they tend to do that socratic method
you have stromwell
and make sure you read the footnotes in levinsongs class that is where all her exam questions come from
good luck
do not ask
okay if brooke did not kill the guy who did
explain to me why you are so anti brooke
uh for starters she will not give us an alibi 
aside from that
and d brooke is obviously hiding something
but maybe it is not what you think
you are kind of being a butthead right now
i cannot believe you called me a butthead no one's called me a butt head since ninth grade
damn we cannot see her for an hour
mrs windham vandermark
she is not
how can you still believe she is innocent
you are going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment she is lying
and you know this for a fact
i cannot
that is a direct result of anti blonde discrimination
in that case maybe heyworth got fellated by a brunette and brooke caught him
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixtyyearold man can take
what the hell is that for
the bags under your eyes you are an attractive man but you need to take better care of yourself
projecting joy is not my job
you really think i am attractive
back up how do you know he is gay
whoa  why
law school was a mistake getting this internship was a mistake
oh my god
up for a celebration dinner
are you asking me on a date
as long as you realize i am not just some mantoy you can show off like a trophy
then forget it besides i have an early class tomorrow
someone missed you
is he the only one
but i am not positive it is gonna happen tonight 
no  it is just  not me
i am canceling the mixer we will blacklist sigma chi
thank you serena but i do not think it will do any good
oh he is so over on this campus
how could this happen
i do not know i do not know anything any more  i just need to be by myself
girls  i am going to harvard
you guys  i cannot we are in the middle of a trial
i wish we could stay longer but i have a game
why not
yes ms woods
i did
you are applying for my internship are not you
i do not know 
you should do you have a resume
it is pink
amazing how
she could make you drop three pounds in one class she is completely gifted
his twentyseven year old daughter and the pool boy
maybe she found him like that
you do not really believe she is innocent
class schedule map book list
has warner huntington checked in yet
wait  my social events schedule is missing
your what
you know  mixers formals beach trips
there's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes does that count
you are beautiful
i completely agree
i am sorry elle i just 
you are breaking up with me  i thought you were proposing
proposing elle if i am going to be a politician i need to marry a jackie not a  marilyn
you are breaking up with me because i am too  blonde
that is not entirely 
then what my boobs are too big
elle believe me i never expected to be doing this but i think it is the right thing to do
how can it be the right thing if we are not together
i have to think about my future and what people expect from me
so you are breaking up with me because you are afraid your family will not like me  everybody likes me
i told you elle i need someone  serious
what are you talking about you are not here to see me
no silly i go here
you go where
harvard law school
you got into harvard law
oops time for class meet me after on the benches
good good
i am sorry i just hallucinated
wow you are a walking felony
thank you having fun
now i am
i feel like we have barely spent any time together since we got here
that is because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos
i did not mean 
am i on glue or did i not get into the same law school you did warner
well yeah but 
but what we took the same lsat we take the same classes 
you look  nice
if you tell him you will probably make summer associate who cares about brooke think about yourself
thanks for the backup
in court on opposing sides
are you serious
a restaurant in oakland where no one would recognize us
and how long have you been sleeping with mrs windham
three months
she is naked
i' m sure that was very awkward for chutney  much as it is for me hearing you tell about it
but i guess it was not enough for brooke
why do you say that
is it a kappa
oh god what if josh does not think i am serious enough
helloo you let him have anal sex with you  helloo you let him videotape you diddling yourself
let's all go road trip
you passed spanish because you gave professor montoya a handjob after the final

josh said
i was wondering
you are driving me crazy  do you know what it is like trying to jackoff in an armoire
not really
you are off you know  you are way way off
i thought i was helping you
it would help me if i could kiss you
okay but then we will just be friends okay
on the handlebars or your shoulders
you hate your father
if he tricked me into loving him is what i meant
you would hate him for the trick
i do not wanna go
he asked where you were  he wants you with him
where are you
you are so nice to let sam use your shower
why is that
just i mean well you are here every single day
he is at work while i am here
i guess i would just be jealous if i were him
well he does not need to worry
if my kids and my wife were always at an exhusband's house i would worry
he will not leave my room
and of course the beck's with the
it could have been a squirt gun
are you guys' friends
we have known each other since grade school

i took some of your vicodin
i know  why
i know the feeling
how do you become something you are not

i know parts of who you are
i wish you had told me then
i am telling you now

getting high i guess
if i asked you to stop would you
i have not used anything for two days i am trying
i am proud of you sam
sun glasses
to hide a black eye
why would not she leave
i think she was terrified of living with himbut maybe even more terrified of life without him
i loved him too much
after everything he did to you and your mom
after everything
you look better than ever
i do not think mom cares that much that mythat peter left
she seemed upset
are you taking them still
i do not know what that means  what kind of problem
the kind where there is not really an answer
i do not know what that means  what kind of problem
the kind where there is not really an answer
we are all dying from the start  i just got picked for advanced placement
you lied to me
i would have lied to me if i thought i would believe it
this was all for your sake was not it having me here  trying to get me to like you
i never tried to get you to like me  i tried to get you to love me
i would eat a lot of red meat
what would you do
what kind of house
can you build a house in four months
good for you
was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty
thanks for telling me
ah  oh
i am surprised he has not left
it is my day off  i thought i would help with the plumbing
i need you to do me a favor
god you look like crap george
why do you let your dog crap on his lawn day after day
i just wanted to know where mom was
oh  sorry
it is okay
she needs to be alone i think
because dad left
she is a little sad is all
you should lock your doors
did sam call to tell you he would not be over this weekend
lock the door behind you
where is he
what are you doing
he never answers
i called everyone everywhere  you just vanished  you could be dead
thanks for waking me up  picking me up you are loud today
you are inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion
a blueprint spool
where have you been for a week
four days  i left to think
what did you do with your dog
kurt's been feeding him
but you cannot call me while you think
i need to talk to you
why would they tow your truck
i was parked in day parking
why call me
i am going to tear down the shack and build my house
you have been saying that for twenty years while we were dating you said it
i love those doors
where will you live
whengs school over
fridaygod i hate the thought of him home all day
i will be by saturday to pick him up
he does not want to spend the weekends with you anymore
you and sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer
the garage is plumbed  i will put in a toilet  we will survive
thank you for at least sounding sincere
sounding  i need help  he is cheap labor
one of you would end up dead
at least we will have a house to show for it
forget it really  i will survive
i want him with me
hey hey
i do not have a phone
i drove over and you were gone
i cannot leave the house
last time you were gone for a week
did you tell him he was spending the summer with me
no  i was going to let you do that
i did say he could go
we are fine  turkey sandwiches
i used to live here
but you hated four out of the five you did
i do not even like turkey sandwiches what kind of pizza
you head was pressed against my chest  i could feel your heart racing  and i remember i kissed your hair
what is it
it is not breakfast yet
i dreamed about your house last night
finished or unfinished
it was perfect george  amazing  it was so real
did not you once dream you could lick people well though
that was not a dream  that was sam
ohwith his ear infection
go in there and lick his attitude
i have been wrong a lot in my life
with your hands or your tongue
i thought you would be up with the sun
do you need anything  i will go to the pharmacy  i have some demerol at home
where is sam
i will find something that will not kill them
or wound  let them keep their eyes and fingers
do you need help
it is been a while
tell him how you made me fall in love with you
i smiled at him
let's see if you have gotten any better
maybe you should not come everyday
no  why  i like to be with sam
i know they are not much help but they love coming here george
i thought we were helping
nothing is going on with us is it
going on
when i picked you up from the train stationwhat you said
what did i say
that thing about i was the most you know beautiful person you had ever known  what was that
that was the truth
you have never said that before
i will say a lot of things i have never said before  it is habit
it sounded like a pickup line
i am married
you bit my finger
let's not do this okay
i need to know
is your back still killing you
no  mostly me
peter left me yesterday
left you
no goodbye  no fuck you  no 'are you in love with george'

his father is a man
we have eaten
is lois still here  i am starved
do you think it is odd your kids do not hug you

to shave your chest
the biggest waste of time since television
i would love to drive through new england in the fall
after the kids are back in school
i cannot go right now
you cannot go because of sam
we have not been away together for three years  what difference does a few months make
i was talking about our marriage

you live a fabulous life robin
despite you
i never asked for more
that is the problem

i hardly recognize you with a beard
that was my planto be hardly recognizable to you as me

when did mexican customs start getting smart
creasy where the fuck are you
i am here
you got a secondary search and you had a gun
listen it was a calculated risk i have done it a million times and never got caught
everything happens once if you live long enough
it does not make sense to xray your bags coming off the plane
so that is wrong
nothing wrong
but do not you stay in el paso
yeah right
oh like you have not been in worse places
you been working
not for eight months i was in columbia looking around but nothing seemed interesting
how long you staying crease
you did something on impulse
your spanish is good enough you certainly look the part
you are crazy people would hire a hasbeen ray a drunk
well you would have to keep it under control
and what if just say there was a kidnap attempt
it is not exactly a scam crease even at half speed you are pretty damn good
a bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time willing to talk i am not good at that
what are you doing here
i came to visit you
bullshit i have known you fifteen years you do not visit
oh now you think i can be trusted
there's still ink on my fingers from last week
you mean a misfire
i mean nothing the hammer came down and nothing happened dimple on the primer
yes or no
i will take the 45 and the webley 32
cut the stock here the barrel here make sure you file it smooth  rocket launchers
do you like dogs mr creasy
if they like me
frank does not take to most people do you speak german
that is 'bird' emilio forgot to take him with when he left
who's emilio
in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch does that sound alright mr creasy
where are you from creasy
the united states
why not
are you going to quit my last bodyguard quit
let me guess you would not stop talking
someone gave him more money than we could
i am a bargain
being black is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico
we are taking a different way home
it was not a school like yours and there was no sister anna
so you were unhappy
and do not start crying
pinta do you have a pencil
you are fast
what are you doing
calling for emilio's macaw i thought i heard him
do you think he will come back
how do you think he got out
well i let him go
it is better to be free right
they will be back in a week
i do not think they are broken anywhere else
the night you arrived mom asked you if you had a family and you lied did not you
do you always sleep with him
i am too old for him do not tell my friends
does not matter i always finish second
why do you ask
well it is a sort of wife
but the emperor of china had 1000 of them how can that be
in the west it is one wife for one husband but different cultures have different rules
it must be difficult having lots of wives
you feel sorry for the husband
so how come you know so much about those countries
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there also i enjoy history
what did you do in asia is that where you met the man with cigarettes
i do not understand
good things happen too creasy  like meeting me
did you used to
you are late
i am sorry
where is my mother
i dropped her at home
i am not afraid you creasy
i know you are not
the gunshot holds no fear say it
i am tough creasy i am tough as you
that is so important in los angeles
your father has business
the blocks
could i ask you a question
could i stop you
you do not drink like you used to
that is not a question
i know because i go in your room and check the bottles
still not a question
you think too much
pinta we have got to go travel sucks at this time
do not be a baby you are tougher than that
there's no such thing as tough creasy just trained and untrained
then be trained
i am going to keep people safe someday just like you
you got that right
the world of our children how dare they
it is war the weakest suffer the most
you are american
mr creasy i wanted to make sure you have everything you need
i am fine
is the food alright maria tells me that you did not eat
how are you getting along with pinta
we will be okay once she realizes i am not a new toy
you should know they are tenacious when they want something and pinta wants to be friends
look maybe this is not going to work maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone more sociable
it makes it all seem so serious
it is serious mrs ramos
why are you here why did not you die
they planned it samuel and kalfus
you are lying i do not believe you
creasy wait
rosanna guerrero

of course i care about pinta she will be as beautiful as her mother one day
i know you need to please lisa an ass like that is hard to find good bodyguards are even harder
and lisa will be able to save face we will not be the only family without a bodyguard
her beauty fucks with your mind

our child's safety is at stake
my wife mr creasy
he has experience in related work a great deal of it
i think it is nice he is american
i think it is fantastic
creasy pinta likes him

that is ridiculous
i have just been so busy lisa
it will be a hard break
she is young she will get over it
[a bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old the bodyguard's american not only that he is black]
[he will die of his wounds bleed to death before he can do anything]
[i know this your point]
[is it true creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday]
[when you talked to him did he look sane]
[no not by the rules of polite society at least]
[you only fuck me to get information]
[you only give information so you can fuck me]
[and as long as we are talking information there's something else as well]
he is not a cop killer
pollo pibil chicken and chorizo sausage hmmmh they marinate it in lemon and orange juice it is a stew really
tell me about your friend creasy
you just said it he is my friend nothing else to say
i read the file you and creasy have been seen quite a bit together
two tourists who never went home
you helped him get this job
the kind that gets divorced but still stay friends
none of your business or mine for that matter i got nothing more to say
pinta martin ramos is just a number to you tragic a public outcry but a number one more dead

that is there to do you found the sliver
my name's hawkeye pierce

where you from with that crazy way of talking
crabapple cove maine
damn that must be about as far north as you can get
that is the initials 'mp' stand for hawkeye
must be the famous curb service whore   house you in the market duke
well there it is jesus
what do you think of that piece of scenery yankee boy
colonel blake have no fear hawkeye and duke are here
little light reading matter just right for his age
well southern boy i suppose you want the sack that is convenient to the door
now that is what i call real pretty we can close up here and go into his belly
christ almighty i think he means it
we have stuck it out for a whole week now pretty girl
no hawkeye just said it all
except we forgot one other small thing
that is that
the chestcutter
yeah that is right  you better get us a chestcutter before there's trouble
this outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded
must be painlees pole day in the shower tent
you met him walt waldowski the dental officer
this kid looks like a loser maybe we better get the beadjiggler to put in a fix
and you have had a natural four times in a row in a crap game right does that mean
not without lots of praying and kissing the dice  it is a different ritual but it works the same
y'all just act natural
never mind forget it
when will he be able to write
that is he got to write for god's sake
how can you say a thing like that about an officer in the united states army
i not only say it i will back it up twenty buck's worth
where the hell we going to get us a football team
never heard of him
sure you have only as 'spearchucker' jones
look at the size of those two beasts
me too y'all just seen me play my last game
any time whenever we want
there's no transportation anyway this time of night
we could steal one of the choppers
hell man that do not matter we are loaded we were big wheels in the black market in seoul
let's hear from you you goddam yankee be nice to see you some time
i have a tent to myself
people will talk
i think it is a marvelous letter
we are a good team
we think the same way
it is supper time  but you are not hungry are you
ravenous what about you
well sure if you are margaret
godless buffoons all of them
wait a second
is that liquor
give us this day our daily
you ever caught this bread and forgive our syndrome before duke
i was just asking
but what about major houlihan
you mean hot lips screw her
you willing to bback that up with odds
pierce that soldier requires immediate attention i am a surgeon and i know
now general i am going to sandbag you do you think we are ready to get out of this belly
well it is still pretty much in the talk stage
we had a team at the 325th evac last fall i coached the boys myself
hawkeye's asking the major's opinion on a point of anatomy
anegative i have crossmatched it
i though you said we did not have a drop
what for
we need medical officers for short arm inspection starting the first afternoon out
bert right see you tomorrow
i think i have seen this nut somewhere  have not i
but i turned in my knee pads
black capsule
we are throwing him a last supper we came to invite you
or you can let him knock himself out you personally would be sending him to his grave
we stand behind all our work
very well your majesty  congratulations frank he picked you
no no that one
i am not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart
but besides the operation we have got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf
come on trapper we got to forget golf for today
i do not know why as long as it is light enough to see your caddie
is he out
for you trapper
it is in pretty deep
we will need room the sixth rib goes
never mind the conversation do it dad
you aspirate the blood from the chest cavity damn there's more of it than i thought
i do not feel anything
i cannot feel it now either the mother must have gone in
what do we do
it is five minutes into nurses' shower hour where are they
so what makes you think he will play for us
we will cut him in on the bets we make and still have enough profit to send hojon to college
might make kind of a social issue not having any other negro officer
but we would have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good
captain pierce would i be imposing
all of them
that is right we work well together
i have noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'hawkeye'
it is my name maybe that sounds silly to you but
i wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the army medical corps
listen we look pretty lousy out there right
the bastards outconned us
i think we could still have a chance
that is the matter
see you
it is possible
thank you captain pierce  it is been so long
no trouble at all  hawkeye
how did you get called that
you are getting a workout you and captain forrest your first night
it is not always this rough
oh no we have dull stretches every week or so thank god when there's nothing to do after midnight
they do not have to be dull i mean if you and me put our minds together
our minds
for a start i just have a hunch well it is not entirely a hunch
you are an attractive man
you have a certain modest charm yourself
but i am married
something else we have in common
very happily married
same here
and absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband do we have that in common captain
of course not
it is terribly hard sometimes the temptation is just too much
then why not as long as it would not hurt anybody
i could not have slept tonight anyhow
you are leaving tomorrow
in less than twelve hours i will be on my way
that is when the real strain starts three weeks on a troopship  poor baby
dear sweet hawkeye
though i guess who it will really be rough on is your husband
you are on his side all of the sudden
a man would be more considerate he would not come home to his wife a nervous wreck
how would he avoid it as if i needed to ask
it could be a purely impersonal thing what matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions
you are asking for somebody else
it happens to be a matter of life and death
you think he will not
what do you care you will be on your way to japan
i am fond of painless and i would feel terrible if anything happened to him
it is your decision maria i do not want to highpressure you
twoman job how much blood has he had
it was really nice of you to take me along
i did not have much choice
captain camembert captain camembert
excuse me sergeant
yes reverend
what do you want with those two medical officers
he is the pro from dover and i am the ghost of smokey joe
that is the story
well one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eightpound americanjapanese male
he is coming to
if a man is not a man anymore that is he got left to live for
tell me the whole story walt
there's this native broad works in the laundry i do not know if you have noticed
but i had this feeling i ought to make the effort to test myself and i flunked
you have been drawn to other males since you were a kid
no never in the slightest
just in dreams
that is really what i came here for see what you guys recommend
in the direction you want to go
morning painless how they going
good morning captain pierce and captain forrest
you can cut the bow
i have not understood what you means
officer all sleep now yes and i go wash clothes
hi hojon how they going
and if i go to new york the natives there will carry me i do not think so
pain bad hojon
i am colonel blake you fellows just passing through
the blonde dish

okay lieutenant dish i guess she is already involved with somebody here
we will find out what they are when you throw us out
about that chestcutter
i will try dddammit you cannot ask any more than that
stop acting like a colonel henry you know trapper would not sock him without a good reason
fifteenth straight day there have been six o'clock choppers how long can a battle go on

no mortal weapons can kill this creature he is not of this world

who the hell are these guys
i never killed a priest before
they are evil cursed they matter not
and what ritual would that be
the ritual to bring the body of anck sunamun back to life
and how does one do that
by reading the book of the dead
oh yes of course
and then killing your sister
if he arrives before us it will be too late
personally i would like to surrender why can we not just surrender
now go find me a big stick
altar boys
what then robbery extortion kidnapping
none of the above thank you
my very good friend what a surprise
the girl saved my life figured it was the least i could do keep her out of trouble
o'connell i am going to kill you for this

going somewhere
c'mon friend
why do you like to fight so much
beni ya little stinkweed where did you slink off to
you left me you left me in the desert to rot
oh yeah sorry bout that  so who's this guy
this is prince imhotep high priest of osiris
the prince does not like to be touched by other humans a silly eastern superstition i am afraid
yeah well we all got our little problems today do not we
he has come to help mister burns somehow i feel responsible
do not gimme that you never had any scruples
where is your new friend
immune from what
you shall see
what does he want the book for
like what that moses guy did to that pharaoh guy
what just happened
i am sorry it was an accident
miss carnavon gentlemen
what is he doing here
and you think this justifies killing innocent people
i am thinking that if the black book of the dead can bring people back to life 
she is like all the others she will die in the desert
then we will kill her we will kill her and all those with her
and burn the map and retrieve the key
i am willin to go on a little faith here
you will not believe it
so your saying if we find the book made outta gold 
 and read the sacred incantations contained inside it
you think it will send this guy back to hell
which would be located not far to the east of the anubis statue
do not tell me we gotta go back out there
see that proves it old seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand
i would not trade ya for a brass spittoon
the sun turning black
you bastards
the hell with that i am not going nowhere we are safe here
the hell with this i am goin downstairs to get me a drink you want something
and what is he in prison for
i did not know so when i heard you were coming i asked him that myself
and what did he say
where are they taking him
no women allowed
i will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life
i would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang
you lie
are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find the city of the dead truly
yes and if you cut him down we will give you ten percent
a bright good morning to all

evil the tuaregs and the bedouin believe that hamunaptra is cursed they call it the doorway to hell
you know your history
relax i am the map  it is all up here

well of course i can swim if the occasion calls for it
we are almost there
for what
that thing gets me excited
the things that get you excited
according to bembridge scholars inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment perhaps containing the book of the living
what are those mirrors for
oh my god it is a preparation room
preparation for what
yeah that would bring you back to life

there's some sort of lock here you say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior
a key that is it that is what he was talking about
you two
unlike your brother miss you i do not get you are a whole new brew

i will accept your assurance but i am afraid i do not see your point
forgive me your majesty i am about to make it
and what a great pleasure it is indeed to meet you alexander
and what a delightful idea
ah  you approve
i think it is absolutely charming
i am glad you like it
ah my dear napoleon sometimes i feel that i am not really an emperor as you are
what do you mean
yes  who spoke up
yes captain  have you anything you wish to say
thank you for coming  would you care for a drink
i do not have to tell you of our latest difficulties
what do you have in mind
to be perfectly honest i have not the vaguest idea
are you serious
i do not even know whether a defense is possible
what forces do you have at your disposal
the 21st dragoons about two or threehundred troopers
any cannon
there are none here
where are they
well i believe there are at least 30 guns at sablons
you could have them here by daybreak
is this enough to oppose 40000 men
properly arranged yes
would you be prepared to handle this for me
are you proposing to transfer command to me
in every practical sense yes but officially of course i would have to retain command
i am not insulted
you realize what is at stake
well belliard that is this  what are you doing here  where is the enemy
they are at the gates of paris sire
and where is the army
it is on this road sire following me
paris has surrendered  i do not believe it
unhappily it is true sire
who sent my wife and son out of paris
i do not know sire
and where is joseph
but did she have the best doctors was not there any chance at all to save her
who is there
bertrand sire
i have just had the most vivid dream about josephine
general bonaparte
come back in an hour
excuse me general bonaparte but i believe this is an extremely urgent matter requiring your immediate attention
this dispatch has just arrived from aboukir marked highest priority for general bonaparte's eyes only
i believe you are acquainted with my brother joseph bonaparte and my aide major junot
captain charles i believe you are one of general le clerc's aidesde camp
yes sir i am
was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied madame bonaparte's coach
was the trip normal in every respect
yes sir
did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip
thank you sir  i will do that
yes sir
a glass of champagne please
yes sir  i hope you will excuse me for asking general bonaparte but are you corsican
yes i am
i thought so i noticed your name when you were announced  i am corsican too  my name is arena
oh  where do you come from
i have not been there for three years
i have not been back for ten years is your family still there
no they are living in nice now
that is a nice city  this is your first time here is not it
yes as a matter of fact it is
you do not know many of citizen barras' friends do you
ahhh no
hello there picart
ah didier  you are alive
why are you carrying the dog
his paws are frozen and he cannot walk
when you eat him may i have some
my god  what time is it
four o'clock
when did it start
the first reports came in at about ten
why did not you wake me then
at first it hardly seemed more than a routine fire
how did it spread so quickly
it is the work of incendiaries
i told mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting
our troops have no part in this  it has been started by the russians
the emperor has decided to marry your archduchess marielouise
good morning citizen de beauharnais
good morning sir  are you general bonaparte
i am citizen  is your mother madame josephine de beauharnais
yes sir  are you acquainted with her
and he sent you to me
he said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you
does your mother know you have come
no sir
well then you have a lot of initiative my young friend
my father's sword means more to me than any other possession i have
ah my dear francis what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last
you have made such excellent use of it i should think you will hate to leave it
shall we move closer to the fire
will alexander be joining us soon
i am afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle
my dear francis you do seem extremely uncomfortable
i am afraid i am just a bit
would you like some brandy
thank you
thank you napoleon
good evening sir
the weather is terrible is not it sir
yes it is  it must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter
you must be chilled to the bone standing out of doors like this
yes i am sir
then what brings you out on such a night
well one must do something to live you know  and i have an elderly mother who depends on me
oh i see that must be a great burden
one must take life as it comes  do you live in lyon sir
no i am only here on leave  my regiment is at valence
are you staying with a friend sir
no i have a room at the hotel de perrin
is it a nice warm room sir
well it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street
would you like to take me there so that we can get warm sir
uhhh yes of course  if you would like to go there but i have very little money
brrrr these sheets are like ice
only lisette
lisette la croix
that is a very nice name  where are you from
please sir come into bed or i shall die of a chill
no nothing at all
i know of no better time
you cannot be serious  it would not be good to become another husband out of a moliere farce
the comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already
you must not act impetuously
are you sure that you are not still in love with her
are you trying to insult me
of course not but such violence of feeling makes me wonder
well you shall see
will you use the troops
ah that is good
and you seem in excellent health your highness
oh yes of course  have you met my daughter hortense
yes we introduced ourselves at the door
may i offer you a drink
oh i do not want to put you to any inconvenience
oh it is not the slightest inconvenience general bonaparte it is an honor to have you here
you are very kind madame de beauharnais  do you have some sherry perhaps
were you in love with him
i thought i was  i was confused
and now
now i know that i shall die if you leave me
but you have had mistresses while you were away
of course
were any of them prettier than i am
one had better legs
were any of them married
yes  they were the easiest  i made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting
promise me you will never leave me
i cannot promise you that
promise me
i will never forgive you
i do not care but promise you will never leave me
promises mean nothing
perhaps  but tell me you promise anyway
all right  i promise
yes  what is it
open the door  it is me
go away  i am busy
i know what you are doing in there
do not be ridiculous and go away  i am busy working
where is madame trillaud
how should i know  ask roquier  he is cleaning her dress
will you be joining us soon
i will be there in five minutes  go back to your guests
but you will not be safe
who is it
i believe you sent for me
there's probably some explanation
i gave it to berthier this afternoon
why did you give it to him
i am sorry i thought he would give it to you
i must have the breakdown now where is berthier
he is downstairs  somewhere
why not
well maybe he is only looking out for your best interests
what are you talking about
nothing  that is all i can say
that is all you can say  what are you talking about
look junot you are not going to leave this room until you explain yourself
there are some things better left unsaid
well whatever the hell you wanted to do you are going to tell me everything right now  do you understand
yes i wrote it
you wrote it
i could not face telling you
you could not face telling me what
about hippolyte charles
what was there to tell
my god what do you think
do you know what you are saying
god help me  yes
how do you know
i know
how did you know it was captain charles
i questioned the maid and she admitted charles had been madame bonaparte's lover for several months
can you give me a drink please
and was it so widely known that joseph had reason for such concern
good day monsieur  do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell
my regrets my dear major but i believe you have been blocking the road
if i have given you any cause to be insulted monsieur may i offer you immediate satisfaction
good evening ladies  you must forgive me my dearest wife but i simply could not wait to see you
oh then you are
and you my dear wife do you find that i resemble my portraits
do you like music
yes i do  very much
will i be able to play the harp  it is an instrument of which i am very fond
of course my dear
you are so good to me  will you also allow me to have a botanical garden
you may have anything you wish my sweet and lovely marielouise
i am told that fontainebleau has many lovely views  i know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside
did the emperor or empress give you any instructions of any kind before you left
papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me
does she deserve anything better
those are extremely harsh terms
i did not ask her to go to war against me
has alexander agreed to this
that is correct
what i am talking about is moderation
what you are talking about is a gamble on moderation  when i gamble i prefer to gamble on force
and where do you place alexander
good day to our brothersinarms have you come to join us

come on baby let's go in the house
sir if i may  echo my concern 
you are lawyers  how can you let this shit go by  look  this  nixon cannot say this
you did say it sir
we could check the tape again sir
where the hell is he
uh he is rushing back from his tennis game sir 
so  let's go 
he told me to take you to his conference room
no  his office  i want a very private conversation  i do not want to be bugged
how is the job coming bob
frankly sir it stinks  i have no access  i am lucky helms lets me have a staff
we will see about that 
he is nervous sir  he is heard you are looking for a new director
well he certainly is not acting like it
that is helms  he is sang froid a worldclass poker player
sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify  but they are solid
mr president hunt wants more money another hundredandthirty thousand
mitchell  mitchell's  family
how much do you need
uh i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years 
we could get that
uh huh 
you want me to put it all in writing over my signature
i was sorry to hear about your wife
yes  i got the money
the president would like to know if that was the last payment
i will bet he would
how the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the president of the united states
that is not the question john  the question is why is he paying
to protect his people
i am one of his people  the cubans are his people  and we are going to jail for him
it was her wrist  and it was through a plateglass door
let's not forget they are just kids they do not vote
yeah  sullivan thinks henry's leaking  he is the one 
who's gonna tell mitchell
you do it
why me
'cause he hates you  it is worse when you get it from someone you trust
he is wrong you know  about kennedy lbj truman
the old man plays politics harder than anybody else
it is a code or something
i figured that out
dick nixon saying i am sorry that will be the day  the whole suit of armor would fall off
jesus  did mitchell know
mitchell's out of his mind now martha just put her head through a plateglass window
well sir  it turns out  one of the people implicated is still you see on our white house payroll
hunt  howard hunt
i like it  i like the idea
is it legal  i mean has anyone ever done it before
where is hunt now
he wants money
pay him
this is not a joke john
no sir
i do not know if i would go that far sir
excuse me  are you talking about recognizing china mr president that would cost us our strongest support
we cannot touch hoover 
he is begging for a meeting chief  he wants to go overseas for awhile
what about england
i do not know i do not know  i just know we have made too many enemies
this is june twentieth
 y'know al if hoover was alive none of this would have happened  he would have protected the president
mr hoover was a realist
i trusted mitchell  it was that damn big mouth wife of his
may i say something mr president
you are all set sir  just push this button  good night mr president
you know al men in your profession  you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room
i do not have a pistol
this could trigger the impeachment they will go to the supreme court next
let 'em try  i appointed three of those bastards  i am not giving 'em my tapes
congress is considering four articles of impeachment sir
cox  fire him
victory at sea al  henry  the pacific theatre  christ you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks
your lawyers feel it is the  smoking gun
it is totally out of context  i was protecting the national security  i never intended 
sir the deadline is today
can we get around this al
if you resign you can keep your tapes as a private citizen  you can fight them for years
the army
lincoln used it
that was civil war
we cannot survive this sir  they also have you instructing dean to make the payoff to hunt
there is nothing in that statement the president cannot explain
sir you talked about opening up the whole bay of pigs thing again
that is right 
three days before on the june twentieth tape  the one with the eighteenminute gap 
 they smelled the blood on me this time al  i got soft  you know  that rusty metallic smell 
i know it well sir
they did what  i do not understand why would they go into o'briengs office in the first place
but o'brien does not even use that office  the democrats have moved to miami  there's nothing there
it was just a fishing expedition apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc
we feel the bigger concern is gordon liddy 
definitely  colson had him trying to break into bremer's apartment after bremer shot wallace to plant mcgovern campaign literature
i had nothing to do with that  was he  in the ellsberg thing
yes you approved it sir
i did
it was right after the pentagon papers broke  they went in to get his psychiatric records
fucking hell
well why not
howard hunt  jesus christ you open up that scab  and you uncover a lot of pus
security is not strong enough
how about a comint classification  we put it on the huston plan  even the designation is classified
you approved that before the fact because i went over it with you  but 
the bay of pigs  that was kennedy's screwup  how does that threaten us
just do what i say bob
yes sir but  do you think gray will go for it
pat gray will do anything we ask him that is why i appointed him
he will need a pretext  he will never figure one out for himself
christ you are right  gray makes jerry ford look like mozart  just have helms call him  helms can scare anybody
the only problem with that sir  it gets us into obstruction of justice
it is got nothing to do with justice it is national security
i will talk to helms  oh pat asked if you are coming to the residence for dinner tonight
meanwhile what happens to the country
where are they
he was not protecting me  he was putting me on notice
what  that he knew johnny roselli hoover knew a lot of gangsters
the first assassination attempt was in '60 just before the election
 he would just found out about track 2
no  a little deficit will not hurt jesus they are serious  why are we stopping
get that little fucker  great tackle reminds me of my days at whittier most of these kids are useless
mr president
and his staff  come on the copy they were filing from china was great
the jews are not the middle henry they are the far left
you are talking too much about black africa henry  it is killing us with the rednecks
the blacks are lost the schwartzes are gone 
gentlemen i think it is about time for us to be getting to the airport
i believe you are right boss
congratulations boss  a great victory  the madman theory was not so crazy after all
because they are not americans
 beating out the other papers chasing girls 
you played it perfectly sir  cocksucker  he is going to think twice before he leaks again
it is helms  it is got to be
i promised iran to townsend
put townsend in belgium it is available
richard  come with me would you 
yes mother 
do not tell a lie richard  the cornsilk cigarette harold gave thee behind the store this morning
i do not  have them  mother  i swear i  did not smoke
i see  well then richard we have nothing more to talk about do we
please mother it  it was just one time mother i am  i am sorry
we have not said grace yet  richard
i cannot 
it is a gift richard  this law school is a gift from your brother
what about happiness mother
what would he say
what do you think  he said in life there's no free ride
what would you say
oh no harold  he does not respond well to humor  maybe if you talk to mother she can 
mom expects great things from you 
i am honored dick that you have come all this way out here to virginia to visit us at last
my friends call me mister president
diem  trujillo  lumumba  guatemala cuba  it is a shame you did not take similar precautions dick
president kennedy threatened to smash the cia into a thousand pieces  you could do the same 
i am not jack kennedy  your agency is secure
current levels may not be sufficient
we have recent intelligence that a soviet nuclear submarine has docked at cienfuegos
are you tapping kissinger
my job unpleasant sometimes is to know what others do not want me to know
mr helms we have lived with communism in cuba for ten years 
by offering cuba to the russians as a consolation prize
cuba would be a small price to pay
i want to see him tomorrow clyde
edgar think twice  he works in the kitchen
not joaquin you idiot  nixon  did you hear what he said in oregon about me having too much power
 little bobby
my father built the house where i was born with his own hands  oh it was not a big house 
oh my goodness 
how about you  are you going to win
cannot we just talk here  i have got the police chiefs in san diego
roselli  johnny roselli
yes  your old friend from cuba
i never met the man
yeah well as i said edgar 
you asked if you could count on my support  as long as i can count on yours
we cannot keep a goddamn secret in this government edgar  they are stealing papers right out of his office
johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office
we took his system out
that was a mistake  the white house was full of kennedy people then  it still is
i always get my man
how the fuck did you know
injections  even this noble sport's been fixed  seen the guys
why you got a customer
the white house
you are fucking me
we are gonna be plumbers frank  we are gonna plug a leak
who we working for
where would you find him
just do not tell him to do anything you do not really want him to do
so does tricky dick know about this
howard  what the hell  what are you doing
mein kampf
a warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk nietzsche
let's get the fuck out of here shall we ladies
anything goes wrong head for your homes just sit tight  you will hear from me or howard
like you said jack i am just a new york lawyer now
she is quite pretty
so that is this about dick
it is me or wallace jack  wallace's third party is only going to help mcgovern  i need your support
desi's got a point  what the hell are we gonna do about the communists right here in our backyard
because if you are uncomfortable with the epa up your ass try the irs 
well goddamn  are you threatening me dick
fuck it  he does not like me john  it is your fault henry
alright henry  we are gonna go your way  crush this ellsberg character the same way we did hiss
churchill degaulle disraeli  they all went through the pain of losing power
that is triangular diplomacy gentlemen
that is right  and if necessary i will drop the big one
you will pick up the middle on this one  the jews and negros
housecleaning  it would be ugly henry really ugly 
but it must be done your government is paralyzed
all kinds of shit would come out like the ellsberg thing  you knew about that henry did not you
i  i heard something  it sounded idiotic
you have many friends  and admirers 
do you ever pray  you know  believe in a supreme being
 uh i hope this does not embarrass you
not at all  this is not going to leak is it
you know mr chairman at harvard i used your writings in my class
what a waste of time  my writings mean absolutely nothing
secret mr chairman
i was asleep mr president  what can i get you
just  uh  you know
do you miss cuba manolo
yes mr president
we let you down did not we  your people
that was mr kennedy
he was a politician
i do not know  he made me see the stars 
i must say you look very good mr chairman
looks can be deceiving 
mr chairman there is an old saying the enemy of my enemy is my friend
you know i voted for you in your last election
civil war is always the cruelest kind of war
yes well  gentlemen i promised my wife  i am out of politics
you just came down here for the weather right mr nixon
so  how is the food over there in china mr nixon
how about kissinger along with him
hiss was protecting his wife  i have always believed that
sorry dick  she is a little tipsy
you mean smashed  she called up at midnight last week  talking a bunch of crap  pat cannot stand her
it is a thing she does  she talks at night
talks all day too  how the hell can you put up with her john
goes to show you all the moolah in the world cannot buy you a brain
well he seems to have bought kissinger
the jewboy's a harvard whore with the morals of an eel  sells himself to the highest bidder
you are the one who should be in politics john  you are tougher than i am  you never crack
uh wait 
you need her dick  in '60 she was worth five six million votes
how many
four  two boys  two girls  and eight wounded
you all right
my brother harold was about the same age as those kids john  tuberculosis got him
you are doing the right thing dick  do not let 'em shake you
it broke my heart when harold died
get off that  that leads nowhere you should offer condolences to the families of those kids

you expect to hold cornwallis with militia
i expect to try
trust you and harry lee  remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit fort louis
i say we drink the wine shoot the dogs and use the papers for musket wadding
am i one of that sort
cheerful news to greet the morn
personally i would prefer stupidity
he reminds me of you before you got old and ugly
what do you mean old and ugly
you got me beat on both accounts
he should not make light  that redcoat should not have been killed
you do not know him very well do you
you got salt last week
oh right  baking powder we need baking powder
they are from good stock on their mother's side
you look well charlotte
and send us to war alongside massachusetts
how did this how did i let this happen
thomas is dead but you have done nothing for which you should be ashamed
if you go i will care for them as if they were my own
excuse me
i said i am not my sister
i know that
do you
of course i do
you are surrendering
yes sir
what unit
first virginia regulars under colonel hamilton
we did
my boys my boys you seem to have been well fed  thank you for that colonel
my pleasure sir
please forgive me for keeping you waiting
apology accepted
thank you colonel i am afraid i do not know your name
colonel will do
i served in his majesty's army in the french and indian war
oh  very well then  would you as the initiating party like to begin
you are familiar with how these things are done  in fact i would like to claim aggrieved status
thank you
please accept my apology for not having done so sooner
apology accepted  now on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements this is absolutely unacceptable
restrain them from the targeting of civilians including women and children
that is a separate issue
very well let us move on to
you have eighteen of my men  i want them back
i do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death but i hold no prisonersofwar
if that is your position then eighteen of your officers will die nineteen if you hang me with my men
colonel tarleton you deal with these damned rebels
it seems our swamp fox wants to have a formal parley
are you going to meet with him
how can we end this madness
civility is a secondary virtue  it is superseded by duty
do you see that colonel
father a post rider came from charleston  you have a letter inside
the new york and rhode island assemblies have been dissolved
anything about the convention in philadelphia
what news
the british army is barricaded in boston  harry lee is here from virginia recruiting for a continental army
is that why the assembly was convened
yes  he seeks a levy of troops and money
and the governor
he vowed that if the assembly votes a single shilling to lee he will dissolve the body
father i have lost respect for you i thought you were a man of principle
when you have children i hope you will understand
have you seen any redcoats
i have to get these dispatches to hillsboro
you are in no condition to ride
what now sir
we put out the word  we will start along the south side of the santee
we would cover more ground if we split up
is that so
did your father teach you humility
and corporal   be careful
is it
if you are here only for revenge you are doing a disservice to him as well as yourself
how old are you
you know how old i am
less than a mile  fortyone wagons a company of redcoat infantry horses at the rear
flanking riders
these four wagons must be his
gabriel  are you asleep
fourteen dead eleven wounded eighteen captured
stay the course your mother used to say that to me when i would get drunk or lose my temper
she would say it to me when i picked on thomas or nathan
you learned her lessons better than i
she spoke  susan spoke
full sentences  as if she had been speaking all along
she said she loves you and misses you but she understands why you cannot be there with her
sir i would like to request a furlough two days
granted  where are you going
cheraw falls
it is beautiful there  your mother and i were there once before you were born
do not go in there
is it her  is anne in there
father tell me what happened at fort wilderness
you know what happened
tell me what everyone does not know
that is right
that is why it was four years between you and thomas  it took me that long to regain her respect
it was a different time son  and you are a better man than that
if this war is about more than thomas it is about more than anne as well  stay the course
he wanted to susan but he could not leave his men
he left us
there are some letters here from him  some are just to you
i do not care  i hate him
you do not hate him
i stand corrected
captain marion i understood you to be a patriot
it is mister marion
damn it francis  how in god's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war
a long time ago
thirteen years
you were an englishman then
there are a thousand avenues other than war at our disposal
name five hundred
royal petition delegates to court judicial redress economic boycott bribery
that is five keep going
 time royal succession regicide bribery
and your principles
i recognize him now  is he as imprudent as his father was at his age
no thank the lord  he is more like his mother
i will see to it that he serves under me
green dragoons came to my home killed my son thomas  it was tarleton himself
i am sorry
i am sorry i was not here for this
there's nothing you could have done gates is a damned fool
where is he now
last anyone saw riding hard northeast his staff a hundred yards behind trying to catch up
who's in command
i am i think
fall six months at the earliest
you expect cornwallis to be held here by militia
they would be better off but the cause would not be
how many men does cornwallis have under his command
his wife was killed yesterday  she was with child
do not touch him
how many men have we seen die
goodbye francis
and congratulations on the birth of your son
thank you  maybe all of this will buy him some peace
your son what did you name him
lord cornwallis will be with you presently
thank you
you may of course keep your weapons but i must warn you that
i am familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley
yes quite but you should know that
that will be all major  i will wait for lord cornwallis
how far away
do not worry
we could go stay at aunt charlotte's farm  she is to the west
but what about thomas
thank you
for what
for trying to impose some decency on that sort
it is a good measure of a woman that she will have her honeymoon under the stars
how many came back
colonel let us help his soul find it is place with the almighty and
he looks as if he is sleeping does not he
i was sorry to hear about your son
i lost another a year ago thomas he was only fifteen
francis tell me about general cornwallis
remember braddock
but it is already been two years and that is two more years  the war could be over by then
put those away
but father they might come this way

you should be maybe lednov heard about that sonora ranch of yours
maybe he did
we are going to look for him want to come along
i have got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed
and that is more important than finding lednov
who shot who
that is she doing running around the country at night
i would not know did you ask her
all i can get out of her is she do not care about living
look of things she does not
you do not know how good it is to see you
it does not matter who they are
and one of 'em is sick
anybody hurt
that is the matter with her
this must have been in the family a long time
and this is helen carter
yes ma'am
as far as  sonora
they will not be riding in the wagon
did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over sonora pass it is quite a job
you cannot leave us here
what good is it going to do us to go to some ranch
you can stay here if you like
we have to get to sonora there are jobs waiting for us there we will pay you for your trouble
our kind of women
that is the matter with her
and this is helen carter
so am i
thanks and is not there something we can do about supper  or making the beds
steve and me we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp
but you eat do not you
mostly we open a can of beans and boil some coffee
of course it will work you can get another girl to fill out the act
if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home
steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire
would you mr phillips
like what
get back to the horses they are straggling
he is learning his letters
learning to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street
are the horses straggling or are not they
they are straggling
but the nearest shelter's the wyatt ranch and that is maybe five hours away
so that was why she tried to run away
hold on
we cannot stay here
no thanks  i hope we will not be a burden to them
i am sorry but that is how it is got to be
i suppose it is
you do not have to explain did i tell you how grateful i am for what you have done
you have earned it  the horse ranch on the toulomoe  the girl in the spotted gingham
the who
i will make the soap myself
but the rest is right
will she be dark or fair
he knows his alphabet
are we leaving
better go on back and get some more sleep you will need it later on
why did you change your mind about bringing us along
you know so much about me  figure it out
you would not do a thing like that would you
you should have i do not like leaving things unfinished
maybe it is better that way
what did you expect speeches i do not mean
all right  it is said
no i am not all right i am soaked and i hit myself against that rock
all my clothes 
so grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance
if you want to go on i can make it all right
i will not have you fighting over me
maybe it is not going to sonora but it is going somewhere which is all right with me
it is going to sonora
i cannot change either not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand
goodbye thanks for the lift
goodbye mary
thanks for taking over
thanks for loading me on the stage i know now why you did it
where you going

so did i they were in it
here's a man says he is looking for you girls
i  lost something
stretch out under the seat miss
which ranch
how does she draw
that is right
who's lednov
you might tell a fellow things 'specially if the fellow's your brother seems to me
like why you are buying a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden
i do not want to run short
you never said this lednov's name before that i can remember
what was he in jail for
you sure worry that bone he killed a fellow
in a fight
at the ranch maybe
maybe at the ranch maybe sooner than that
do you have to be so closemouthed i am your brother and i am riding with you remember
that is lednov  we come along here
and meet him there
sure a lot of guys looking for lednov
they sure must have been traveling this keeps up we can start a store
there was only three of them at first i guess i lost my head
how would you happen to miss
they were quite a ways off and the wind was blowing i did not have them to aim
a man cannot help getting excited once in a while
that is right steve
can i have my gun back
it is all right with me if she teaches you but i do not want you forgetting your job
sure i remember you went to mexico looking for cattle
you remember jeff rawson  we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high
sure i do went off down to mexico or something
that is what i told you then only he did not lednov killed him
yeah it does
finished son
do not go arguing with your teacher
want the wagon unloaded clay
i did not stop to think clay
all right i hurt your feelings but you know better than to go lighting fires
come on we got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep
go on hit me
sit down and eat till i say the word you are doing what you are told
you oughta say you are sorry  that is what you oughta do
you know what she asked me
i do not care what she asked you
it is so your fault and and i guess maybe when we hit the ranch you andme better
half of them are mine
is that the only reason you came back
sure what other reason would there be
how is that
kind of sore
you will live
guess maybe i am old enough to hold my own in a fight huh
yeah  but do not make a habit of it
so  maybe i am old enough to tell you how to run your life
you can light the lamp  i am sure glad it is you we were afraid those killers might come back
yeah how did you know
i am sorry about this mr wyatt i did not know who she was
all right you did not know
i cannot take her with me
you are not being quite fair
i am sorry about this mr wyatt i did not know you had a daughter
all right you did not know
i cannot take her with me
you are not being quite fair
you cannot stay here there's snakes and it is cold and you will just get sicker
i do not care
suppose that lednov was to have found you instead of me why you would not have had a chance
i said i did not care
running off and worrying people making it tougher on clay than it is already
do not ask me because i will not tell you i will not tell anybody go away
do not act so  crazy
i am sorry let's go
helen  why do not you and mary go on with clay
he will not take us  do not you want us around

up here in the hills a man gets a hankering to smell powder
you are sure there's more where this came from
i saw your fire and dropped by to say hello
that is the matter  restless
yes people make me restless
even women
there are not any women here
suppose i take a look
when i ask questions i like to hear answers

there you are now take it easy and you will be all right
aspen does not want us mr graham they threw us out

i tried my best but these things take time
and we are running out of that
how long do you think we will have to stay here

he certainly could about a month
you are not giving up
maybe i better start working on him

see this is why we are not watching those news reports people get obsessed  i am letting go now
i think it is contaminated
it is not contaminated it is just tap water pour it in his bowl
it tastes funny
not english though you heard the voices right uncle merrill
the same windows
i do not want you to die
i am scared
hi sweetie
i was just taking a walk before dinner
does it hurt
tell morgan to play games  it is okay to be silly
i will
tell bo to listen to her brother he will always take care of her
i will
tell graham 
i am here
and tell merrill to swing away
i got the bat at home on the wall
five the five longest
explain act crazy
curse and stuff
i am not going to curse
you do not mean it it is just for show
it does not sound natural when i curse
just make noises then
explain noises
are you going to do this or what
no i am not
i cursed
it was very dark
it was very dark
this guy got on the roof in like a second
that roof is over ten feet high
pharmacy crowded
it is noise
it is probably picking up another baby monitor
morgan be careful
how can you say that
that was not the answer you wanted
that is furry furry rabbit
that is a game is not it  anyway  there's been some interesting developments
what time is it
where are you going
i am sorry what book is this
chicken teriyaki
should we turn off the lights
they are on the roof
this is going to do nothing
did i ever tell you i dislocated uncle merrill's arm
should we make a run for it out the back
he was only a year and half old
we will not be able to get out of there
they are distracting us
i can feel air
me too
it is getting stronger
they are broadcasting
how many died
they think over a hundred thousand they are just estimates  but we held strong
how do they know it is over
he is been like that for awhile we need to get him some medicine
have they said anything about our area
he is not strong enough to fight off another attack
that is good enough for me
it needs batteries
these are d's i need double a's
it is still making the noises it is broken
we might lose the signal
i am getting out now
scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs
that is two
we will have to board up the bedroom doors
where are we going to sleep
what about isabelle
french toast and mashed potatoes
stop crying
they will read our minds

did someone save me
it is the strangest thing father
do not call me father
that is that
you said something was strange that is strange
the footprints
what about them
it is not broken
second thing this week i cannot explain
you cannot describe him at all do not you think that is find of odd
it does seem kind of odd does not it
i do not know whether to look for a midget or a 
he definitely was not a midget
okay  so he was tall
i do not think so
it is good advice  say hi to marcia for me
there was an accident drunk driving they were not sure
is he okay
she is not in an ambulance father
the truck the truck has severed most of her lower half
do not do it
they think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver
it is like war of the worlds
the book says they are probably very good problem solvers

i would get down if i were you they may be up there now

i told you this was a sweet setup
it is that
easy boy just an idea
what is it you want from me
nothing do nothing do not get between us
i am a great believer in doing nothing
i am going to have to look into this

i never could count on you to be reasonable  do not force me to make an adjustment around here
cobb you have got nothing i need
i am not thinking about your future paden i am worried about stella

yeah bad luck  goodbye cobb
you work here
the world is what you make of it friend if it does not fit you make alterations
stella are you the midnight star herself
my compliments to you miss stella this is what i call a saloon
thanks that is what i call it too
and i know what i am talking about
you like a good saloon
it is the only place i am happy
you would not be needing any help around here would you maybe with the gambling
yeah aside from being a loudmouthed lying cheat he is just the man i would have picked
why would you go into business with him
i do not own this place the man who does stuck me with kelly
who's the owner
is this a fair mix
i am saving lives here the straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather
that is this
that is the good stuff
you really are a gambler
where is the dog now
what is it that i cannot figure
what do you mean
what makes you say that
if he did not you would never sit still while this was happening
i like your attitude but it can be risky
how about you
i do not want you to get hurt
i have got a place i can hide her
stella this is one of my oldest surviving friends treat him right
that was my plan
it is an advance we want him to know he is going to be happy here
i would not worry about that
that is right  you understand perfectly  i will confess to fraud not murder
a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions  also bogus
oh no  the fan club is real  but they were worshipping computer code  ones and zeros
so of course you could not kill simone because there never was a simone
can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who did not exist
it was not her body  it was her body of work
why do not you just come clean viktor  tell the truth  you will feel better afterwards
it sounds like you still have feelings for him
okay  for you
thanks  this is my exit so i 
of course she is  no other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her
no  you will not give in to that blackmailing bitch
god viktor  why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself
 do you know what these are elaine
 viktor that was short subject
 it is called a projector
you can have everything  office car assistants  all i want is the picture
the picture's dead
so there's no problem  i can have the rights the negative too
where is she
good to see you too elaine
why is not she with you
viktor i want to thank you for convincing simone to sign with the studio
almost right
i cannot wait to meet her
i do not know if that is going to happen
do not be ridiculous  i arranged a press conference
out of the question  a circus like that
viktor it is my studio
sorry i did not get her back in time
no problem  do you want to come in
whatever  i still have not received simone's script notes
there are not any  if the filmmakers are happy simone's happy  she considers herself an instrument
really  oh so she is really going to do all this nudity
well something has to be done about this budget  it is completely unrealistic  you allowed nothing for limousine service
she will drive herself
hair and makeup
she will do her own  theater training
she was in the theater  when where
i will send you her resume
al least a contingency for wardrobe  any woman can go up a dress size
 i guarantee she will not gain an once  she is very disciplined
well we have to do something about this  stuntwoman
what about it
there is not one
no need  she does all her own stunts
even the fall from the plane
even the fall from the plane
which accounts for your percentage  when do i get to meet this dream
not today  she is learning her lines  you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget
simone does not control my destiny
stunning viktor  the hollywood foreign press is going to eat this up
i got them to remove the reflection  the mirror's metaphor  to show how her character's inwardly dead
that is genius viktor  was that simone's idea
maybe you are right  twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father
better late than never
i should fire you more often  the film's looking wonderful
thank you  i will tell simone you liked it
i would love to tell her myself  when are you going to let me meet her
soon  soon
everyone i know has met her viktor
everyone you know is lying
 you cannot go in there
so the secret's finally out viktor
the premiere was the first time i have convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares
viktor you should have said something
she does not want pity
oh make it live  please viktor
she was there  she did not by any chance happen to mention me
elaine what are you doing tonight would you like to go somewhere  dinner
i would love to  but are not you supposed to meet up with simone
are you and simone   getting married
viktor do you realize you always do that
do what
whenever i compliment simone you take the credit
i do
yes you do  anyway tonight was a good start
excuse me  start
my two favorite girls
she is lying down  she is exhausted
as a matteroffact i am
when is she coming over
about now  would you like a drink
is simone back to earth yet
i just read somewhere 
i know  i know  they will say anything
 she already is  simone's not coming over elaine  not tonight not ever  i want you back elaine
this is crazy  who am i fooling i cannot compete with simone  what woman can
no  she will never work again  retire never make a movie or a record or appear ever again
of course she will  her public will demand it
can i see you later  go away for the weekend
thank you  i do not know how you did it but thank you
do not thank us too fast viktor you know what we have to do
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast
i was thinking  what about you and simone moving back in with me and lainey
do not look so glum viktor  it is not a death sentence
hello is this elaine
yes  oh my god  is that you simone  i have been wanting to talk to you
well here i am  you look pretty today  red suits you
where are you
thank simone for the tickets
let's go lainey  there's nothing here
because obviously she existed right
i know it as surely as you are sitting here sweetheart  she was the most vital woman i ever met
so you did meet her
of course  what are you suggesting
well i 
 we do not believe daddy because we do not want to believe we were taken in too
lainey there's no evidence that simone is not real
you had no choice elaine  he is a liability
elaine do you realize you cannot stop talking about viktor
you understand you will have to come back to my place to keep them off the er   scent
of course
you look so so
 so much like her
yes of course but very beautiful in your own right
what what did you say
do what you do to simone
what i do to simone
you are with me to be close to her
why are we here  is that what you are asking jack why are we here  no why  just here
who are you really
no i am okay
let's talk about the work that you care so much about
sure  where would you like to start
how about the nudity
nudity has just never been an issue for me frank  for me clothes are just an option
 simone the question on everyone's mind is simply why
that is true  i can reveal that i am considering a career in politics
nicola anders is the only actress who can play that role
viktor i am so happy for us
hello hal
the film  the chemistry  no reflections on nicola but simone and i  we were just so right together
yes perfect  as a matter of fact i ran into simone on the lot the other day
you will never guess who i am with you ran into him on the lot
how will you do our love scenes
body double
hal what are you doing
viktor clyde simply has to get close to simone in this scene  he has to touch her  he has to
absolutely not
but she is right there  i must feel her
you cannot
why not
there's a wall between you 
 an emotional wall i know that is why 
 no  no  a real wall  you ran right through it
is she here
i am fine hal  how are you
you know i sometimes forget she has bodily functions
i know what you mean
 please get away from me
i did it mr taransky  i licked skin  i licked hair  i licked every part of her
you want me to call security
i have her mr taransky  the answer to your prayers  the answer to this
i was misquoted
that is right  you were booed off the stage  that is got to be  
 eight years ago  in that whole time i never left my computer
i am sorry
you have to see her
i have seen them all before
not like this 
come on hank  a synthespian virtual actor  
 we call them vactors
i need flesh and 
 flesh is weak
it can  with my new computer code you and me we can do it together
i do not know anything about computers
that is why you are so perfect  you have something i do not have
you do
straw god changed my life
listen hank it is been a rough day  i will call you about his next week
i will not be here next week  the tumor's inoperable  i will be dead
harry  harry  can we have a minute  what brings you here tonight
i just came out to support my good friend simone
there's a rumor that you are more than just good friends
we have been seeing each other sure but we would rather keep our relationship private
do i hear the sound of wedding bells
hi dad
i am sorry mom canned you
i am going to finish the picture sweetheart  it is important
hi dad
your mother could not make it
she is at the premiere of a cold day in hell  but i think she send someone from acquisitions
she still with kent
not quite how i imagined it 
 you finished the film on your own terms that is what matters did you really do all the post yourself
there was no other way
i missed you  i wondered if you were ever coming back
me too
well i cannot wait to meet simone that is her last name
you know i do not know
is she here tonight
she is a miracle dad  where did you find her
dad i can spot a middleaged freak a mile away
okay  but you have to find a way to escape that thing
i read
you do  still  i cannot tell you how happy i am to hear that
you were the one who insisted on it  reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four
okay dad
if anyone asks about simone 
 i know i do not know anything
exactly  do not you wonder where i am really hiding simone
one thing bothered me
goodnight daddy
hey lainey  how is your love life
i do okay  how about you
you know me  married to my work
really  too bad
she thinks you are with simone
dinner  dinner's difficult  a phone call
i love you lainey
why did not she thank you
happy birthday lainey  do you like it
it is fantastic  it is too much
it is the car she drove in eternity forever
 i cannot accept it  i do not want a car dad
about you and mom
i did not kill anyone bernard there was no one to kill
do i know you
max sayer  national echo
do not you have a real story to write  why are not you in latin america
this is the story
nice boat taransky
it is a yacht
i know what you are up to
i do not have time for this sayer
it is bogus  you used an old library shot for the background
the background is
i have done my homework  i have studied her
alright sayer you have got a deal
what now sayer
i traced her to a nursing home  a young woman fitting simone's description dropped her off five years ago
she looks a lot like you
that does not prove a thing  wait until i get a court order for a blood test
i would not want you to compromise your ethics
you love her do not you max
do not you
is it a jamming device
maybe he is talking to himself
we have got our best people on it mr sayer
well we got some of taransky's fingerprints a lot of your fingerprints but none of hers
my god you have got one
mr sayer
what do you want  
 i have been here before  on my honeymoon with my exwife
it is a hotel
i do not understand
 nicola  how was your massage
you are in breach
taller viktor

i had three other offers  i only signed on to this picture out of loyalty
would you like me to read
you know you are really very good i take back what i said  i mean you are really good
thank you
you could play the lead
you would cosmetically alter simone to look like me
what if it catches on fire
i will do anything to please you mr taransky
i am sorry i did not catch that what did you say
simone are you there
let's take it down a notch
good morning simone
good morning mr taransky
you mean they buy it
is that better mr taransky
you did create me
no  i just helped bring someone else's dream to life
are you ever going to tell the truth about me mr taransky
the only real truth is in the work
your pa's waiting for you up at the house
maybe you do not want to remember
what are you talking about
'course it is none of my business

it is not your taste
what did she say the down payment was
she did not like the other one so she picked this one
she took you shopping for a tie
i had to follow her to a store
that is wrong with your paisley tie
ellie it was a formal party
excuse me  you went to a party with her
i am her bodyguard goddamnit
i know you are her bodyguard  did she buy it or did you
coming to bed
few minutes  want to catch the news
should i wait up  we have got to get up early for the beach tomorrow
mike take it easy
take it easy  i set her up  i saw it coming
it is not your fault  mike please get off the case
it is my fault  i am responsible for her
did you hear what i said
i am sorry  i know i heard noises the detective's wife
c'mon do not make an issue of it do you want the fucking meatloaf or not
d'you have to say fucking every other word
what was that
you heard me
jesus mike somebody's been feeding you a line of crap
you gotta get another tour  we are getting too old for this
i am sorry
what did you do tonight
i watched tv
what did you watch
hey we qualify for the senior citizens earlybird special did you see tommy today  he misses you
well tj's seniority and all  i will talk to garber about it
i already did  i mean i talked to his wife and she talked to him
my wife talks to his wife about what shift i am gonna take
i am going to visit my sister for a few days  i would like you to get your stuff out
what about tommy
he does not want to sleep here  neither do i  it is not my house anymore
i do not know how you did it but whatever it was keep doing it
i just sat and listened
why not patrol  they would do just as good a job
but i got him  he is in jail was not that the point
you apprehended him after he gave himself up 
it was not a bad bust  he gave himself up because he knew i was gonna nab him
anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail
they are operating on him  he is still alive
i heard a lot anything you want to deny mike
what do you think  any chance  there's nothing else i am any good at but this
at my house
let's go  we are taking her home  move it  get the cars
koontz  i need you guys
we will call swat  we will get the locals  throw it
hey mike out of the bag into the bureau huh how do you like it so far
shit  a nursemaid  my first detail and i am a fucking slug  i got a 'choice' at all
do it or look for another profession  that is a choice i guess
you in this with me
not koontz
was not your fault
tell me i am dreaming
uh yeah  i am a policeman
are you in charge here
no sir
i asked for the man in charge
that would be lieutenant garber and he is very busy upstairs
do not tell me he is busy  i asked for an ambulance for this woman and
you are not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer
she is not a suspect sir she is a witness  could i ask you to step outside please
you are here until what time
you made a terrible mistake keegan you did not do what i said
that is right you are gonna do what i say  joey  i want to help you out of this
you should'a brought the girl
hold it
how do i know that is her
i will bring her in  you let them go and i will bring her in
why should she come in
she trusts me  she will do what i say
i want your guarantee they will be turned loose when she opens the front door
i get my hostage first  no one's turned loose until i say so
let my kid go
do not you fucking give orders to me
under the table
watch your step
what are we having
my special scrambled eggs surprise
how do you know where the gun is
i know where everything is
except the goddamn skateboards which are everywhere  i would like to kill the guy who invented those things
lay back mack
god  scrambled eggs surprise these are pickles  god
nice threads dad
how are things going pal
okay i guess
how about dinner tonight
mom and i got plans
what plans  you and mom got plans
she is taking singing lessons
what  what kind of pathetic line is that
we are not going to a singing lesson she is just gonna start taking singing lessons
tommy  the guy's a sleazebag  she cannot sing
i do not think she can sing either
we were under the impression they were being held against their will
my people have a strict policy of noninterference with other cultures in fact it is our prime directive
you have warp capability
i do not like to leave questions unanswered
i know what a hologram is captain the question is  why would someone want to create one of our village
most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down
but not you
there are days
you do not live up to your reputation as an offlander picard
in defense of offlanders there are many more like me
an apprentice for thirty years  we have noticed your people's mental discipline did that develop here
more questions always the explorer if you stay long enough that will change
a perfect moment
when time seemed to stop and you could almost live in that moment
i wish i could spare a few centuries to learn
there's one thing i do not understand  in three hundred yearsyou never learned to swim
i wonder if you are aware of the trust you endanger jeanluc picard in my experience it is unusual for
 an offlander
right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin we can hide for days
that is the rush
there's a cavern at the base of the next hill
mother and son you arranged this
but i have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming i plan on using them
do you really think your mighty federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people
there is no need for concern i am operating within normal parameters now
you are what
my father told me i should not talk to you
i understand
i aspire to be more than i am
i know why  so people like us will not be afraid of you any more
do not you ever get tired
my power cells continually re charge themselves
do machines ever play
i play the violin and my chess routines are quite advanced
chase me
for what purpose
because you are it and if you tag me then i am it
but i can run much faster than you i am capable of exceeding fortyseven meters per second
data have not you ever just played for fun
androids do not havefun
why not
no one's ever asked me that before
tournel will take you the rest of the way
no i want to stay with you
can he breathe under water
data does not breathe
the artificial lifeform was right
captain the songa hostages declined to be examined i had them confined to quarters
and our people
they all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production probably the result of the environmental anomalies here
you either need a new uniform or a new neck
'yewcheen cheffaw' my collar size is exactly the same as it was at the academy
very funny
prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship
will he live
she is stabilizing
is it safe to move her
hello data
captain geordi
yes that looks like them
that is the last thing you remember data
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl'
i believe the boy is afraid of me
it is nothing personal data you have to remember these people have rejected technology and you
 i am the personification of everything they have rejected
until this week that young man probably never saw a  machine let alone one that walks and talks
tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills
a ship
it is clearly federation in origin captain
incomplete i might add
 it is conceivable i was shot to protect the secret of its existence
why would the federation or the songa wish to move the ba'ku
captain i have activated transport inhibitors around the village
how many
i am showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation captain
will the structure hold if we blast through
your federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be
our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk
take us into a high orbit  lie down admiral the girls will take twenty years off your face
your selfrestraint puzzles me admiral you continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer
it is not safe for you to remain in this area
take me down let me talk to picard
talk we should send down an assault team and take them by force
i will order riker to turn around
you are not going to launch anything until
we are taking this ship out of here this mission is over
it is not over
i do not take orders from you
you have no idea what precipitated his behavior
 and now he is holding our people hostage down there
the enterprise can be at your position in two days admiral
that is probably not a good idea your ship has not been fitted for this region there are environmental concerns
captain i was not expecting you
you are not finished here
you are looking well jeanluc rested
i am acting on orders form the federation council
delay the procedure let my people look at the technology
our best scientific minds already have we cannot find any other way to do this
we are only moving six hundred people jeanluc
i wonder which one of us will be facing that courtmartial
a coward without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity you offend me
is this how a federation officer begs for his life
what you are asking me to do is impossible the crew is loyal to ru'afo
do you know how to disable the injector
but i would need at least three minutes on the bridge
the countdown control has been transferred to the collectori cannot override
gallatin so the righteous starfleet captain finally released you did you encounter any problems on the surface
admiral dougherty will not be joining us for diner deploy the collector  do you have a problem with those orders
may i talk to you alone
separate the starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold see that picard joins them
the shields in that section will not protect them against the thermolytic reaction
they are in opposite directions sir
we are about to lose communications with starfleet captain
the torque sensors are out of alignment by twelve microns you could hear that
i took these out of data's neural net they contain memory engrams
do you know how they were damaged
by a songa weapon  there's no doubt about it sir that is what made data malfunction
the songa reports claim they did not fire until after he malfunctioned
i do not believe it happened that way
why would they fire at him without provocation
his ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions
implants bothering you
a photon torpedo  is not that the universal greeting when communications are down
full impulse
the manifold cannot handle full impulse in the patch commander
if we do not outrun them the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship
will that stop the tear
you got me commander
aye sir highly volatilei recommend we keep our distance
negative i want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can
i would not be surprised if history remembers this as the riker maneuver
i do not think they believe us
sir they have detonated an isolytic burst a subspace tear is forming
the tear is closing on us impact in fifteen seconds
the purpose being i intend to shove it down the songa's throat
commander if one of their weapons hits that gas
commander i am showing two songa ships on an intercept course
how long until they reach us
that is inside that nebula cluster
cometary debris pockets of unstable metreon gas we do not want to go in there sir
i thought subspace weapons were banned by the khitomer accord
we are still thirtysix minutes from transmission range sir
they are powering their forward weapons array
they need us to mediate some territorial dispute
we cannot delay the archaeological expedition to hanoran two it would put us into the middle of monsoon season
the diplomatic corps is busy with dominion negotiations
'yewcheen cheffaw'
who is it
 and gorgonzolla cheese
we will not be able to go any faster than onethird impulse in that muck
nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey
so where are the 'environmental concerns' the admiral was talking about
admiral dougherty wants to know why we have not left yet
deck five
prepare the ship for departure at ohsevenhundred hours
you must be planning on doing some hunting
the council has ordered a halt to the ba'ku relocation while they conduct a toplevel review
my name is sojef captain
jeanluc picard my officers doctor crusher and counselor troi
would you like something to eat
no we are here to rescue them
you have not aged a day since then
i wish there was a way to bring them back home
ask them
bridge to captain picard we are approaching sector fourfourone
i i must have slept through my alarm i am on my way
worf to picard
yes yes i can hear you
worf you must hurry
we are coming as fast as we can we cannot risk using phasers
sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface
transmit a wide band covariant signal that will get his attention
he might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach
direct hit he is resetting his shield harmonics
he is activated a transport inhibitor
scanners are off line
do you know gilbert and sullivan
sir inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance if we do not release him he may destroy both vessels
the damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire
did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings
no sir
debrief them again  have you been in a fight commander
doctor crusher asked to talk to you when you returned
should i distribute phasers to the ba'ku sir
you need a haircut commander
isolinear tags their transporters can lock onto them
all injector subsystems are confirmed offline
one it is ru'afo
can you beam him off
negative he is established a security field around the control room
 population three hundred million
say the greeting again
oh my god are they vegetarians that is not in here
why was data assigned
i do not see anything to suggest the songa have any interest in sociology
what are they interested in
wine women and song
nomadic collectors of precious metals jewels
hmm i should feel right at home with them
why would we be involved with these people
what you are doing to my neck
it says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the songa from procreating
no children
come in  hi
got a minute i need a little counseling  first time for everything do i lie down or what
this is not one of the usual therapeutic postures
but it is comfortable
why do not you try sitting up
or you could try lying down
both  i think i am having a midlife crisis
 i believe you
 i am not sleeping well
all hands battle stations
initiate launch sequence
exactly as the simulations predicted
sir i am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels
your scanners must be malfunctioning
this ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters are they all useless
they must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here
good hunting hayes out
we are fine sir it will take some time to explain
montana  energize
go where hello is anyone going to tell me what we are doing here
we are here to find zephram cochrane he may be injured or dead
it is not the radiation and there's nothing wrong with the combadges the enterprise just is not responding
jeanluc this man needs medical attention now
what are we waiting for let's go
it may not be that simple this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history
there must be some good people even in this time
he is stable for now  but it would be better if we could contact our friends
yes but until then you will have to make do with what you have got
i have to go back to the silo will you be all right
you actually performed surgery
not yet
you think they are still up there
if they are not we would better get used to living in montana
regardless of how i may feel about ruby our fates lie along different paths nothing can change that
you want some advice do not do this again  you know exactly what i mean
how long has he been unconscious
is it japanese
um yeah  now he is going to need a respirator do you have one
his automatic reflexes are fluctuating we have got to get him on a respirator
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg
have you ever wondered what it is like to have flesh
you have taken your first step toward perfection how does it feel
i do not know what you are referring to
do you know what this is data
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endoskeletal structure
no i will not betray my friends
they are not your friends they have held you back kept you from your destiny
that is not true they have tried to help me
have they given you what i have given you did they even try
you are becoming more human all the time data now you are learning how to lie
i wish to go back to the way i was
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things
i am grateful for what you have given me but i still do not wish to be assimilated
i have deactivated the sensory inputs that flesh on your body is just meat now
is not it better like this
yes but the enterprise my duty
no no it is so empty please give it back i need it
can you configure it
i believe so
dispersive armor is holding
the borg ship has modified its shields captain our phasers will no longer be effective
we are approaching the terran system captain
go to impulse where is the borg ship
i have helm control
the vortex is collapsing sir
what year is it
mister data i want to know the exact date and time  give me a damage report on that missile silo
who are you
i am the borg
that is a contradiction the borg act as a collective consciousness there are no individuals
the planet's surface is covered with borg technology  so is the moon and three other planets in this solar system
did you know her
data are you sure you are all right
no human beings do not have that luxury and neither should i
apr cell count what the hell are you talking about
where is the battery room for the hospital
what did you do to the batteries
i have the silo sir bearing three one zero distance three hundred meters
this must be it
how serious is the damage
i am having trouble scanning underground there's a lot of radiation leaking from something
i am picking up faint life signs twenty meters below
alphanumeric lock we need a password to get in
blast door it is designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched
picard to enterprise  enterprise please respond
can you reconstruct the throttle valve
yeah if i knew what it looked like there's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this
ready to make a little history
always am
we cannot leave her out there when the ship launches she will be killed
tell her to go back to resurrection
no the door's too thick
then we will just have to assume it is still there
that is still there
solid rocket fuel at twentyfive thousand kilograms
altitude fifty kilometers
entering the upper ionospere
there's a red light on the second intake valve
ready to deploy the warp nacelles
bring the warp core online i will lay in a heading
passing onehalf light speed the starboard nacelle's running a little hot
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating i do not think cochrane built this thing for comfort
there's no temporal shielding in here we are starting to pick up relativistic effects
captain the enterprise
their com system must still be down
they are getting awfully close what the hell are they doing
are we on schedule the vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours
it will be tight but we should make it
what about our warp signature it has to be strong enough for them to detect
i have enhanced the plasma injectors  do not worry they will see it
oh  yes ultraviolet protection thank you mister
lieutenant actually lieutenant jonathan scrimm i am the head of the resurrection protective force  and you are
jeanluc picard
where in the states
oh here and there you know how it is
where are you from most recently
california san francisco
beautiful city used to be anyway i did not think anyone still lived there
that was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries how would you do it
and what were you doing out at the missile silo
i am an old friend of cochrane's i wanted to see how he was doing
you seem to have an answer for everything
something wrong with that
what do you want
there is no invasion
from another planet  oh i almost forgot they have green blood and pointed ears
and you know all this because uyou areu a spaceman too
take care of him he is a very special man
what are you an idiot did not you see the red light was on
ah yes but i did not realize that 
money so you can get dome money
no but sometimes i feel that way  what i meant was i would be willing to trade for the photographs
trade okay the photographs for a straight answer  who are you and how do you know zephram
i am an old friend i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in 
you are lying
what makes you say that
you are not someone who lies very easily so it is obvious when you do at least to me
were the two of you involved
no not like you and doctor crusher used to be
ruby i need to talk to you about those photographs it is very important
i am sure it is but it will have to wait until tomorrow
it cannot wait until tomorrow
i would say you already have
myself and a few other friends of zephram's
all right truth i believe that one why is it so urgent you could not wait until morning
you are leaving are not you
i have to
where and do not tell me san francisco
no it is a lot further than that
it is the future is not it just like you told scrimm  i knew you were not from around here
no i am from france
i do not care if you are from france or venus just take me with you
signal the endeavor to fall back we will cover them
incoming transmission from the borg
life signs
track their weapons fire
time travel they are attempting time travel  full power mister data worf quantum torpedoes at my command
captain there are five borg ships closing in on our position
hull integrity down to thirty percent
captain i have found the borg sphere it is on the far side of the planetfiring at the surface
intercept course full impulse  weapons status
phasers are offline we have two quantum torpedoes left but the computer targeting system has been destroyed
worf have doctor crusher mister la forge and a security team meet me in transporter room three civilian clothes
we are caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex
they must have done it in the past they went back and changed history
we are still in earth orbit
looks like they damaged the silo
life signs
good luck sir
return to our own time
yes sir
yes sir but captain are we all going back
unless you would like to stay
casualties are light captain minor buckling on the port nacelle nothing serious
what the hell is happening worf
we saw at least thirtyand there are twentytwo enterprise crewmembers reported missing including commander data
what are they doing
they are rerouting the deflector power conduits
they are connecting the conduits to subspace communications
we have to stop them from sending that message
agreed options
i guess i would better get it right the first time
are you alright
just a little queasy
and commander whatever you do do unotu vomit in your exosuit it would be unpleasant
we have lost bridge control
wil data was down there
all right we have lost control of eight decks three cargo bays one shuttlebay
they are bypassing engineering
to do what if they wanted a weapon they could have taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay
i remember it made me sick
what are you suggesting
i have to admit there was a moment there when 
worf to bridge
riker here
worf to bridge we are about to enter the environmental control room
worf is something wrong
what the hell happened down there worf
are we in any danger of being detected by earth defense systems
even data
they may be trying to send a message to the other borgthe borg in this time period
mr president
admiral donaldbill
mr president we cannot allow federation citizens to be abducted
i would prefer not to be the president to push the button if i can avoid it
the longer we wait the less accessible the hostages will be mr president
good luck captain
i believe the operation is over
i am going to perform surgery on a torpedo  you never know
bet you wish you would stood in bed
spock that was actually funny
calm yourself doctor the operation is almost complete
pity they are retiring us just as i was starting to understand you spock
or not to be 
uh jim
what the hell's going on
sweet jesus he is lost a lot of whatever this stuff is
can you  
bones why do not you see what you can do let them know we are not holding a grudge
three months till retirement what a way to finish
we are not finished
 ukobayashi maruu
bones are you afraid of the future
that was the general idea i intended to convey
i did not mean this future
are we playing multiple choice
some people are afraid of the future of what might happen  i was frightened really frightened
well do not be too hard on yourself  we all felt exactly the same 
uh uh somebody felt much worse and i am starting to understand why
what is it with you anyway
still think we are finished
what kind of creature is this last night you two were spooning 
jim leave me  i am finished
it is the viridium patch spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard gorkongs ship
that cunning little vulcan
once we are beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away
if they are even looking for us
damned clever if you ask me
absolutely not
time we got underway ourselves gentlemen  once again we have saved civilization as we know it
and the good news is they are not going to prosecute
perhaps with a few small steps at a time like this one
we are explorers not diplomats
this is fun
too bad we cannot smell her
they do not arrest people for having feelings
are you carrying a surgeon
we were until your torpedoes
doctor mccoy what is your current medical status
i did not have the knowledge of klingon anatomy i needed
i was nervous 
i do not believe we can get more out of the way than this
they will make it look like an accident
what are you in for if you do not mind me asking
they will respect him now
i have always wanted to meet you captain
would you care to go topside
to be or not to be that is the question which preoccupies our people captain kirk we need breathing room
my god what happened here
you feign ignorance
he is a doctor
he just tried to save him
there were no other ships in the sector
did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night
i checked the data banks yes
and what did they tell you
louder please we cannot hear you
for insubordination
i have on occasion disobeyed orders
you deny enterprise fired on kronos one
well i 
you deny that your men beamed aboard kronos one and shot the chancellor
i am
as captain i am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command
where is mr sulu
captain you are not going to show them the bridge
just the size of my head 
torpedo room
captain if they fire at us with our shields down 
from starfleet
where is the conference
she is here  somewhere
shields battle stations
mr chekov take us forward thrusters only one half impulse power
mr chekov slow down take us forward thrusters only one quarter impulse power
course heading captain
they are preparing to fire
what are we searching for mr spock
klingon blood
they must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here
this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory
now we go to starfleet
now we expand our search to include uniforms
you must have cursed yourself for having programmed our data banks lieutenant only they revealed something wrong aboard enterprise
aye sir
an incident
do we report this sir
send to commander enterprise we stand ready to assist you captain sulu uss excelsior attach our coordinates
this is kronos one i am chancellor gorkon
chancellor we have been ordered to escort you through federation space to your meeting place on earth
we would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation
we will make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours
your research laboratory is most impressive
thank you captain kirk the evening has been most edifying
i have heard of chameloids  shapeshifters  i thought you were mythical
an accident was not good enough
your friends are late
is not it about time you became something else
what took you so long
kill him he is the one
he wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens
he is got it
and your coat
fraid not it would not fit him anyway
how did you know
we do not get many presidential assassins
we did not kill gorkon
how much time's left of your sentence
that is not his knee  not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place captain
when whoever it is makes their move you will not be here to ask if he is the one
listen no one has ever escaped from rura penthe
except us
i know how to get outside the shield
i cannot make it alone you are the likeliest candidate to come to this godforsaken place in months
stand down your weapons
captain if 
stand down mr scott all stop that is an order
this is incredible 
as you were lieutenant
aft thrusters 
thank you lieutenant one quarter impulse power
aye sir
plot a course for kronos lieutenant
kronos sir
i am still in the chair lieutenant
come on saavik you could knock 
i gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment i do not think many on board are
you piloted well out of spacedock lieutenant 
i always wanted to try that
uhura hailing frequencies right standard rudder bring us alongside
captain our shields  
who is us
just the prototype
standing by captain kirk
you understand that by even talking to us you are violating regulations captain
i am sorry captain  your message is breaking up
bless you sulu  where is the peace conference they are going to attempt another assassination
when does this conference start
according to my information today
thank you captain sulu
i have personally vouched for you in this matter captain
we volunteered
there's an old vulcan proverb only nixon could go to china
how could you vouch for me that is   arrogant presumption 
jim there is an historic opportunity here 
do not trust them do not believe them 
they are dying
never been this close
i believe the captain feels that starfleet's mission has always been one of peace 
i do not believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy
what is it
i am uncertain
spock i am really tired
curiously it appears to emanate from us
what the 
we have not fired 
the klingons have a new weapon a bird of prey that can fire while cloaked she torpedoed gorkongs ship
the peace conference
i have been dead before uhura raise excelsior she ought to have the coordinates
why would they give them to us
are you dining on worms
i was blind i could not see past the death of my son i could not trust
i was prejuduced by those achievements
i should have been 
not for the actions of another no one is responsible for any actions but his own human beings 
but i am not human i am only 
close enough to beam down
that is she waiting for
the only way to find out if a mangs trustworthy
control tower reading sir
channel open captain
we surrender
it is pretty chaotic over there there's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting
gorkongs own man
captain we cannot see her but she gives off heat
her own father
any reply from starfleet to our dispatch lieutenant
not as yet sir
curious you have not been assisting commander uhura with her radio transmissions have you lt
commander uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir
very well for twentyfour hours we will agree that this conversation did not take place
a lie
a lie
if you are logical
i do not want to
but it was when you tried to persuade me the captain was guilty that i should have understood
direct hit 
apparently they are refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock sir
you having hearing problems mister
according to this we have completed our exploration of the entire sector
fiftyfour planets  and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies our sensing and analytic equipment worked well
i have confirmed the location sir but
what is it
at least we must keep track of where they are taken sir i 
no way
it is as i said mr spock inventory still registers every torpedo
yet the data banks insist we fired twice one computer is lying
a computer canna lie sir
i think  not
you can check the torpedoes visually if you like 
we will have to check every one of them mr scott
and if they are still in place
twentyfour hours from now we will not have a clue where the captain is
they dinna fire on themselves and there were no other ships present
there was an enormous neutron energy surge
too far off very near us perhaps underneath us
if another ship had been beneath us the klingons would have seen her
a bird of prey canna fire when she is cloaked
this one can
they you are talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction mr spock
they are outside the beaming shield mr scott start your engines
they are naturally wary ma'am we have been at war a long time
sulu's giving us his position and telling us he is standing by
an ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains  however improbable  must be the truth
what exactly does that mean
and they would be right we have no evidence  just a theory that happens to fit the facts
i have pulled out my  uh wooden shoe and starfleet is screaming for us to return to port
i do not think starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament
they might as well arrest me too i felt like lieutenant saavik
was this him
um he was older
besides that
does koessler know about the suspect zero theory
welcome back sir how was the vacation
agent duncan there's an interstate issue up on 54 run out there
agents duncan mackelway  anything new

dylan here
sheriff dylan this is fbi agent thomas mackelway remember me

i want to talk about the karen sumpter case
you have the body
she is buried
i am sorry this will not take long
the body was embalmed i do not understand 
turn the body over there was something in the autopsy report yes here  these burn marks
a grill pattern
i am not in the mood for native american wisdom
be my guest agent kulok scrub suits are in the back
there seems to be a discrepancy
not a discrepancy an error my capacity is 55 tons not 6
i have 6 tons
mam it is my truck i know my own capacity
you cannot imagine how many men have told me that
it is been customized for sleeping capacity
oh yes i see you must get asked this a lot
you surprised me
sorry i have seen you in here always lugging that case around  whatja sell
ah restaurant supplies i did not get your name
whole country or just hereabouts
i do not mean to be rude but
you must get lonely you ever think about you know 
excuse me
what are you
look mister
my god
not bad huh
you are a you are sick
oh god mister please leave me alone
you are going to miss it pay attention
i have been looking for you
what did he look like
i did not wait on him fifty or so white regular build needed a shave  that is all i remember
how did you know he was a construction worker
he was sitting here
there was a car in the lot when we closed gone today
what about his killer
nada vague description that is all finetoothcombed speck's car the diner no fingerprints no trace evidence
you have the photo from the diner
at the field office
he said it was a clue
chuck hello  this is agent kulok she has a background in medical forensics
maybe cause he is smart
we have another one
another what
deputy director get out sir
speck harold speck
i will relay this to ciiac
i had gotten their trust we were sharing fantasies i could not risk it
its called insubordination
how do you feel agent
pretty embarrassed to be honest i had him
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard
he got away i had him he got away
do you think he singled you out
the cut on your arm  mind if we remove the bandage
you did not like anyone looking over your shoulder  why was that what were you doing
i will take it into consideration
you feeling okay agent mackelway
had trouble sleeping last night sir
nothing concrete nothing i would well nothing
i do not believe this
i am hesitant to
you knew the arm slash was not zorro
i suspected but you were the one low contacted that is why i brought you back here
we are waiting for trace evidence results on the rice killing
we need to put out an ncic inquiry
how do you send out an apb on a dead man
why did you go to chicago
i was visiting an old college friend
i was looking for a pattern
that breaks my confidentiality stipulation
i did not use low's name
there was talk of a file photo
i understand
he is got you believing in zero now too
i need to get to amarillo immediately
have you told richard low about amarillo
i cannot the chat room is not open for another five days
we will wait get online with low inform him of zero's route  we will set a trap for him
what about zero darryl hawkins
hawkins is not the target richard low's the target
there's a killer out there  we know who he is he could be stalking now
miss me dave
do not you touch him
you better hope the director does not stop abruptly one day david you might break your nose
you are so fucked up
thanks for the ride
they sort of got me on shit detail no offense
you used to be in the behavioral science unit right
how long have you been downtown
you work with koessler
not especially
why did he come out here that is going on
and who kills in the manner of his victim
that informationgs being withheld from the media
some kids found you in a garbage dump
yes i do
relax  j edgar's greatest fear a female with a badge
the man knew how to dress
that is part of the reason i dropped by i need to learn this stuff
the other reason
gone live
chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims i went live last month
you got a point there
i was interested in two things computers and crime they sort of came together
and one other thing
look at this fellow or this one
grown man dressed like a clown does he really think he looks good
he thinks he looks young
me too  make any headway with zorro
none cannot find a thing nothing on file nothing online it is not a part of any known killer's signature
i ever get like that just take me out in back and shoot me
you must really think i am a square a computer nerd
why did koessler assign you as my liaison
because you asked him to stupid
there are agency regulations about this
intraagency fraternizing
it is a nono
i know
i have been thinking about this
does koessler ask about me
he is called a couple times
what did you tell him
just routine stuff
not about coming to see daitz
we got an unsub walking around with four feet
the tattoo
sue ann hanson
did they disconnect testa's computer
maybe we should back off a bit
i cannot they trust me they accept me i have got their confidence
that is true
then there's the other issue
that is that
you need time to think about the case about you and me
i found a peephole into deviant world i am gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out
and nobody else can do that
do not confuse what we do with who we are
jaime where are you
where are you everybody's looking for you
that is up
my watch he toyed with me he sent me to chicago
you want to get him find something he wants get him to come to you
start killing people for real
suspect zero
this feels like something out of a spy novel
i guess i am a little paranoid
slow down a second you met with low 
you were right he found me
does one exist
probably i told him koessler had ordered the report kept it secret
it is okay to be wrong just do not be dead wrong
they say richard low is wrong but because of him women innocent women are alive who would be dead
tom you okay
hardly anyone calls me tom everybody calls me mack i always liked that
you okay
yeah of course
all the same killer
low calls him suspect zero
suspect zero is a crackpot theory you said so
what happened
unlock these cuffs
mack must think zero has a police band
uncuff me that is wrong with you do not you want to save the boy
okay i will unhook you no weapon
no weapon
bitch cunt please please please do not do this agent kulok you need me
how did you know speck was a killer
who are you
yes sir
dave koessler must have you jumping through hoops
i believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops
how is the arm
i have been reading hearing about you i spoke to koessler professor daitz
he could not break an egg with a hammer he still writing those crime porn books
i do not carry it with me
you are a smart guy tell me what it says
how do you know who's real and who's not
and who else did i find agent thomas mackelway crackerjack fbi techie i was greatly disappointed when you were reassigned
it was the mall
i know you lionheart i watched your mind work heard your dirty thoughts 
you you went by the book
[fantasy time girls give it up give it up]

i do not think you understand
what is it exactly i do not understand agent mackelway
deputy director koessler does not want zero all he cares about is low
it is over for you
you have to put things in perspective
i know i know
you have been through worse
you are right i know
ever since i have known you
i do not know about that
moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this
okay i will think about that bye

i am mike
hi mike i am lorraine
like the quiche
yes like the quiche
i like quiche
i thought real men do not like quiche
my reputation seems to have preceded me
why you are not a real man
so i thought what the hell they make movies in la not in michigan so i moved here
just like that
well it was not the simple but yeah
how was it hard
well i left someone very special behind
tell me about it
i thought i was going to die
it is been six months and i am just starting to get over it
oh god that is two more than me tell me it gets better
well it still sucks but you start to see that there are advantages to being single
like what
what else
what else let's see you have complete freedom
to do what
like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance i can do that
uh if the guy wants to
charles that is up man
oh you know
and boy does it hurt when they ask
i do not even tell them about anything i am close on anymore
not until you book it
and even then
they are out of glenlivet
oh i am sorry how would your folks take it
i have not heard an official no yet
i am considering taking a job as a goofy
i heard it took four days to light for that shot

could you believe it
wait here i will get you that martini
nah i did not really want it anyway i just wanted to order it
can i get you something else i mean you should not leave without getting something for free
what do you guys do
you have to lay it on the table
you want this in black chips
you should a lot of comics play vegas
well i am afraid it is not that easy
why not
there are different circuits it is hard to explain you would not understand
who's your booking agent
oh you know about booking agents i do not uh actually have a west coast agent as of yet
well who represents you back east
actually it is funny you i am actually uh between
i know but she did she is with someone else now
already you poor thing it will not last
why not
it is a rebound
we were a rebound and we lasted six years

you are a comedian
yeah and an actor
i will have to come see you sometime
if and when i get a real gig i will call you

yeah but entertainment law is not something you just jump into
neither is acting not if you are serious about it  can i have one of these
why you like the duck with the cigar 
yeah nice touch it is the logo from you bet your life right
good eye not one club owner got it they all ask me why i got donald duck on my card

i miss you mike
the michelin commercial
yeah with the baby in the tire one time i started to cry right in front of pierre
and what if i do not want to give up on her
you do not call
well that sucks
right or more likely the opposite
right wait what do you mean
i mean first you will pretend not to care not call  whatever and then eventually you really will not care
unless she comes back first
ah see that is the thing somehow they do not come back until you really do not care anymore
there's the rub
there's the rub
thanks man sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time
hey man do not sweat it
it is just that you have been there your advice really helps
no problem
rob i just want you to know you are the only one i can talk to about her
i do not think i am gonna take it
it is a gig

i suspected as much
you need not worry it is over and done with a long time ago
annie  there's nothing between mitch and me
is not there  maybe there is not maybe there's never anything between mitch and any girl
when was this
with lydia  did she seem a trifle distant
then why did she object to you
because she was afraid
afraid you would take mitch
afraid i would give mitch
i do not understand
afraid of any woman who would give mitch the only thing lydia can give him  love
someone ought to tell her she would be gaining a daughter
she already has a daughter
then what are you doing here in bodega bay
you get straight to the point do not you
he wants me to go to cathy's party tomorrow afternoon  i said i would
i will be going too to help out it should be fun melanie

whose side are you on
i am simply quoting the law
she is a charming girl is not she mitch
yes very
how long have you known her
i told you we met yesterday
she was selling birds
no i only led her into believing i believed she was mother it is really very complicated
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
i know mother
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer is not she
i know mother
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself
well  so long as you know what you want mitch
well well is everyone all right
tell him about the party
did you you get the windows in the attic mitch
i got them all mother
when do you think they will come
i do not know
if there are larger birds mitch they will get into the house
that is a chance we have to take
maybe we ought to leave
i do not know when  we will see what
where will we go
i do not know yet  i think we will be safe here  let's bring that wood in
i do not know we will break up the furni
mother i am trying my best  i am trying my
mother get a rope
oh my god look at her
i can handle it
i am not very good at this mitch
you are doing fine
they are gone the same pattern
but they will be back
we will not be here
where can we go mitch there's no place to go
i want to try for san francisco there are buildings there steel and concrete
we would never make it they are probably all over the road
we have to try it  we cannot stay here  melanie needs help  mother the house will not take another attack
if  if when we get to san francisco  if they are already there
they will not be
if they are
we will worry about that when we get there
i started to say inside
then you knew mitch in san francisco is that right
if i go across to santa rosa i will come onto the freeway much earlier
no it is me mrs brenner i thought you might like some tea
where is mitch
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm
why did not al believe my story
he was calling from the farm mrs brenner
then he saw
he must have he sent for the santa rosa police
yes i am sure she is fine
try not to think of that mrs brenner
is that so important mrs brenner you liking me
yes i think so my son is important to me i want to like any girl he chooses
and if you do not
then i do not suppose it will matter much to anyone but me
would you like me to go for her
i could not ask you to
i do not mind really
would you i would feel so much better
that is the last of it
did you close the door
please do not mess me up with bandages mrs brenner
that is a chimney swift all right
well these birds live in chimneys you know
not by the thousands
no i gotta admit this is peculiar  did you have a light burning or something
yes but the curtains were drawn
'cause sometimes birds are attracted by light you know  sure is a peculiar thing
what are we going to do about it al
i do not think i get you mitch do about what
my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once
did not know how he got in there had a broken leg turned out just fluttering all around there 
well if there's anything else i can do mitch
thanks al we will be all right
he was killed last night by birds
there's an ordinance against burning anything in this town unless it is
he is not home
yes i do not think you should leave them in the hall do you
well where did he go
bodega bay he goes up there every weekend
bodega bay where is that
up on the coast about sixty miles north of here
sixty  oh
i would hold the birds for him but i am going away myself someone's got to feed them i suppose
yes yes someone's got to feed them
lovebirds sir
yes i understand there are different varieties it that true
i understand completely sir
as the same time i would not want birds that were aloof either
no of course not
do you have a pair that are just friendly
i think so sir  now then let me see
are not these lovebirds
no sir those are redbirds
the sign says strawberry finches
yes we call them that too  ahhh here we are lovebirds 
those are canaries miss  does not this make you feel awful
does not what make me
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this
well we cannot just let them fly around the shop you know
i suppose not is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages
oh certainly it is to protect the species
i imagine that is very important especially during the moulting season
yes that is a particularly dangerous time
are they moulting now
some of them are
how can you tell
yes i see  about those lovebirds miss
are you sure you would not like to see a canary instead we have some very nice canaries this week
what did you say
i was merely drawing a parallel miss daniels
but how how do you know my name
a little birdie told me  good day miss daniels  madam 
i do not know you
we met in court
we never met in court or anyplace else
do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window
i did not break that window
no but your little prank did the judge should have put you behind bars
what are you a policeman
i simply believe in the law miss daniels and i am not too keen on practical jokers
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical
ahhh but i really do want those birds
i think you are a louse
i am  good day  madam 
and i am glad you did not get your lovebirds
that was the damndest thing i ever saw
what made it
that is that
so you are a lawyer
that is right what are you doing in bodega bay
do you practice here
no san francisco what are you
is that why you would like to see everyone behind bars
not everyone miss daniels
i am sorry  what are you doing up here
did not you see the lovebirds
you came all the way up here to bring me those birds
to bring your sister those birds you said it was her birthday besides i was coming up anyway
what for
to see a friend of mine  will you please be careful
annie annie hayworth
how do you know annie
we we went to school together college
did you imagine that how long will you be staying
just a few just a day or two the weekend
i think we will have to shave the hair deke have you got a razor
oh no you do not
i do not believe you  i think you came up to see me
what did it say
cannot see a thing
i cannot say i like your seagulls much either i come all the way up here to
but you were coming up anyway remember
i was and all i get for my pains is a a a hole in the head
right next to the one you already had
after all you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds
yes but
you are are not you
certainly but
with with annie of course
of course how stupid of me a quarter to seven will that be all right
annie annie may have made other plans i will have to see besides i can find my own way
you are sure now you will not hire a boat or anything
i am sure
why did he shoot her
you will be able to find your way back will not you
oh yes
will i be seeing you again
how does mother know what i like to do
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns
oh that rome
mmmm i like to swim we might get along very
in case you are interested i was pushed into that fountain
you were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh
i am neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd
yes but
the opinions of others and you went right along with them is not that the truth
yes that is the truth but i was pushed into that fountain and that is the truth too
sure do you really know annie hayworth
no  at least i did not until i came up here
you were lying
yes i was lying
did you really write a letter to me or was that a lie too
i wrote the letter
because it seemed stupid and foolish
like jumping into a fountain in rome
i told you what happened in rome
do you expect me to believe
that might have been good enough in rome last summer but it is not good enough now
it is for me
but not for me
what do you want 
that is in this nitroglycerin
why do you have to rush off that is so important in san francisco
well i have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing
you have a job
i have several jobs
what do you do
i do different things on different days
like what
on mondays and wednesdays i work for the travelers' aid at the airport
and fridays what do you do then
nothing  i go to bird shops on fridays
i am glad you do
what will it say
you will think me very bold sir
last night what do you mean
a gull smashed into annie's front door  mitch that is happening
i do not know melanie  look do you have to go back to annie's
no i have my things in the car
do you want some mustard with this
some cream
i will take cathy up to bed
are you staying
really tell me about it
it is an uprising
of birds
growing a beard
yes of course he had to have a beard 'birds of the world unite' he kept saying over and over
so they united
not at first oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks
well they will go along with anything
why should we submit ourselves to their domination
hear hear
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages birds of the world unite
take wing
it is so damn quiet out there
it was like that yesterday
what do you mean
after the gulls attacked
i had not thought of that  and then the swifts came
it makes you feel as if they are they are waiting or resting or
melanie melanie
i am frightened mitch
i got here as fast as i could where is cathy
i think it is safe to get out now
do not let's take any chances
the town looks clear
the bay does not
i keep thinking of annie 
it it does not look very different does it a little smoke over the town but otherwise
even the birds sitting out there it does look very much the same mitch this could be last week
do you want to try your father again 
i tried a little while ago the phone's dead
have we still got power
when will they stop
i thought they would have stopped by now
what time is it
almost two am
you must be exhausted
you would have been safe in san francisco
we would better light some of those lamps
mitch if they hear the car starting if they see movement
can we turn back
hello mrs macgruder have you ever seen so many gulls
hello miss daniels
i was hoping you would be a little late miss daniels  you see he has not arrived yet
well this one will not be a chick will he
certainly not oh no certainly not this will be a full grown myna bird full grown
and he will talk
i think maybe you would better deliver him let me give you my address 
i am sure they are on the way though could i just call
there we are
that that who was that
have you got a pencil
they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon if you would care to come back
no you would better send him may i use your phone
yes certainly 
do you have any lovebirds
no not in the shop but i can order them for you
how soon
well well how soon would you want them
immediately  is this the daily news melanie daniels would you get me the city desk please
they are both perching birds of course but of quite different species the crow is brachyrhynchos the blackbird is cyanocephalus
i just came from the school madam i do not know about their brain pans but
hello may i speak to mitch brenner please  yes i will wait
yes all right i will wait for you goodby 
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world
the gulls were after your fish mr sholes really let's be logical about this
what were the crows after at the school
what do you think they were after miss
daniels i think they were after the children
for what purpose
i do not know why
does not it seem odd that they would wait all that time to start a a war against humanity
maybe they are all protecting the species maybe they are tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and
are you discussing gamebirds now all birds are not gamebirds you know
and what vultures hawks eagles
sebastian i am not an alarmist
look mitch even if this is true even if all the birds
do you believe it is true sebastian
no i do not mitch because i cannot see any reason for it
it is happening is not that a good enough reason
i like bodega bay as well as any man if i thought 
then help me sebastian you are an important man in this town if you will help the rest will
help how what do you want to do
i am not sure but
how do you plan to do that
how can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke
scotch light on the water
yeah birds all they do is make a mess of everything who needs them
we need them
not if they are starting a war
then fight back get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth
kill them all get rid of them messy animals
how many gulls did you count mrs bundy
which gulls mr sholes there are several varieties
the ones that have been raising the devil with my fishing boats
actually those gulls must have been after the fish
of course
i am going out that way lady you can follow me
then let's go now
i have not finished my drink
were the santa rosa police at your school today  are you coming
something like this happened in santa cruz last year the town was covered with seagulls
i am leaving are you coming
i hate that picture
where are they
can i get you something a glass of water a transfusion
where are they last chance
around or whatever the hell you are doing here  what are you doing here
how many innocent people did you leave dead back there
it was one thing her dad rejected you but when she did you lost it
you are wrong
tell her we will get him
check and mate
two down two to go
down wait do not tell me
you think i am crazy
what do they do that they had to kill her
i was hoping you would find out
the strip joint
where is it this place
i think we should get some support
that was a fucking hollow point
think maybe knives do
keep that thing away from me
fuck what do you want
a scar on the arm of the man who planted this in alex corvis's car
sssshhh she is resting
you lied at my trial

lauren called me that when we were little daisy no one knew but us
honey it is does not mean anything it is not a message
that guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about lauren

they killed her because she found out
about you
i would never hurt you or lauren never believe me
i do not believe you
please come inside
you should see it professor barnhardt you should go out and see it for yourself
thanks  i am enjoying it right here
the whole city has stopped people are running around like ants
what about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight have they all arrived
i talked to most of them this morning they were all very curious about the meeting
good did you speak to our friend mr carpenter
he will be there at 830
tell me hilda  does all this frighten you  does it make you feel insecure
yes sir  it certainly does
yes  that will reproduce the first order terms but what about the effect of the other terms
almost negligible with variation of parameters this is the answer
i would like to explain something of my mission here
i leave that in your hands
you would have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting
no  not at all
what about your personal safety in the meantime what about the army  and the police
my name is carpenter and i am a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house
i am afraid i cannot offer you any real protection i have no influence in cases of interplanetary conspiracy
i am sure i will be quite safe until the meeting
one thing mr klaatu suppose this group should reject your proposals what is the alternative
such power exists
would such a demonstration be possible before the meeting
that can easily be arranged
i would not want you to harm anybody  or destroy anything
why do not you leave it to me i will think of something
bet he is mom bet he is out looking for that space man
hi mom
did you have a nice day dear
come on bobby time to go to bed
mom  why does mr carpenter have to go down to the police station
we sure had fun today we saw the space ship and we went to see professor barnhardt  and
professor barnhardt
yeah sure mom do i have to go to school tomorrow
of course dear
bobby  i think it would be better if we did not see quite so much of mr carpenter
gee why mom he is my best friend and he is awful good in arithmetic he even helps professor barnhardt
mom  is there something wrong with mr carpenter
what do you mean dear
bobby what are you doing up at this hour
i could not go to sleep mom i had to tell you
bobby you have been dreaming again
yes i have
he gave these to you
gee mom do you think maybe he is a diamond smuggler
oh boy  can i mom
yes dear come on now  bobby your shoes are soaking
are you an fbi man
bobby  who's the greatest man in america today
gee  i do not know the space man i guess
well  professor barnhardt i guess he is the greatest scientist in the world
he lives here in washington does not he
sure right near where my mother works
boy i will bet he is strong i bet he could knock down a whole building
gee i would like to get inside and see how it works what do you think makes it go
well  atomic power i would imagine
i thought that was only for bombs
no it is for a lot of other things too
you think it can go faster than an f 36
maybe four thousand miles an hour and outside the earth's atmosphere a good deal faster
gee how could they make a landing
you think they will ever find him
i do not know bobby i am inclined to doubt it
mr carpenter  what does velocity mean
bobby  i have an idea let's go see professor barnhardt and find out how he talks
you are just kidding are not you
would not you like to meet him
well sure i would but   aw i will bet you would be scared
what does that mean
it is a problem in celestial mechanics
bet he is the only one in the world knows the answer
did all these people die in wars
sure did not you ever hear of arlington cemetery
no  i am afraid not
mr carpenter  you do not seem to know about anything
i will tell you bobby  i have been away for a long time very far away
is it different where you have been  do not they have places like this
go to the movies
all right
no fooling will you
i have got some money my mother gave me two dollars
gee  those look like diamonds
some places that is what people use for money they are easy to carry  and they do not wear out
bet they are worth about a million dollars
would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them
let's not say anything to my mother about this mr carpenter
why not bobby
mrs benson  this is mr brady
we certainly did
aw gee  we did not finish our story
all you have to remember is first find the common denominator  then subtract
thanks mr carpenter
bobby  have you a flashlight
what do you want it for mr carpenter
oh i would say fortyfive
he told me this morning when i examined him he is seventyeight
i do not believe it
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty
just klaatu
the president asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened we all feel
about five months  your months
you must have come a long way
naturally we are very curious to know where it is you come from
it is rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor
i am afraid in the present situation you will have to learn to think that way
the present situation
i mean the reasons for my coming here
we are very curious about that too would you care to talk about it
i would be glad to  not now of course  with you alone
perhaps you would rather discuss it personally with the president
this is not a personal matter mr harley it concerns all the people on your planet
i  i am not sure i understand
i traveled 250 million miles what about your united nations
you must have a rather strange impression of us
perhaps if you could explain a little
then why not a meeting of all the chiefs of state
apparently i am not as cynical about earth's people as you are
good afternoon  i am glad to see you up and around
it is not your government i am thinking about it is your world
our problems are very complex mr klaatu you must not judge us too harshly
i can judge only by what i see
your impatience is quite understandable
i am impatient with stupidity my people have learned to live without it
well we could
it was a wonderful day
you still have not answered my question
you know how i feel tom i just want to think it over
the boss is leaving for chicago tomorrow if i could tell him i was getting married  with two dependents
you are a good salesman  but i have got to think about it
you ready
i will be in just a minute
the picture starts at eightfifty
i was talking to mr carpenter
he is not there  but look what i found in his room
is it real
i wonder if we ought to
bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight
you think it is all right for you to stay here
tom  i have been trying to get you all afternoon
i have got some terrific news about your friend mr carpenter
all right tom  it is true i know it is true
how do you know
never mind about that  you have got to promise me you will not say a word to anybody
are you crazy after what happened today
you do not understand you do not realize how important it is
he is a menace to the whole world it is our duty to turn him in
is that what you are thinking about
you will feel different when you see my picture in the papers
i feel different right now
you wait and see you are going to marry a big hero
i do not know how to thank you
everyone seems so 
bobby's the only person i know who is not  jittery
he has his homework to keep him occupied
he is a fine boy mrs benson
excuse me i was just going up to my room
mr carpenter i  goodnight
oh  hello
may i see you for a minute
i  i was just going to lunch
i want to know what he told you last night
i  i did not really pay much attention  bobby has such an active imagination
what is it you want
what happened
just twelve
we will be stuck here for a little while  about thirty minutes
we could try pushing the other buttons  i have a flashlight in my purse
why not
it must be twelvethirty
i am sure barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting
where is the meeting going to be
it is only a few blocks to barnhardt's
i am worried about gort i am afraid of what he might do  if anything should happen to me
klaatu barada nikto
i  i thought you were
i was
you mean he has the power of life and death
but how  how long
we will miss you very much  bobby and i  he will not have anyone to play with
he will have you  and tom
no that is all finished
how dare you write on that blackboard  do you realize the professor has been working on that problem for weeks
he will catch on to it in no time now
how did you get in here and what do you want
is it worth anything
i have never seen such a stone will you please tell me where it came from
that is what i wanted you to tell me
you sure about that
would you like to sell it
no  no thanks
the professor's secretary says she found you in barnhardt's room making marks on his blackboard
oh i see he was having trouble and you were helping him out
that is right
i suppose you know that barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the army
in this case the secret would not be worth much he does not know the answer himself
but i suppose you know the answer
your name's carpenter  that right  any identification mr carpenter driver's license  social security number
no  i am afraid not
well how do i know who you are
okay  book him and get him fixed up  looks like everybody's going nuts
may i suggest that you call the professor
i do not like horror comics
how do you like santa carla

what clothes
 ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up
palmer you and copper tie everyone down  real tight
what for
you ai not tying me up
then i will have to kill you
we should have jumped his ass
load of bullshit
spaceship of some kind
i think so
not the only one
the fire's got the temperature way up all over camp will not last long though
neither will we
maybe we should try and fix the radio try and get some help
maybe we should not
maybe we should not make it
screw regulations  four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there
my god what in hell happened here
hey sweden
what are you doing
could be important work  might as well bring it back
well who's got access to it
would that test have worked
now hold him

 guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us
nothing we can do about that
yes there is  i would like to go up
goes on like that quite awhile  what do you gentlemen make of it
how long will it take you to prepare this
a couple of hours
can there be some kind of test to find out who's what
i do not see how when i am finished i return it right away

sanchez you and palmer search the inside
what kind of test
tie up clark too
he is dead
how we going to try and find out who's you know who's who
where were the flashlights

that thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes macready
this storm do that
we are going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood
what is it
where was he trying to go
what about childs
you and nauls got to block off the west side bunks the mess hall and the kitchen

so what do you make of it
you know damn well what we both make of it
somebody else sure as hell thought so
we should sleep in shifts
that is happened
it is the generator i think  no power
he is one of them
you hear that
it is in between us and them  how we going to get back
it must have been hard leaving your work
now how did you get hurt
i had an accident
what do you do on the towers
on the towers
ah no
do not tell me you are a mud carrier
 thousands and thousands of people  and sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories
and everyone looks like us
she did not want me to be a climber she wanted me to be a planner like her
how can they just go back to work as if nothing happened
what else can they do
kalen do you have any idea where they take them
no one ever comes here  my mother told me stories about it late at night  they tell all the children
what kind of stories
i had a friend who came here once sort of a dare
what happened
 well you wanted to see it
this is it
yes  just about here
right up your alley i would think you are from the past yes
i must say you look remarkably good  you do not want a book then
what are you
i am the librarian  i have always been the librarian
sir have you a name
you know of them
who does not know the morlocks
but you escaped
i was lucky  the others were not
regenerating fission reactor you would not understand  it is power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity
because you will never die
excuse me
and if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time
when was his mother taken
last night
send him home  you do not want him to see it
my god i saw this
are not you a plucky little  
it is what they want you to see
this is the way in
yes are you sure you want to do this
in for a penny in for a pound  do you know that saying
that is it all for
the air the power
why did they built it
what do you mean
takes a licking but keeps on ticking   for a while anyway
i will not leave you like this
go back to the light  you were not made for this  i was i was made for this moment
i do not understand
now get out of my sight you hideous primate
i will never forget this
i should hope not   alexander make them read my books  tell them who they are who they could be
well alexander as a fellow scientist i know you have a thousand questions 
you came underground when the world was ending above  and you evolved some into the morlocks and others 
you would not understand  we genetically engineered the morlock class to serve our needs
how do you control the morlocks
and what of the eloi
they survived above  became what they are
go back to where you came from  or die here
why would you let me go back
we have lost the capacity to reproduce  but the species must continue
she will not remember you  none of them will  you will be forgotten that is how history works
a man can change his history
that was a foolish thing to do
i could have a hundred morlocks here in thirty seconds
i know
i am tired of running
i do not think that is going to happen
it is spectacular
thanks  old nell's my girl all right  al least when she decides to move stubborn beast
how do you keep the water temperature stable
god  could have killed me  bad girl nell  how did you know to do that
ahhh i am afraid i have got a prior commitment
next time then  we perambulate here most every night
may i help you
i  what are you
i am the fifth avenue public library informational kiosk  vox registration ny114  may i help you
you are late
got here as soon as i could

i need to um talk to you
talk away professor
what  yes  orion  good fortune  sailors
all right what is it now
emma you know i have great admiration for you
admiration  my my
i mean well affection
you know the moment is rather dying here
i know it is not a diamond but 
a moonstone
you are late
got here as soon as i could
dance with me
you know i cannot
alex what is it
i need to talk to you
all right
let's walk through the park
no let's walk through the city
alex what is it
why do we have to race for heavengs sake
my god
you are so pale i hope you are not coming down with something
no i am fine  i am   wonderful  just walking down the street with you again
they are rare   oriongs belt pointing to the earth 
the sailor's omen of good fortune the hunter watching over him on his travels
heavens look at that now
now i know you are ill  passing up the chance to explore some new gadget
alex people are staring
let them
 the point is i know it will work once the um numbers and such are in order
do you know you were humming
i was not
somewhere around d2xy something something
damned if i can keep her out of my equations
tonight's the night
you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers
where is the challenge in that
alex this is your first year as an associate professor  you might want to play things a little more conservatively
i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge
emma actually likes chalk dust  says it smells like me
she made the best shepherd's pie i ever tasted
do you have a romantic bone in your body
i am sorry david
it hurt me alex  very much
you know that is what it is  mrs watchit tells me you are here at all hours  day and night 
that is because i am working  you remember that  you used to care about your work
i live with it every minute of every day
alex nothing will ever change what happened but 
what is it
you would not believe me
i would
i will tell you what come by for dinner in a week and i will show you
why do not you come to our house instead
i cannot do that 
whengs the last time you were outside this house    or this room
that is absurd 
you will not say that in a week
all right  i will come for dinner and in the meantime you will think about what we discussed
good night david
and this would be my study  there was an elm tree outside the window then
this was my home
and your jewelry too  i guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss
did you hear me lad
how long did you travel
is there a lot of illness
your husband is dead
you are not from beyond the valley
you might find the truth rather hard to understand
oh that explains everything
i know it is hard to believe but it is true
that machine 
allowed me to travel from my time to yours
how long ago
why not
is he all right
i am going to sit with kalen  keep the fire burning if you can
i will take you to your machine tomorrow
you seem fascinated by the stars
you can see so many here
do not then have stars where you come from
good night then
we all have that dream
all of you
every night
you share dreams  that is incredible
this is magnificent
thank you
the mud carriers
i can see kalengs point
it is not supposed to be easy it is supposed to be beautiful
that is it all for
i do not understand
i mean why do you do it  what purpose does it serve
it has no purpose  it is just beautiful does everything have a purpose where you come from
what are you
i am a planner  i help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like
 it was a great city  the greatest city in the world
learning was important
oh very  learning commerce the arts  the whole place was buzzing all the time  night and day
it must have been safe
oh it was   most of the time
it sounds like a wonderful place to live
those rocks over there they are the same this is central park
this is where my journey started right here
someone you loved very much
yes after her death it was intolerable for me here the future had to be better
is it
good  it looks fine  we had quite a ride together
it is undamaged
yes a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship shape
so you can use it now
yes i suppose so
go back to your own time
mara  what  
oh huzzah the master's home
do you have it
now that is more like it  you look a proper gentlemen for once
then if emma turns me down will you marry me
oh i am already swooning
yes sir he 
all right mrs watchit  you can go
may i get you some 
i see
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is applied mathematics and engineering am i correct
imagine that
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum
well perhaps i have deviated the tiniest bit
might i ask why
my equations are not parlortricks
abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical durations  even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point
yes sir
and hungry i would say  you had such a long journey
i did
what are your people called
well i guess you would call us new yorkers
he said he traveled for two months
to live in  there's a lot of us beyond the valley
i am the oldest
no i mean someone considerably older  your father perhaps
my father has gone to a better place
i am sorry i did not mean to
good morning alexander  feeling up to some work
where do they take them
we do not know
we have to go after them find where  
alexander i know you are trying to help  but they do not come back
what do you mean
they have gone to a better place
you know that is not true
this is out life alexander  it is a hard life but it is how we have always lived
then it is time to change that 
you will not even try
my fowl have polluted the yard
sir if i may 
yes sir
i found you  i saved your life you were bleeding all over the place
what did you do at night
we will see about that
i want to see your home  will you take me
kalen right now you need to go up to bed  you are exhausting alexander
kalen it is all right i am here 
they are here  they are inside the house  
no you are safe 
hello mrs watchit  you are looking in the pink
i wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she is in for
i do not know what to tell you sir he is been gone this whole week
and you have no idea where he went
you ok
i am fine
[beat] listen i hate to bother you
then do not
but what about starks
what about starks
should we be
should we be what trying to change him any way we can [beat] yes
we never should have done this to him
well your conditiongs pretty serious
[beat] so they say [off becker's steady gaze] what
i am just looking at you does that make you uncomfortable
you said you could not remember killing officer harrison correct
[beat] you do not believe me do you
he is recovering on the third floor
are you kidding me he is not psychotic
i do not know better all i know is that you left me in there
in where
we were forced to use restrains if that is what you are referring to
that was not a fucking restraint
i had a patient a few years ago his name was ted casey
long live the organization for the organized
and that is that
getting away with things like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison

medication what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer
it was part of the treatment i intendedi did not know what the effects would be
so what you guinea pig sick people to find out
the three of you were not regular patients you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove
i did not put you in alpine grove

that is right goddamn you are the spitting image i did not know he had a son
did you know my father
my father used to talk about you
look here i do not like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me
that is too bad
i thought you said you never knew your father
he died because he bled to death from a blow to his head someone had to have given him it
what should they be looking for
where [beat] it is becker is not it he is doing stuff is not he
this is really happening is not it
[beat] what do you need me to do
i need to get this letter to someone
i cannot take you out of here in your condition
and i cannot stay here in my condition i am going to die tonight it is already been decided

i do not believe a thing she just said
me neither who was the boy she was talking about eugene

where are we going
that is happening to me why am i getting so much weaker
you gotta stop thinking like that
then where are you going
i have been ok
good how is your mom
i think so
how you doing
he just saidthat i would shock eugene and then things would change for him
i do not understand
and if i did not want to come
i guess i would ask you why
because i do not think i am crazy
why what would you do
i could try tomake it stop
no i do not want it to
you should be careful you could be killed if they found you out here
my god you look exactly like him
i never knew my father did you
at the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things
what case
how would he get it
[beat] i do not know
well do you think dr becker would have any idea
how do you know about dr becker
it is important for you to know who your father was is not it

why do not you help me
because i do not have time
why not
i am about to die unless i do something to stop it
and how do you know that
because of the future i know that is going to happen
some part of you suspects  even if you do not know for sure  that what i am saying is true
i do not know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions
howhow do you know
you told me this was how it happened
whowho kills me

[beat] why
you do not think that is crazy
this is a great song
so you never knew your mother
i guess not but as of now i never knew either
i am sorry
i am sorry
yeah me too [softly] every day for the last ten years
we have been hailing the groznyy for the last hour mr secretary the groznyy refuses to stop
and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
jesus christ guys what the hell's khruschev thinking
well i am not
goddamn stevenson jesus peace at any price you would think nobody learned anything from world war two
he gets it but he is pissed
we were just debating who had it worse us or george washington and his guys
who gives a shit about the midterms now the soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us
the other thing is
i will do it
jack i am as conniving as they come but a sneak attack is just wrong
what happened to speak when spoken to
rescind the order can all the chiefs put nitze gilpatric and the undersecretaries in charge
adlai's too weak we have to convince jack to pull him get mccloy in there
you cannot take him out this late in the game
zorin will eat him alive
then talk to your brother goddamn it the two of you do not need any advice to get into trouble
oh still sore about this
my father 
adlai can handle zorin he knows the inning and the score
where have you been we have been trying to find you all morning
helen and i went out for breakfast excom's not supposed to convene til eight
we are getting everyone together as fast as we can
and jack wants to trade the missiles in turkey
hey mac you are up bright and early
what did you think of lippmangs column this morning
then they should speak up
christ ken you know it is not that easy
every day the sun comes up says something about us
that is correct
and the second condition
john how much time
guess we cannot blame khruschev for a few patriotic farmers and the ships
still heading for cuba
 i have the authority i am the commanderinchief of the united states and i say when we go to war
what happens to you i am not leaving without you
i saw you out there you want him to call you back need you
how is my favorite president
busy but you have got his heart
i want an hour with him
i said his heart not his attention
three weeks before midterm elections you need me
well there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about
pretending there is not a problem will not fix it he can clear the air on anglo american relations
kenny what happened they did not let me up front said the president was on the phone the whole time
why do not you ask him yourself you can have him on the way home
there are major rail disruptions in the south two airborne divisions are on alert that exercise is an invasion
well you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi
secretary of defense
dean rusk
i guess you will not be coming home tonight
get back out there kid remember to hit 'em hard
what about you where are you going
i was eating that
no you were not
so what have we got today
still think cuba is not important
call me irish but i do not believe in cooler heads prevailing
achesongs scenario is unacceptable and he has more experience than anyone
let's get out of here
have you canceled chicago and the rest of the weekend yet
you do not show for chicago everyone will know there's something going on
i do not care cancel it
i am not calling and canceling on daly you call and cancel on daly
you are scared to cancel on daly
you would worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support
all right 'cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships shots being fired across bows
that is going to be tough you know how these guys are about their chains of command
we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships but it does not get us any closer to removing those missiles
it is a goddman trial balloon trial is the operative word here
jesus christ o wouldonnell you are the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution
did not know adlai had it in him too bad he did not have this stuff in '52
i have got to move what do you have kenny
they know each other khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies
moving the line stroke of genius
it is transparent the press will be all over it
bob bet you had a late night
captain force the sub to the surface for inspection
mr president we are receiving reports that the ships are stopping
captain belay that order  bob where is that coming from
just a second mr president

ms vings sister
i have to talk to your brother
gimme back my bottle
do not hurt him
where is the nearest hospital
 with objection
your honor that is not fair  
i move that the witness's testimony be stricken he has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution he is 
you cannot come back here anything happens to you i am liable
i am a lawyer the firm is thinking about renovating everything dates back to the sixties
i noticed
art's supplies is founded on trust mister 
what everything you shot a corpse i do not give a shit about that  
clyde you wait here  glenn got a minute
i had a minute before the mapp hearing  but i could not get you on the phone eddie
no it is not the only issue there's another issue for the jury what about entrapment
have not heard that one before ed  but i guess i will be hearing it again
come now did you see the gun
i can describe it
you cannot remember that  
i can see the hammer still it was cocked
how can you remember that
not the whole time of course i 
exactly what information led you to arrest my client just twoandahalf hours after the shooting took place
we had a description of the suspect
you are implying that i planted a gun
not at all 
kim's prints were all over it  he admitted it was his gun f'r godsake
you see that you wanna be like that
no no
i do not venerate drug dealers roger to the contrary
of course
through use of informants eavesdropping unreasonable search and seizure
right you are right
i specialize roger
 an angel dust dealer 
i am not a kid anymore i cannot be all over the map 
 a speed manufacturer 
ten years is a long time
so what would we claim he stabbed duane lindeman in selfdefense
we are taking the other case
what other case
you really think that is what happened
 easy as that huh
easy no we have to find some piece of evidence that got buried to reopen the sucker
when did you start working for the goddam da
eddie that is a dd5
that dd5
what the lunatic who 
do you have to do that
shoulda told the one about shu being the bastard child of mother theresa
his name is chuckie roeder but something's very weird
they are just frightened fuckedup losers that prison fucked up worse
i did not ask for a closing argument
a fucking wheelchair
eddie dowd
chuckie's address i sneaked a peek at the rolodex
so what are we gonna do
what do you mean
well i mean roeder's gone now a dead end believe me i am sorry too but
i am not that desperate
i am eddie  we have got nothing
i have got a meeting in chinatown
eddie  it is art esparza
you phoned up art esparza's wife
they could have been brothers it is why the eyewitnesses picked shu
the killer was not chinese cecil stipe was right 
how long did it take badalato to drive jimmy chings body from chinatown to the morgue
you are the police expert in chinatown gangs
for ten years now
do you speak cantonese mandarin or both
they are chinamen who speak english we call them informants
murder witness
you are doing a murder case
stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward kitty y'oughta start looking for the others
beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors
just which constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle pcp
forget it you have blown your chance to participate in this case kitty
i embellished
dowd also reports that his team of private investigators
i embroidered
are close to naming the man they believe actually killed jimmy chin
 find him
i have not thanked you for your work kitty you are doing good work
i am a professional eddie getting paid is all the thanks i require
got any booze in the house
you do not drink booze
you do
eddie this is silly are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and 
eddie go home get some sleep
i do not need sleep
i need sleep some of us are mere mortals
my mother find you
want to tell me what went down here
racist asshole came at me
exactly what happened then
but why would a guy would do that paint black teardrops on his face
i guess he wanted you to think he was somebody he was not
but why
maybe because someone's afraid
afraid of what
i do not know the truth maybe
 about what
about chinatown what went down
what went down
you tell me man
no you tell me shu
how can i tell you what i do not know
you cannot so tell me what you do know  say it
i do not know shit man goddammit 
i am dying out there
quite a bit you did not tell me
it was selfdefense
 how could i help you
oh come on cecil
are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot jimmy chin was not the man the cops arrested
you told the desk sergeant you were certain mr kim was not the killer  you left your telephone number
yyes sir
did the police make any attempt to phone you to follow up
no ssir
i would llike to answer the question
edward t dowd
this and that
my staff tells me it is been mostly drug pushers i said that cannot be the same edward dowd
it is in the area of narcotics mr reynard that the government tramples on the fourth amendment
what am i looking for you are the one talking deal
friday's the dropdead date on the offer
please do not bullshit me mr reynard you have got witness problems you have got proof problems
i see he would walk out next month
i never joke about waiving a client's sixth amendment right to trial
you are pissing me off again ed
but i am a quick study tell your deputy da  rabin  that i will see him in court
 objection your honor this case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with
 alleged crime 
 cannot mr dowd find his own expert witness your honor
yes mr dowd
did not this investigation with its attendant publicity catapult you into the office you now hold
did you do any handson work or did you just supervise from on high
mr dowd i was personally involved with all phases  and principals  of the investigation
lou sklaroff vin badalato dave montell
in those days they often worked as a team
i do not think i know that name
 but you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation
i cannot be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact
i did not say he was an informant but since you mentioned it was not esparza your primary informant
is not it true that without esparza you had no investigation
i think you are a dangerous man mr dowd
you read eddie's chase manhattan bombing summation in the leftist law anthology
my skiptrace turned up two cecil stipes one's in butte montana other's at riverhead veterans psychiatric
i will take odds on cecil number two
you getting this
 every word
it is okay it was always like that
should not one of us
what do you want
what were you why were you at shu's trial this afternoon
i followed you here from court
i knew jimmy chin the boy who was shot okay
and you were at the trial to to see that justice was done
then it was your idea to have chuckie roeder scare eddie off the case
 why do not you ask chuckie
mr ortega you have known the defendant at ossining correctional for how long
five years
mr ortega what is la compania
a cubano army basically inside and outside prisons
and its purpose
fighting the aryan warriors and the black guerrillas basically
for control of the prison drug trade
do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade
yeah we do some of that
name rank and serial mr ortega let's not hide behind the fifth
i am a soldado in the gwing regiment
and what does a soldado  a soldier  do
a soldado he runs messages and materiel between the regiments
materiel what do you mean by that
cigarettes candy bars  pcp crack
if a member of the aryan brothers tries to cut in on your distribution
a soldado he takes care of it
by takes care of you mean kills
is not it unusual for an asian to be accepted into a cuban prison gang
shu's the only one i know of
and why was an exception made
chinatown sounded pretty cold
i think what eddie wants to say is 
the phone company was broken up
abrams yes how are you today
i am fine
why did he go to see mary rooney
she is the only nurse who is not testifying for the doctors
how good's your intelligence
very good
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr thompson
four cases in three years
the mangs an ambulance chaser
i want to settle this thing and be done with it i do not want the archdiocese exposed
if we were to go to trial would we win the case
well of course it is always dangerous
how did you settle on the amount
we thought it was just
that was our insurance company's recommendation
nothing that we can do can make that woman well
and no one will know the truth
what are you doing here
here's your mail call mrs doneghy
yes get her on the phone
he wants to testify
it looks that way
you know what that would mean
to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he will testify
this is going to drive the ante up
that is the call that i am waiting for
what does it mean
they want to settle  it means a lot of money
you are aware of the penalties for perjury
it is a crime
yes  it is a crime a serious crime
i would not do it
they lied
'they lied' indeed when did they lie and do you know what a lie is
i do yes
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago
that is not my handwriting
you have just said you signed it
yes i yes i signed it yes but i i did not write that figure
you did not write that figure and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years
i thought i would need it
dr thompson just so the jury knows you never treated deborah ann kaye is that correct
that is correct i was engaged to render an opinion
engaged to render an opinion for a price is that correct you are being paid to be here today
just as you are sir
are you boardcertified in anesthesiology doctor
no i am not it is quite common in new york state
i am just an md
do you know dr robert towler
i know of him
how is that
through through his book
what book is that
meth methodology and technique
of anesthesiology
'methodology and techniques of anesthesiology' yes
how old are you
i am seventyfour years old
uhhuh still practice a lot of medicine
ed concannon
objection we have
to get her heartbeat back
we have touched on this his own witness has said
almost nine minutes causing brain damage
mr concannon
nothing further your honor
objection this is ri expect us to accept a photocopy we have the original right
no further questions
no actually she was referred to me she was dr hagmangs patient
say it
i was her doctor
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth nineteen seventy
anything special about the case
thank you when debby
dr towler who was in the operating room with you
mary rooney the obstetrical nurse
what did these people do when her heart stopped
we went to code blue
why was not she getting oxygen
well many reasons actually
tell me one
she would aspirated vomitus into her mask
and her heart stopped and she was not getting oxygen
that is right
and what did your team do
well we
a patient riddled with complications questionable information on her on her admitting form
we did everything we could
you reached down into death now is not that right
my god we tried to save her you cannot know you cannot know
that is all right
the archdiocese called up they said who was our attorney 'cause the case is coming to trial
i doubt we will have to go to trial
we told them we did not want it to come out this way
i completely understand
if i could accept the offer right now i would  they took it back
dr thompson
i have some errands to run and then i thought we would spend the evening
that is what i would planned to
i am going to take you to the home to see the girl
from what i have seen mr galvin you have a very good case
yes yes i think so i hope you will be comfortable i am putting you up at my
i made a reservation at
apartment  no no please you do not know who we are dealing with i please believe me they
dr thompson from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventysix
i did not do too well for you
no you did fine
i am afraid that is not true  will you want me to stay on till monday
no no thank you doctor you go home
you know sometimes people can surprise you sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth
you sure you do not want me to stay on
i in that small context i would have i would have to say 'no'
then you are saying there's no negligence based on my question
i given the limits of your question that is correct
the doctors were not negligent
they gave her the wrong anesthetic
why is that
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance she
that is what the sister said the chart said she ate nine hours prior to
she went in complaining of stomach cramps good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart
is that what a good doctor would do how old are you please
i am seventyfour years old
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics
she getting good care over there
'code blue'
'practice and methodology in anaesthesia' general textbook on the subject is that correct
i yes it is
negligent yes it would have been criminal but that was not the case
dr gruber
i appreciate  a man as busy as 
i read the hospital report on your client
deborah ann kaye
they called they are going to settle what i want to do is build up as much
right who called
the archdiocese called they want to settle her estate
her doctors killed her
do you know who her doctors were
i read the file yeah marx and towler i know who they were
we have to we we have to keep you under wraps please do not do not discuss
i understand
thank you
that is perfectly all right
uh why why are you doing this
i have been meaning to come in a long time
you live in the neighborhood
uhhuh my nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months so i stopped by
how old is he
thank you
you are really  you are you the one they told me was the nurse
i used to be a nurse
these are your initials 'kc'
what did she say
she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital
and did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record standing for one hour
i did
yessir i am sorry
why is that
things change
that is true sometimes they change sometimes they do not now i remember back to when you were disbarred
what is it
thank you for seeing me
i need an extension for my case
you should have taken their offer especially if you were unprepared
i had a witness disappear on me
that happens
is the plaintiff ready
yes mr galvin
nothing further your honor

of the procedures
yes the roving nurse

we we were rather busy
fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped  and they resume seven minutes
as i have said we had some more
they start again three minutes earlier
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes  we were trying to restore her
what happened in those three
we were trying to restore her heartbeat
what happened in those three minutes
we would gone to 'code blue' we were administering electro
huh and why is that
how'm i doing so far
stearns harrington you know who that is
looks almost cold now do not it
that will not start no more fires  we might's well go home
yeah  no sense staying out here
it is an enemy sneak attack  let's get outta here
wait a minute  wait a minute bombs do not unscrew
it is no meteor that is for sure
we would be the first to make contact with 'em  see
we would be in all the papers
hey there  open up
that explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move
madrid has just blacked out nothing more coming through
mister secretary  if they link up with those others near fresno
hey you  better get outa here
i am looking for some pacifictech professors
hurry up  jump in
you look kinda lost yourself
is that it over there
did you see it come down
yesi was fishing up in the hills
that is that fellow over there trying to do  dig it out
you seem to know a lot about him
well i did a thesis on modern scien tists  working for my masters degree
did it do you any good
why sure  i got it  do you have a match
aw he is not that good
i do know himslightly
i did not know how to stop you
i might have recognized you without the beard  and you did not wear glasses on the 'time' cover
they have all stopped at the same time
how does it happen cars are running
the troops are certainly moving in here
did not you have something to do with this  i know you sent word to the sixth army command
i just told them the local situation colonel heffner's in full charge now
we cannot go into town  everybody's getting out of there  i will fly you over to pasadena
can you handle one of these
you will hit something  cannot you go higher
i never noticed before  that is a cowboy tie
is that machine
it is gone now
do not you live at home
no on the campus  i have not any family
i come from a big one  nine of us all in minnesota except me
a big family must be funi imagine it makes you feel you belong to something
it doesmaybe that is why i feel kind of lost right now
we will get safely out of here do not worry
but they seem to murder everything that moves
how long was i out
nothing there now
it was  one of them
what was it like
i could not see much in the dark  but it was one
maybe they are not too sure we are here
they could be as curious about us as we are about them
they have blocked it
is it possible to go in right after the explosion
yes with these suits  we have used them before on atomic tests odd looking are not they
very futuristic  yours does not really go with that butch haircut
i could wear it longer  but it is less trouble this way
my kid brother has one  you know why
yes   fits better in a football helmet
how would you guess
the rockies  you would rather get back to that big family of yours in minnesota would not you
i probably would not be able to get to them if i tried
you will be all right with us  for as long as anybody's got
that is what knocked the phones out too
how could it happen to everybody's watch together
that needle ai not pointing north
what is that gizmo
i think that  gizmo  is a machine from another planet
this martian blood  let's make a quick analysis and see what we have got
a forlorn hope  but there is a chance
it might give us time to search out some weakness in the martians
gratzman  gratzman  did you get those biotics
no  i thought you had them
there's one  there's the other and we are right between them
so is the town i notice
i warned you civil defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate
colonel  shooting's no good
it is always been a good persuader
that is their position  you have certainly got them surrounded  i suppose they have neutralized all communications here
thank you sir  if they start anything we can blast them right off the earth
that probably dropped half way to pomonawhat do you think
uncle matthewthis is dr clayton forrester  my uncle  dr matthew collins pastor of the community church
they do not do much of anything
they are living creatures out there
but they are not human  dr forrester says they are some kind of an advanced civilization

that is not why i called
oh yeah  sure okay
santos it is not
have it your way but you want it
lula's gone off with sailor

i want you to take care of sailor so he will not ever be able to bother my baby again
big is the key word and i am telling you i want it bad
i want you to get rid of sailor
get rid of him
yes get rid of him
how would i do that send him on a trip  like maybe to hawaii
santos why in hell do you insist on playing this stupid game
just tell me what you want
i do not need to explain anymore'n i have you know damn well
you need to explain it
all right i want you to kill sailor as simple as that
simple kill him how
that is your business i do not care how
like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt
no for god's sakes santos
explain it i told you
shoot him
but where in the head not the chin i hope
no in the brains what little i am sure he has
see i knew you had it all under control
why did not you send johnnie farragut
maybe i did try new orleans first lula cannot ever stop talking about that town
you give me your permission to kill johnnie farragut
santos no please santos
you are not telling me that you are sweet on him
i am gonna take your silence as a yes
santos i cannot
shhhh it is all right also i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed
you fucker do not you ever touch lula  you fucker i will kill you
you got nice tits
someone's gonna see us
that is just another part of the price to pay
santos where is jjjohnnie
sailor ripley can i talk to lula
no i just wanted to kiss you good bye you know too much about little lula's mom
whattya mean
you are gonna have to kill me to keep me away from lula
oh look at this what do you want snakeskin
just passing through on my way to who knows where
sure i figured i would see you sometime
hoping you could tell me if there's a contract out on me i really need to know
by who
i think santos or marietta fortune
heard you was going out with that bitch's daughter
you heard right
you really are one dumb asshole
i did not see nothing
yeah but i did and i told you all about it
is there a contract we made a deal once that we would tip each other off if we ever heard
i will tell you the problem you behind the wheel there's your fucking problem
that is pretty simplistic do not you think
hey pal you do not start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens
excuse me did you or did you not have a gun to his head
he is fine he is narrating
hey what are you guys doing here
i like what you have done with it whengs captain nemo moving in
you all right professor tripp
you snore
so i hear
no offense professor tripp but you look sorta crappy
it is the chancellor
thank you
how are you crabtree
your wife
oh we are picking her up downtown
lay off pittsburgh it is one of the great cities
if it can produce a miss sloviak you will get no argument from me
she is a transvestite
you are stoned
it is fine it is done basically i am just sort of tinkering with it
great i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend think that might be possible
i do not know i am sort of at a critical juncture
i thought you were tinkering
i just mean
you did not actually purchase this car did you trip
it was jerry nathangs he owed me money
he said something about being between things
she left me crabs
left you who emily
this morning i found a note in the kitchen
i thought you were mrs gaskell's hobby tripp
piss off crabs i lost a wife today
i am sure where is everyone
he has a book
i know he started it fall semester
so is he any good
no not yet he is not
no sexual confusion there eh professor
he is a boxer a flyweight
huh uh a jockey his name's um curtis curtis hardapple
not curtis
vernon then vernon hardapple the scar's are from a  from a horse he fell during a race and got trampled
and now he is addicted to painkillers
he cannot piss standing up anymore
he lives with his mother
and he had a younger brother who was a
groom named claudell and his mother blames vernon for his death
that was good
that is this guy's problem
wait here i will be right back
listen hannah i am flattered really but right now i 
you stay there
sometimes we have to improvise
think hannah does james have any friends i mean besides you and me
james my james that is happened
nothing he is just been sort of i do not know kidnapped
kidnapped by who
his parents
good god let's go rescue him
good idea crabs only one problem i do not know where they live
ah wait a minute the university must know where he lives
it is a little late to call admissions
is it a little late to call the chancellor
i have been doing this a long time tripp i feel this kid in my bones
how bad is it for you
bad enough and god knows i do not exactly fit the new corporate profile
so tell me about you and the chancellor
that is to tell
jesus there must be two dozen windows on that thing how are we supposed to find his
so modest
so sensitive
is he awake
i am afraid he is pretty worn out poor kid
shut up james
so that is the problem
who do you think it is
the chancellor's here now
so  what do we do now
find the jacket
oh huh exactly how do we do that
first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car
want some help with that
let me get this straight jerry nathan owes you money so as collateral he gives you his car
only now i am starting to think the car was not exactly jerry's to give
so whose car is it
my guess  vernon hardapple
the hood jumper
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his
such as
'that is my car motherfucker'
uh huh so we find vernon we find the car we find the car
christ tripp how did you know
naturally you have copies
i have an alternate version of the first chapter
you will be all right then look at carlyle when he lost his luggage
that was maccaulay
or hemingway when hadley lost all those stories
kind of a sign you are saying
in a sense
the jacket tripp we need the jacket
came to my senses
ah well congratulations meanwhile what is james supposed to do pray for walter gaskell to come to his
walter gaskell is not going to send james leer to jail crabs i know that
do you know he will not expel him
no but i do not think that matters

where are you grady an elevator
i am in kinship listen sara there's some things we need to talk about
you are in kinship
yes but that is not why i called
with emily
what no there's no one here i am just just
reconcile with emily
goodbye grady
no sara you do not understand
it was my mother's she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school
it is very convincing
it is just for good luck some people carry rabbits' feet
are you and hannah seeing each other james
no what gave you that idea
you are not like my other teachers professor tripp
you are not like my other students james so what was the movie you two saw
huh oh son of fury with tyrone power and frances farmer
she went crazy frances farmer
so did gene tierney she is in it too
sounds like a good one
it does not matter it only took me an hour to write
really that is remarkable
you cold james
a little
so what are you doing out here
it is colder in there
james  do not leave just yet there's something i think you ought to see
i will miss my bus
is that really it
that is really it
the one she wore on her wedding day
they are glass the buttons
it is feels unreal like butterfly wings or something it must have cost dr gaskell a lot
i guess walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things
maybe i am feeling a little sad myself tonight
you mean with your wife leaving you and all  hannah mentioned something about it about a note
shit james you shot dr gaskell's dog
i had to did not i
could not you have just pulled him off me
no he was crazy i did not  he looked  i thought 
do you have a mirror it is the best way to see if someone's breathing
professor tripp can i ask you a question
yea james
does she want to hear it was one of her professors
that is a big trunk it fits a tuba a suitcase a dead dog and a garment bag almost perfectly
that is just what they used to say in the ads come on crabtree i know you are holding
whose tuba is that anyway
miss sloviak's
can i ask you something about her
oh so is  is your friend crabtree  is he  gay
looks like our old friend mr codeine that should take the pinch out of my ankle  have one
this is so embarrassing you guys had to carry me out
mmhmmm knap sap
shit he must have left it back at thaw in the auditorium
thank you
i am okay i just lost my balance
huh oh no this is not emily's i just write in it
i guess there's probably a story behind that
the guy on the phone
afraid so
that is a big book you are writing
i think it is sort of writing itself at this point
how did i get here last night
no one seems to know where you live james hannah thought you would like my couch
and and before that did i do anything anything bad
how is that
i got kicked out well not exactly kicked out i was asked to leave
i guess there's probably a story behind that
there is but it is not that interesting
so where have you been staying
it is not so bad i know the night janitor and there's a broken locker i can put my stuff
but james i mean how long
a couple weeks that is why that is why i had the gun for protection
i cannot help myself i do not know that is the matter with me
she seemed to take it pretty well
colon cancer
it is a bit of a scandal my parents live in a small town
carvel where is carvel
outside scranton
i never heard of it
it is a hellhole three motels and a mannequin factory my dad worked there for thirtyfive years
what kind of dancer
whatever kind they wanted her to be
did not you say your mom went to catholic school
i thought you were the guy who did not like to lose control of his emotions
kinship and that is here
the one that left you
someone jumped on your car with their butt
how can you tell
want one they are incredible incredible
maybe she did not come here
it is not that it just reminded me of  you know  of that is in the car in the trunk
i just wanted a little sip
i just wanted a little sip tell me james exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy
you are mad because i shot your girlfriend's dog
it is warm
that is why they all give you such a hard time in workshop
jealous of me
you are lying
the hell i am
yes you are my stuff stinks i know it you said so yourself
let me spell it out for you james books do not mean anything not to anybody not anymore
you coming
want a bite
no thanks
that is why you are having them your spells
spells jesus james you make it sound like we are in a tennessee williams play i do not have spells
what would you call them then
it is because you do not eat
where you going
i am not going with them
james like it or not they are your parents
i remember that five or six years ago
six their plane went down right outside scranton
get out of here
that is why she hates me that is why she makes me sleep in the basement
can i  i mean  do you mind  if i wear this again professor tripp
and we both thank you for that but we are we are fine
do not worry james i will figure something out
i am not worried you are not worried are you professor tripp

i thought we were going to talk last night
listen hannah you do not remember where that aunt worked do you james' aunt
he shot the chancellor's dog did not he the blind one
crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in
crabtree he does not even know james
the aunt hannah where did you take james that day
i told you sewickly heights
but where i need the street
he cribbed that from borges
right anyway i was wondering if i could borrow your car mine's sort of out of commission

i am not sure that is possible
listen antonia

i am working on it
is it because of anna
i do not know she will not talk about it

notice the grain see how deep and rich the red runs
it is my own design you will not find another table like it in the world
it was a beautiful present
then why the fuck are you giving it back to me
you need a table
she was going to throw it out was not she just toss it like a scrap of wood
it was not like that
i made that table for you and annette for your wedding i put a lot of love into it

c'mon walter
you should see my appointment book it got crazy
it is not what you think
i am not a monster
you are a good man walter okay you did some wrong things but inside you are a good decent man
maybe i am not a good man maybe inside i am bad and i will always be bad
i get horny as hell for other women  i mean i fantasize about raping some beautiful woman
you do not have to tell me this
i am just talking man
carlos i never raped a woman
ask me ask me anything
what do you mean
there's a million birds here
they are starlings
is that right
i do not like starlings
why not
they are extremely aggressive birds plus their habits are rather filthy
you always carry these
when i go birdwatching it is why i like coming here
a solitary vireo i like that one
their sound is quite musical
how does it sound
i cannot
i would love to hear it
something like that
that was terrific
you should hear the bird
you live around here
not too far  are you a birdwatcher too
me nah i am more of a people watcher
i have to go
do you come here often
my daddy likes me home before dark
see anything interesting
what are you writing in that book
do not you have friends
i have friends
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends
i am not pretty
what does that mean
that is up
you do not know
i have no idea
i think you do
i have not broken any laws
then you will not mind if i look around
i would
got something to hide
does not everybody
i could get a search warrant
it is not for sale
your ivy too much direct sunlight these plants do not like a lot of sun
fairy tales
the one with the ax
i do not know
sure you do he cuts open the wolf's stomach and the girl steps out alive
you do not know
know what
a man was badly beaten across the street you know anything about that
i was asleep
i did not say what time the assault occurred
you said last night i went to bed pretty early
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty
i was not feeling well
i could take you downtown
that is a nasty scratch on your neck
i have a passionate girlfriend
that is with the boxes
you are a cop figure it out
i would say you are moving
then i would say you are a lucky fellow
i count my blessings
you sure you do not know nothing about this
so how are you adjusting
i am adjusting okay
and your new apartment
apartment's okay
are you taking your medication
it gives me headaches
sergeant lucas  may i come in
the new man i would keep away from him if i were you
why's that
you do not want to know but he is damaged goods  real damaged goods if you know what i mean
have you seen walter
people have the right to know
yeah like the bird
can i ask how old you are
i am twelve
how come
a long time ago i was sent far away when they let me come back all my friends were gone
it sounds like you were banished
would you like to sit on my lap
no thank you
are you sure
i am sure thank you all the same
that is okay does not matter
they sound like finches
my daddy lets me sit on his lap
that is her name
ms kramer
tell ms kramer what your daddy does
i cannot
you said you could not make the sound of a solitary vireo but you did beautifully i heard you
what will happen if i do
but will he 
your daddy will always love you
how do you know
i know because it is just something i know
i do not want to hurt my daddy
i do not mind
you should go home
cannot i stay a little longer
it is getting dark go home
and how is your job
the job's okay
do i take okay to mean you feel good about working there
i said the job is okay
that is right you did  have you made any friends there
i am not running for mr popularity
you seem a little hostile today
it is called sarcasm dr rosen
no need to call me doctor i am a therapist not a psychiatrist
i would like you to keep a journal
a diary
that is right
no way
why not
diaries have sent too many guys to prison
oh it never crossed my mind
of course
it was just an idea
bad idea
that is right
you think reflection is good
it is very good indeed
try it
no fucking way
how is the journal
i am still thinking about it
you do not like coming here do you
it is okay
but you do not like coming here be honest walter
honest no
good that is an honest answer and why do not you like coming here
honest your cheery personality makes my skin itch
is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch
forget it
maybe it is the way i look or the sound of my name
rosen i do not have a problem with that
because if you did i know a therapist named ryan i also know a therapist named chung
how do you feel about that
i do not feel anything
you have no feelings for your niece
she was born after they put me away how can i have feelings
then why are you talking about this
have to talk about something
have you talked to carlos about your concerns
i am not that crazy
do you think you are crazy
if i am not then what the hell am i doing here
why do you think you are here
you know why it is part of the parole deal
is that what you are angry about
how long is this going to take
we have a few more minutes
i mean when will i be normal
we have a lot of work to do
will i ever be normal
i could not say
you could not say
i am afraid not
do you know what normal is
i suppose it is however society defines it
how do you define it
i do not
then how do you know if your patients are getting better
they usually tell me
how do they know
what is your idea of being normal
i want to be normal
then go see a therapist who will tell you you are normal
fuck you rosen
i know 
you do not know
i do not know
what did you think would happen
i do not know
what did you want to happen
you know that if anything happens i spend the rest of my life in prison no parole no nothing
is this the first one
of course it is that is why i am telling you
walter we will pick up here next time
i want to talk about it now
we will talk about it more on thursday
remember when you asked me what my idea of normal was
please do not do it again
i said i was sorry
when did it all start
you mean my problem
if by problem you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes
i do not know
that is not a helpful answer
to relax
i am relaxed
close your eyes and let your mind be blank
no i am not going to 
when i say the word girl what is the earliest image that you can remember
nothing can i open my eyes
no when i say the word pretty when i say the word pleasure what is the earliest memory you see
i do not see 
who do you see
where is she what is she doing how old 
not so fast
sorry  where is she
in my bed rosen where do you think
where are you
in my bed too
how old are you and your sister
we are little kids
but roughly how old
and what are you doing
just lying there  we are taking a nap
a nap
what the hell are you doing there
did you and your sister often take naps together
do not ever do that again
all right
i do not like nobody behind my back
did you touch her did you take off her clothes did you take off your clothes
this is garbage
i am only asking questions
okay i will tell you what i did  just to shut you up  i smelled her hair
what else
that is all i just liked smelling her hair
did you get an erection
i was six years old
it was a small house
all right a small house with small rooms
how do you feel about that
are you okay
want a ride
i am all right
there's something wrong with this picture
what picture
very weird
no weirder than a sharp young good looking woman working in a lumberyard
that is weird about that
most women would not choose it
you are quiet at work
i am just quiet
you do not hang out with the other guys
neither do you
you never spoke to me before
are you
your windows face south northern light is the purest but southern light is very good
is that a school
k through sixth
does not it get noisy
i like the noise
my place faces a truck street i have got cracks in every window from the shaking
you must hate it
what about bears
what about them
they could eat you
i am not easily shocked
i get that impression
so that is your dark secret
why do you want to know
so you are not a dyke
hey that was intense
you are still here
i did not say i did not enjoy it
of course sorry i am such a fucking asshole
no you are not
that is the problem
you think i have a problem
do you
it is been a while since
tell me about it
maybe later
how about in the morning
the morning
i thought i would stay the night
what for
did i say something wrong
i suffer from insomnia
is that all
when i do sleep i sweat a lot usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming
why do you want to know
that is the worst thing you ever did
so what did you do
i molested little girls
you are not joking
look you can go now
what did you do to them
it is not what you think
i never hurt them never
why do not you just go now okay
i told you i am not easily shocked
get your kicks somewhere else
hey i am not 
you do not molest little girls anymore do you
what was prison like
you do not really 
i am sorry walter
sounds like a special guy
i have changed
is it their innocence their beauty
their power they seduce me
they seduce you
i was always the one seduced
you really believe that
no that is what i used to tell myself
and what do you tell yourself now
being here with me
i know
most people say the odds are against me
what odds
i got poked around here and there
which brother did this
all three  in chronological order
you must hate your brothers
i love my brothers
you never asked them about it
are you serious
not ever
you are scared
i am not scared
neither am i
we should live together
live together
it is a bad idea
i do not even know how to live with myself
just think about it
i have got problems
who does not
most people do not have my kind of problems
guess that makes you pretty special
that is this
i do not need a plant
thank you
do not be scared walter
i am not scared
do not do that
do what
sneak up behind me like that
that is your fucking problem
i did not sleep well
do you want to talk about it
i heard they were filthy birds
but your friend is waiting downstairs
how are you
anna maybe it would be better to wait a while
sandro a month is too long a time i have become used to being without you
you will get over it soon it is the usual anxiety
a little more so this time
and what about yesterday at my house did not you have any feeling for me even then
but where are you going
you know i could just as well go without seeing him today
which one shall i wear
this one is gorgeous
claudia are not you coming
i am certainly not going to swim across
is not it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht
and how long will you be away
used to what
to the fact of my retirement not only as a diplomat but also as a father
and have you any other truths to tell me
you already know what they are
up until now dad i have been the one who has not wanted to marry him
without any doubt sir if anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island
allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive
i am sorry sir i did not mean to put it that way but you must understand sir that i
it is already two hours what are we going to do
these people are contemptible they have no sense of dignity at all
what is that one over there called
that must be basiluzzo
say claudia would not you like to climb up with me and take a look over there
at what
well what
have you decided
how wonderful
i think you are very sweet corrado
more so than the shark
there's no comparison
somebody must live here
really still it remains to be seen why she invented a shark what was her purpose in that
maybe you would better ask him
i have a feeling that you are not used to being alone
do not be so humble
how should i be  arrogant
there's nothing much to laugh at
shall we go for a swim
twelve years  but why have not they married
and why have not they left each other
i am beginning to have my doubts it could not be that they are in love
and why do you tell us this only now
nothing nothing at all
are you feeling better
i am sorry about last night please forgive me
you are very fond of anna are not you
yes very much so
has she ever spoken to you about me
i think that you might go and have a look yourself
have you read it they are asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them
yes i had also thought of going there to talk with them
yes you should go
i do not know why i just could not help it
and what about you
claudia listen to me
promise that you will not try to look for me you should not try to look for me any more
any news
let's get out of here fast this is not a town it is a cemetery
sandro  maybe it is best that you go in alone
what is it claudia
oh sandro i am so ashamed of myself so ashamedi tried to hide myselfi feel so small i hate myself 
does it please you to say such things
oh no it does not please me at all
why are you looking at me like that
i am sure you would be able to design some very lovely things
claudia let's get married
what get married
you look at me as though i had said something foolish
and are you sure you want to marry me are you really surethat you want to marry me
but why am i so infatuated with you
hurry up now or it will begin to get hot outside
but you know it already why must i tell you
then i will see you later
sandro wait a moment just one moment you seem like an entirely different person 
sandro listen try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow
are not you going to change
you are that sleepy eh what time do expect to get up tomorrow
good night my love
good night tell me that you love me
i love you
tell me once more
i do not love you
tell me claudia what do you think of raimondo
i would say he is pretty depraved
one would have to be in love with somebody to know that
have you ever been in love
what amazes me is sandro he seems so calm
i am going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands
to do what
i just cannot leave without first searching those islands one by one
but where did you finally end up
it is divine
you say that just to flatter me
i am not coming
should not we try to find a quieter place
my childhood instead was a very sensible one
what do you mean by sensible
patrizia patrizia  where is ettore
patrizia i am afraid
more or less we are all afraid especially at night
you should never wish to get melodramatic over anything
who are you talking to
please you come too
they are all nudes if i am not mistaken
now what do i have to do to be left in peace
it is as smooth and slick as oil
at one time the aeolian isles were all volcanoes
what happened
there's a shark in the area do not move from where you are
looks like the weather is changing
i will stay here also
but why what if it starts to rain
how did you spend the night in that hut and what did you have to eat
corrado why do not you ask them to give it to us as a gift
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat
i am going ashore to take a look around the island there are some ruins up there
there too
and what are we going to do now
i wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff  maybe right here at lisca
i was saying it might even be possible that anna had left with them
and who is this
first let the poor thing have something to eat
what is it
nothing nothing  at all i was just looking for sandro
and you expect to find him in here go and ask claudia
where is she going
you men are all so dreadful
because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman
and where do you find the models
oh there are as many as one wants
it is strange how anxious women are to display themselves it is almost a natural inclination
but how could they pose like that i could not
why do not you try
do not you ever paint men
answer me why do not you try posing i will paint you a beautiful portrait
but why me ask claudia she is much more beautiful than me
but i want to paint you you appeal to me more
they tell me you have a lot of trouble at home is that right
i work there but i am really a stranger
i tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you
and who is she does she work in catania
so that is logical you see both being gardeners they spoke about you to one another
we have a radio like this too
no not like this one
and why would not we have one like this
certainly a radio this small is very practical it is especially useful for i do not know for traveling
anything new develop
look marshal with those deep crevasses you will need some rope and ladders
do not worry we have got everything
another thing there's an old man who lives here on the island
i only exchanged a few casual words with her as one would ordinarily do on a public bus
and do you remember where she got off
there's the trinacria hotel or the regina near the municipal building as for rooming houses i do not know
thank you
are you the owner of this place
no the owners are in australia
but where did you come from
whose boat is that
what boat
just a moment ago did not you hear the sound of a motor
at this time of the year there are so many boats
and how come you are up so early
perhaps she was not feeling well maybe a cramp or something
anna is an excellent swimmer even with a cramp she would have managed to reach shore somehow
patrizia what are you going to do

i never saw any baby i think they made it up
why should they
i do not know
do you remember the night they said it came

how were you sick
something i ate
down there
and what did you do
i went to my room
and what happened
i got sicker
and then what
i fell asleep
where did the baby come from
what baby
the baby they made up
from their heads
is that where they say it came from 
no they say it came from the waste paper basket
where would it come from before that
from god
after god before the wastepaper basket
i i do not understand
agnes how are babies born
do not you know
no no i do not want to answer any more questions
would you like to ask them
what do you mean
that is your real name
martha louise livingston
would you like to be
not at the moment no
would you like some
i cannot have them any more
why not
i have stopped menstruating
why do you smoke
does it bother you
where do you think babies come from
do you know a marie
no do you
why should i
you liked sister paul
she was kind to me she told me i was beautiful
what else did she tell you
sister paul was in her eighties  did she climb up here often
no only when she felt like it she brought me up here last winter and the next day she died
like what
numbers you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end
i do not understand them either do you suppose i was dropped on my head
i hope not it is a terrible thing to be dropped on your head
what happens if the bell rings and you are under there
it is like hiding from my mother when i was a little girl
where did you go
oh no place as wonderful as this agnes have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else
no there is nothing else just being here at night helps me sleep
you have trouble sleeping
i get headaches mommy did too oh but she was not stupid she knew things that nobody else knew
what things
she knew what was going to happen to me that is why she hid me away
how did she know that
you will laugh
i promise i will not laugh who told her
an angel when she was having one of her headaches
do you believe she really saw them
no but i can never tell her that
why not  mmm
did you ever want to be a mother yourself
i could never be a mother
why not
well i do not think i am old enough and besides i do not want to have a baby
why not
because i do not want one
if you did want one how would you go about getting one
from someone who did not want to have a baby
how would that person get one if they did not want one
a mistake
agnes how did your mother get you
a mistake it was a mistake
agnes i do not believe you know nothing about sex
i cannot help it if i am stupid
 that you do not remember getting pregnant
not my fault
 and that you do not believe you carried a child
i was a mistake
what the child
agnes i am here because i want to help you
i am not sick
but you are troubled are not you
that is because you keep reminding me if you go away then i will forget
and you are unhappy
answer me  you never answer me
what did you do
i am always bad
what did you do
you can tell me
i cannot
she cannot hurt you any more
she watches she listens
 take off my clothes and then she makes fun of me
that you are a mistake
because she says if i do not watch out i will have a baby
how does she know that
her headaches
oh yes
i am afraid
agnes you are ugly what do you say of course you do agnes you are ugly what do you say

because i am in trouble
i am frightened
of what
of telling you
but it is easy it is just a breath with sound say it what kind of trouble
how did you have a baby
it came out of me
because i was afraid
why were you afraid
because i was not worthy
may i open my eyes now

of me oh god  my god  water it is all water

agnes who did you see
i hate him
of course you do who was it
i hate him
god  it was god  and now i will burn in hell because i hate him
it was dead
it was alive was not it
what did you do
i put her to sleep
h how
eve she strangled a baby
no no excuse me eve as quickly as i see fit
the bishop is breathing down our necks
marty what are you doing here
larry there's got to be something missing
i gave you the pictures marty what else do you want
something they that they overlooked
what  you think that the girl is innocent
i do not know
that is the matter with you you have seen the reports it is a cut and dried case
maybe there's something that is not in the report that should be
martha it is you
would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long
all i want is one more week
why  you have done nothing to show any progress
yes that is because i am getting to her
you are getting to all of us martha let's face it
i will have a decision by next week
it is gone on long enough you are out
oh joe joe she did not kill the baby
you have proof
no no no
hello mama   brought you something
shut up i am trying to watch this
it is your favourite
who are you
it is martha mama  there you go
marie brings me icecream too you know chocolate my favourite
i thought cherryvanilla was your favourite
not any more now i like chocolate
mama that was not marie that was me
who are you
the convent was built for over fifty not many of us left just us and the chickens
well that is a lot of land you must have help do you have field hands that help you
no we work the land alone noone but sister marguerite and i are permitted contact with the public
oh that one there in the corner
why do you call it an investigation i never have
your mother was a resident of saint catherines home before you moved her
and you had a sister who died in the convent
who told you this
do you still go to church
what business is it of yours
oh we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case
look father ah just because i do not subscribe to the to the beliefs you subscribe to
but what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever doctor but it does make all the difference to agnes
i do not understand are you expecting me to
i am afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age
yes i
you can call me sister
you were a smoker
two packs a day
how did she hide it from the other nuns
she undressed alone she bathed alone
how did she hide it during the day
she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to
did not she have any physical examinations in this time
we are examined once a year her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits
who was the father
i have not a clue
what man had access to her
none as far as i know
was there a priest
yes but i
that is his name
father martineau but i do not see him as a candidate
could there have been anyone else
obviously there was
and you did not try to find out who
believe me i have done everything possible short of asking agnes
she cannot even remember the birth do you think she would admit to the conception
why do you think that
do not ask me those questions dear i am not the patient
that is your opinion
i believe agnes is different
from other nuns  yes i i have noticed
from other people  i believe she is not crazy nor is she lying
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth
because she is an innocent she is a slate that is has not been touched except by god
so someone else could have done it
no not in the eyes of the police
and in your eyes
i have already told you what i thought
that she was unconscious yes  so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the
you do not really believe something like that happened do you
that is absurd
that possibility never occurred to you
well it is been known to happen in the day too maybe agnes went to him
oh come on you have talked to her she does not even know how babies are born let alone made
when did you first learn about her innocence the way she thinks
shortly after she came to us
and you were not shocked
i was appalled just as you are now
and what happened
this was before her pregnancy
why did not you take her to a doctor
it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again
she has it now
i know what you are thinking she is a hysteric pure and simple
not simple no
i saw it clean through the palm of her hand do you think hysteria could do that
it is being doing it for centuries she is not unique she is just another victim
god's victim that is her innocence she belongs to god
nuns you hate nuns
i hate ignorance and stupidity
the catholic church
it is my affair too
then help her
i am
when would agnes have conceived the child
oh some time in january
there's nothing here
was the child full term
oh dear god
what is it
the sheets
what sheets
when was that
the twenty third of january on that night one of our elder nuns passed away
sister paul
you lied to me
about what
your niece
i did not tell you because i did not think it was important
listening to angels
she drank too much that is what killed her
do you know what she did to her
i do not think i care to know
she molested her
oh dear god
there is more here than meets the eye is not there  lots of dirty little secrets
oh god if only i would known
why did not you  you knew she was keeping her home from school you knew she was an alcoholic
i knew that after the fact
why did not you do anything to stop her
because i did not know 
and my permission
we will see about that
do not deny it
i have not decided yet
the womangs health is at stake
her spiritual health
i do not give a damn about her spiritual health
an unhappy woman
she is happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone
bullshit yourself
catholic church does not have a corner on morality
who said anything about the catholic church
you just said
stupid woman and that is all
that is all  that is enough  she was a beautiful little girl
so you left the church because you had freckles
my sister died in a convent and it is her voice i hear  does my smoking bother you
no it reminds me
would you like one  huh
i am out of prac   practice 
all right
fine thanks
do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then
undoubtedly not the ascetics of course but well saint thomas more
long thin and filtered
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet  and of course 
hand rolled
even christ would partake socially
mary magdelen
oh you have come a long way baby
right  what do you suppose today's saints are smoking
there are no saints today good people yes but extraordinarily good people those i am afraid we are sorely lacking
do you think they ever existed
yes i do
do you want to become one
become  one is born a saint
do you think agnes is still attached to god
listen to her singing
i would like to begin
begin what
the hypnotism do you still disapprove
may i be present
of course
stop this she will hurt herself  i am not going to allow this
i have just met with the bishop we are taking you off the case
you are what
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes we will find our own thank you 
one that will ask the questions you want asked
one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect
for the church
for agnes
you think she is a saint
the father
who is he
why must he be anybody
my god you are as crazy as
do not be ridiculous
but how did it happen
you will never find the answer for everything god did
i thought you did not believe in miracles today mother
that is what you believe she is  the sum of her psychological parts
that is crazy how could she find out about it
somebody told her
who  that tun that tunnel has not been used in fifty years
oh would you stop lying mother
i am concerned about her health
this is permission to take her apart
where is she
has not she had enough
i have a few more questions to ask her
who knew she was pregnant
why do you insist upon pressing
was it you
is it because she is a nun
and you did not send her to a doctor
i did not guess until it was too late
for what  an abortion
oh do not be ridiculous
too late for what
i do not know too late to stop it
the baby
the scandal
you went to the room to help with the birth
she did not want any help
you wanted that child out of the way
that is a lie
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room
i did not hide it i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets
before or after you killed the child
i left it with her and i went for help
i doubt that is what she would say
that is enough
agnes what happened to the baby
she cannot remember
oh do not do this
the usual ten per cent
oh not at all i let them have twentyfive sure are not there four of them
how fascinating do go on    john
lay them down
we would be thrown out
they are yours
they are

cannot see a thing  are you sure
oh man  that is no glitch
it is alright it is cool
is it still moving
move it baby or they are gonna be chewing on my cojones
what happened
secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system  i found the grating ripped right off  the little fucker was strong
hey jan  see if you can get someone to check out the chopper
that is the problem
she was running a little sluggish on the way back  think the turbines might be playing up
give me twenty minutes and i will do it myself
that is what we thought
have you got an updated lloyds' almanac to crossreff them through
fort powell  what do we tell 'em
already working on it
it left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here
they knocked out the external feeds
communications to autoshop go through an fo link off the main trunk that is down with the other feeds
it is not all good news  we had to take off the helmet lights  you will be going in blind
there's still time to backout
let's just run through it one more time so i know you have got it straight
okay we are in business
okay i am out of here
hey boss  wondered where you would gotten to
i just wanted to be put on my own for a while  clear my head
i have got a lot of thinking to do  'sides the room was getting too crowded for me
not too much of the socializing type then
i am serious  that is why i switched from orbiting to planetary installations
and before that
six month stint on datus
only six
what is this  'twenty questions'
what is that
first light we will take a chopper out there and tell them to head back
'we'  you wanna fly out there with me
do you think ackland will sit tight
yeah  somebody won
i have found ackland
when we get the link back and i send this in icc will throw a fit
ah do not worry about icc  they are the least of your problems right now
think i spoke too soon
that is the wrong way
hurry it up
theythey snapped my legs to fit fit me in here  i do notremember what happened next
what can i do
i can feel it moving around inside me you have got to kill me
i i cannot
where would you leave them
yeah exactly  those are preprogrammed course adjustments you are looking at
how is it going
you should hit the sack too
nah i will stick it out for another hour or so
what time's sundown
about five minutes
give me a yell is something happens
hello there who are you
how do you know my name
it is a very famous name mr dewitt
i call myself phoebe
may i come in
certainly mr dewitt
i expected to find this little room overcrowded with a theater full of people at your feet
you are more than modest
it is not modesty i just do not try to kid myself
a revolutionary approach to the theater however if i may a suggestion
even so one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy it will be forgotten tomorrow
after you change if you are not busy elsewhere we can have supper
i would love to or should i pretend i am busy
let's have a minimum of pretending i will want to do a column about you
i am about to go into the shower i will not be able to hear you
i can wait where would you like to go we will make this a special night
you take charge
just some coffee
i am not surprised after all that humble pie
i discussed it very openly i told her that i had spoken to lloyd  and that he was interested
just like that eh
just like that
i do not think that is funny
just like it
are you that sure of tomorrow
are not you
all paved with diamonds and gold
you know me better than that
what time
almost four
plenty of time for a nice long nap  we rehearsed most of last night
you could sleep too could not you
the mark of a true killer  sleep tight rest easy  and come out fighting
why would call me a killer
also with the reluctant compliments of max fabian
lloyd i never have any and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish  so he sent it up
some plain soda  lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven
that is for tonight you are invited we are having everyone up after the performance
we are
 something about an old road ending and a new one starting  paved with stars
i did not mean just the theater
so that is it lloyd still just the theater after all
it is nothing of the kind lloyd loves me i love him
i know nothing about lloyd and his loves  i leave those to louisa may alcott but i do know you
i am in love with lloyd
lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america
you have no right to say such things
 and karen
i see and when was this unholy alliance joined
we decided the night before last before we came up here
you sat and talked until it was light
we sat and talked addison i want a run of the play contract
there never was there will never be another like you
what do you take me for
i am sure you mean something by that addison but i do not know what
look closely eve it is time you did i am addison dewitt i am nobody's fool least of all  yours
i never intended you to be
 it is important right now that we talk killer to killer
champion to champion
what have you got to do with it
everything because after tonight you will belong to me
i cannot believe my ears
a dull cliche
you are too short for that gesture besides it went out with mrs fiske
your name is not eve harrington it is gertrude slescynski
she never proved anything not a thing
she was a liar she was a liar
i had to get in to meet margo i had to say something be somebody make her like me
she did like you she helped and trusted you you paid her back by trying to take bill away
that is not true
then say so
yes addison
and you realize  you agree how completely you belong to me
yes addison
i will not play tonight  i could not not possibly i could not go on
i do not suppose there's a drink left
you can have one at max's
i do not think i am going
why not
no it is not  it is for this
it is the same thing is not it
exactly  here take it to the party instead of me
i am tired i want to go home
that is not a waiter my dear that is a butler
well i cannot yell oh butler can i maybe somebody's name is butler
you have a point an idiotic one but a point
we never met that is why
this must be at long last our formal introduction until now we have met only in passing
claudia dear come closer  this is max fabian he is a producer go do yourself some good
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits
feeling better my dear
like i just swam the english channel now what
tell me this do they have auditions for television
answer me this what makes a man become a producer
what makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair
in my case it is necessary too many taxi drivers write plays
then stop being a star  start treating your guests as your supporting cast
she was magnificent
then you have heard too
i was there an eyewitness
you were there at the play  last night
margo lunching in public
it is new margo but she is just as late as the old one
i distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list what are you doing here
dear margo you were an unforgettable peter pan  you must play it again soon you remember miss caswell
it could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it
you have heard of her great interest in the theater
we have that in common
why so remote addison i should think you would be at the side of your protegee lending her moral support
miss caswell at the moment is where i can lend no support  moral or otherwise
the ladies'  shall we say  lounge
being violently ill to her tummy
miss caswell got lucky too late the audition is over
over it cannot be i have come to read with her i promised max
naturally enough your understudy
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy
i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy eve harrington
eve my understudy
did not you know
of course i knew
how how was miss caswell
frankly i do not remember
i take it she read well
it was not reading it was a performance brilliant vivid something made of music and fire
how nice
the implication being that i have not been reading them as written
right here a minute ago
good luck genius
i guess at this point i am what the french call  woulde trop'
when when are you going to do it
thank you so much
is it sabotage does my career mean nothing to you have you no human consideration
only in some ways you are prettier
hi  my wonderful junk yard the mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard
oh well   look through the wigs maybe it got caught
real diamonds in a wig the world we live in
cannot keep his eyes off my legs
like a nylon lemon peel
she is quite a girl that that isher name
eve i would forgotten they grew that way
the lack of pretense that sort of strange directness and understanding
did she tell you about the theater and what it meant
take care of yourself out there
do not get stuck on some glamour puss
i will try
you are not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy
everybody cannot be gregory peck
 you are a setup for some gorgeous wideeyed young babe
how childish are you going to get before you quit it
i do not want to be childish i would settle for just a few years
and cut that out right now
am i going to lose you bill am i
knit me a muffler
what a thoughtful everloving thing to do
bill have i gone crazy bill
you are my girl are not you
that i am
then you are crazy
 in a tin can cellophane or wrapped in a navajo blanket i want you home
you in a hurry
a big hurry be quick about it  so good night darling and sleep tight
wait a minute you cannot hang up you have not even said it
sing it
bill bill it is your birthday
happy birthday darling
the reading could have been better but you said it  now many happy returns of the day
many happy returns of the day
i get a party do not i
of course birthday and welcome home who will i ask
it is no secret i know all about the party  eve wrote me
yeah i will
i love you
i love you too good night darling
it is a good thought
happy little housewife
cut it out
do not let me kill the point or is not it a story for grownups
you have heard it about when i looked through the wrong end of a camera finder
looks like i am going to have a very fancy party
i thought you were going to be late
when i am guest of honor
i had no idea you were even here
i ran into eve on my way upstairs she told me you were dressing
that never stopped you before
well we started talking she wanted to know all about hollywood she seemed so interested
she is a girl of so many interests
it is a pretty rare quality these days
she is a girl of so many rare qualities
i cannot believe you are making this up  it sounds like something out of an old clyde fitch play
clyde fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time
i have always denied the legend that you were in 'our american cousing the night lincoln was shot
twenty minutes
for instance what
thank you
nothing really
the kid  junior that is  will be right down unless you would like to take her drink up to her
would not you feel more natural taking a bow
it is all over
that is all over
the audition
what fire and music
i must have frightened her away
i would not be surprised sometimes you frighten me
poor little flower just dropped her petals and folded her tent
do not mix your metaphors
i mix what i like
okay mix
i am nothing but a body with a voice no mind
what a body what a voice
the exship news' reporter no body no voice all mind
the gong rang the fight's over calm down
i will not calm down
do not calm down
you are being terribly tolerant are not you
i am trying terribly hard
well you need not i will not be tolerated and i will not be plotted against
i did not know eve harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon
it is obvious you are not a woman
i have been aware of that for some time
well i am
i will say
do not be condescending
margo let's make peace
the terms are too high unconditional surrender
just being happy just stopping all this nonsense about eve  and eve and me
it is not nonsense
but if i tell you it is  as i just did were you listening to me  is not that enough
i wish it were
then what would be enough  if we were married
i would not want you to marry me just to prove something
you have had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me margo tell me that is behind all this
bill   where are you going to find eve
the socalled art of acting is not one for which i have a particularly high regard
he does not exaggerate i was good
to margo to my bridetobe
it is only for the license there's a threeday wait  blood tests things like that
i understand she is now the understudy in there
groom   may i have a wedding present
yes dear
you know what i am going to be
a cowboy
a married lady
hello that is your name
you said fortyseven minutes you will never make it
i just wondered
why what
why you have to go out there
i do not have to i want to
is it the money
eighty percent of it will go for taxes
but hollywood you must not stay there
it is only one picture deal
so few come back
i read george jean nathan every week
also addison dewitt
every day
i think we would like very much sure you will not mind
thanks for your help good luck
are you proud of me bill
i will admit i was worried when max called i had my doubts
is that what you want me to be
i am talking about you and what you want
so am i
do not run away bill
from what would i be running
you are always after truth  on the stage what about off
i am for it
then face it i have since that first night  here  in the dressing room
when i told you what every young actress should know
when you told me that whatever i became it would be because of you
your makeup's a little heavy
 and for you
you are quite a girl
you think
i am in love with margo had not you heard
you hear all kinds of things
i am only human rumors to the contrary and i am as curious as the next man
find out
lemme fix you a drink
margo does not play a lunatic birdie
the bed looks like a dead animal act which one is sables
but she just got here
she is on her way with half the men in the joint  it is only a fur coat
what did you expect  live sables
bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here
it was fort sumter they fired on
you need new girdles
buy some
the same size
of course
how do you do my dear
and this is my good friend and companion miss birdie coonan
oh brother
i am sure you must have things to do in the bathroom birdie dear
she too is a great admirer of yours
kill the people  got your key
you bought the new girdles a size smaller i can feel it
adorable we now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop
if i may so bold as to say something  did you ever hear the word union
behind in your dues how much
you do not like eve do you
do you want an argument or an answer
why not
now you want an argument
she works hard
night ang day
she is loyal and efficient
like an agent with one client
she thinks only for me   does not she
well let's say she thinks only about you anyway
you all put together
my back's open  did the extra help get here
there's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers who would you call  the william morris agency
you are not being funny i could get actors for less what about the food
the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres  voila
late for what
do not be dense the party
i ai not dense and he is been here twenty minutes
who are you
miss harrington
what are you doing here
please do not have me arrested please i did not steal anything  you can search me
you were just looking around
that is all
what for
you probably will not believe me
probably not
it was for my report
i have heard of them
ours was one of the first erasmus hall i am the president
erasmus hall that is in brooklyn is not it
i might
the maid will fix it in the morning
i will just pick up the broken glass
how long does it take
it is after one now you will not get home till all hours
that is the door
so there you are it seemed odd suddenly your not being there
i hope you do not mind my speaking to you
not at all
i have seen you so often  it took every bit of courage i could raise
bill sampson he is  he is a director
i am going to take you to margo
oh no
she is got to meet you
there is not another like you there could not be
but if i would known maybe some other time i mean looking like this
you look just fine   by the way that is your name
i thought you would forgotten about me
hello miss channing
eve why do not you start at the beginning
good night eve i hope i see you again soon
i will be at the old stand tomorrow matinee
not just that way as a friend
now who's show up at this hour it is time people went home  hold that coat up   whose is it
some hollywood movie star her plane got in late
do you think miss channing would approve
i think she would cheer
but mr richards and mr sampson
then  would you talk to mr fabian about it
of course
you will not forget it
i will not forget
you must not mind margo too much even if i do
but there must be some reason something i have done without knowing
the reason is margo and do not try to figure it out einstein could not
karen   you will not forget will you what we talked about before
may i have your coat
eve i have heard the most wonderful things about your performance
we are having lunch with a movie talent scout
they certainly do not waste much time
i was wondering whether you would come at all
do not get up  and do not act as if i were the queen mother
i do not expect you to be pleasant
i do not intend to be
i have got a lot to say and none of it is easy
there cannot be very much
oh but there is
 and easy or not i will not believe a word
do you expect me to believe that you did not say any of those things  that they were all addison
no i do not expect you to believe anything except that the responsibility is mine and the disgrace
eve do not cry
i am not crying
tell me how did your lunch turn out  with the man from hollywood
some vague promises of a test that is all  if a particular part should come along one of those things
but the raves about your performance
he is not my friend you were my friends
he can help you
i think i know
something most important you can do
you want to play cora you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it
if you told him so he would give me the part he said he would
after all you have said do not you know the part was written for margo
it could have been  fifteen years ago it is my part now
you talk just as addison said you did
cora is my part you have got to tell lloyd it is for me
addison wants me to play it
a part in a play you would do all that  just for a part in a play
she knows enough not to be here
congratulations eve
hello miss harrington
no thank you  yes i have seen every performance
every performance then  am i safe in assuming you like it
how would hear about it
there was an item in the times i like the title 'footsteps on the ceiling'
it is been a real pleasure eve
back to copacabana but eve margo let me tell you about eve
well if i did not come to see the play i would not have anywhere else to go
there are other plays
no do not go
well  if i am not in the way
what  again
i must say you can certainly tell mr sampsongs been gone a month
you have not noticed my latest bit of interior decorating
well you have done so much that is new
the curtains i made them myself
while you are cleaning up i will take this to the wardrobe mistress
do not bother mrs brown will be along for it in a minute
well  what do you think of my elegant new suit
there's the script to go back to the guild
i have got it
 and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man
right here
it seems i cannot think of a thing you have not thought of
that is my job  see you at tea time
eve   by any chance did you place a call from me to bill for midnight california time
oh golly and i forgot to tell you
do not get up and please stop acting as if i were the queen mother
if you would like
the hors d'oeuvres are here is there anything else i can do
good evening mr dewitt
miss channing i cannot tell you how glad i am that you arrived so late
really eve why
well if you would been here to begin with i would not have dared to read at all
why not
 and if you would come in the middle i would have stopped i could not have gone on
it is the tight girdle that does it
autograph fiends they are not people  those little beast who run in packs like coyotes
well there's one indoors now i have brought her back to see you
you have what
she is just outside the door
would you like a drink it is right beside you
margo nothing you have ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in
of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet
how much time have we
roughly ten minutes
how far to the station
three or four miles
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas
none in sight there are not many along this back road
he always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical
it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down
do you want it on
it does not matter
karen  i have not been pleasant this weekend
we are never deeply angry we just get sore the way you do we know you too well
so many people  know me i wish i did i wish someone would tell be about me
what about bill
what about bill
margo bill is all of eight years younger than you
those years stretch as the years go on i have seen it happen too often
not to you not to bill
margo  margo i want you to know how sorry i am about this
about what
with tears
with tears
i remember
lloyd what happened
up to here that is where i have got it  up to here of all the star ridden presumptuous hysterical
margo again
and again and again two hours late for the audition to begin with
that is on time for margo
then a childish heavyhanded routine about not knowing eve was her understudy
 do not run out of adjectives dear
 everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about until his play becomes a vehicle for miss channing
it is going to be a cozy weekend
what is
i just do not want margo to miss her train as it is she will barely make the theater
lloyd be careful
that was a pity
she wanted to explain about her interview wanted to apologize to someone  and did not dare face margo
you know i have been going over our financial condition  if you will pardon the expression
i am beginning to catch up
if we could cast it properly that is
maybe get some younger actress for the part someone who would look the part as well as play it
you have got to admit it would be a novelty
eve would ask abbott to give her costello
no i got the idea myself  while she was talking to me
with gestures of course
lloyd richards you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of cora
now just a minute
on her knees i have no doubt very touching very academyofdramatic arts
that bitter cynicism of yours is something you have acquired since you left radcliffe
margo  and bill  want us to meet them at the cub room tonight after theater for a bottle of wine
margo in the cub room i could not be more surprised if she would said grant's tomb
i am glad bill's back
three days that is for the bourgeois  i see a midnight elopement waking up a village person
after all maybe she just wants to apologize
 well what happened
you mean  all this time  she would done nothing but apologize what would you say
who is it that is it all about
have you forgotten about eve what she is what she is done
would you really how sweet
i like that girl that quality of quiet graciousness
the general atmosphere is very macbethish what has or is about to happen
there you are both of you max karen has decided it is time to go
where is she
who's left out there
too many and you have got a new guest a movie star from hollywood
you disapprove of me when i am like this do not you
not exactly sometimes though i wish i understood you better
when you do let me in on it
how is the new one coming
the play all right i guess
cora she is  still a girl of twenty
twentyish it is not important
do not you think it is about time it became important
how do you mean
do not be evasive
margo you have not got any age
miss channing is ageless spoken like a press agent
she is your understudy
eve eve my understudy but i had no idea
i am sure you underestimate yourself eve you always do  you were about to tell me about eve
you would have been proud of her
i am sure
she was a revelation
to you too
you have been talking to that venomous fishwife addison dewitt
not mouse never mouse if anything  rat
karen and i just do not want an accident
i have no intention of having an accident
how fortunate that i have an understudy so ready so willing and so able to go on
the audience will want its money refunded believe me
it is been quite a night i understand that your understudy  miss harrington  has given her notice
yes sir
 and bill especially bill eve did that too
you know she probably means well after all
that depends
i mean really deeply angry
i do not think i could be
we are ready with your call to beverly hills
call what call
it this templeton 89970 miss margo channing
that is right but i do not understand
we are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight california time to mr william sampson in beverly hills
i placed
i just played it
play it again
but that was the fourth straight time
then this will be five i suppose you think i am too drunk to count
supposed you dropped dead what about your inventory
margo you by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house
here you are maxie dear one good burp and you will be rid of that miss caswell
the situation i am in ai not the kind you can belch your way out i made a promise
miss caswell  what
well if she can act she might not be bad she looks like she might burn down a plantation
i feel right now like there's one burning in me
whengs the audition
a couple of weeks
i tell you what why do not i read with her
would you
anything to help you out max
this is real cooperation i appreciate it
not at all and you could do me a big favor if you would
all you got to do is name it
you get quick action do not you
think of your health max  more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track
i promise
this is for lawyers to talk about this concerns a runoftheplay contract and this you cannot rewrite or ad lib
are you threatening me with legal action mr fabian
are you breaking the contract

break's over
this colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground  why are we even digging this thing

oh  miss kubelik  i have been waiting for you fran you have
i almost did not recognize you  this is the first time i have ever seen you in civilian clothes
how would you make out on the twenty seventh floor
i thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first  and then 
i am sorry but i cannot tonight i am meeting somebody
oh  you mean  like a girlfriend
just tell 'em  now and then
well in that case could not you  
i am afraid not i promised to have a drink with him  he is been calling me all week 
well it was just an idea  i hate to see a ticket go to waste 
well  i could meet you at the theatre  if that is all right
all right that is wonderful it is the majestic  44th street
how is your cold
what cold and after the show we could go out on the town   i have been taking from arthur murray
how come
marry christmas
thank you  i thought you were avoiding me
well as a matter of fact i was rather hurt when you stood me up that night 
i do not blame you it was unforgivable
i forgive you
one more
i should not drink when i am driving
by the power vested in me i herewith declare this elevator out of order  shall we join the natives
you all right that is the matter
guess i made a booboo huh
no  i like it
really you mean you would not be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this
of course not
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side   is that better
this is a bad day for me
i understand christmas  family and all that 
i think so
what is it
the mirror  it is broken
your phone
oh  yes  just a minute  if you do not mind  this is sort of personal
do not you remember we were at the office party together 
i am sorry mr baxter
miss kubelik    you should not be out of bed
i did not know  i had no idea this was your apartment 
i am so ashamed why did not you just let me die
what kind of talk is that  so you got a little over emotional  but you are fine now
my head  it feels like a big wad of chewing gum what time is it
two o'clock
you are in no condition to go anywhere  except back to bed
you do not want me here 
miss kubelik i am stronger than you are 
i just want to go brush my teeth 
here how about some breakfast
no  i do not want anything
who are you calling miss kubelik
my sister  she will want to know what happened to me
wait a minute  let's talk this over first  just what are you going to tell her
well i have not figured it out exactly
you better figure it out  exactly suppose she asks you why you did not come home last night
someone from the office
and where are you now
in his apartment
his apartment
i mean  her apartment
when are you coming home
as soon as i can walk
something wrong with your legs

you want me to move the television set in here  you play gin rummy
i am not very good at it
i am let me get the cards
i think i am going to give it all up

i do not want it
what do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents
you better win a hand  you are on a blitz
was he really upset when you told him
mr sheldrake oh yes very
maybe he does love me  only he does not have the nerve to tell his wife
i am sure that is the explanation
you really think so
no doubt about it
can i have that pad and the pencil
what for
i am going to write a letter to mrs sheldrake
you are
as one woman to another  i am sure she will understand 
why not
well for one thing you cannot spell and secondly  if you did something like that  you would hate yourself
i do not like myself very much anyway
pick up your cards and let's go
do i have to
who was that
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne like some
now do not go getting any ideas miss kubelik
i just want some fresh air
it is only one story down  the best you can do is break a leg
so they will shoot me  like a horse
please miss kubelik you got to promise me you will not do anything foolish
who would care
i would
why cannot i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you
there's a call for you 
for me
 mr sheldrake

but what about
one night with me
i love you  let him take you home

that is very thoughtful
would not your lie be a lot easier if you were not
you consider your life easy
what are you talking about you got real problems
another place where
i told you to go on in
i think you gotta camp it here
thank you melvin you overwhelm me
they did a nice job cozy huh
you going to come talk to me or not
what did she say
i am a great guy  extraordinary   and she does not want contact with me  i am dying here
because   you love her
no and you are supposed to be sensitive and sharp
picking on me will not help
well if that is true then i am really in trouble
but you know where you are lucky
that is wrong
that is it mean
that somebody out there knows what it is like to be  in here
oh god this is like a nightmare
how do you write women so well
exactly what is your previous experience
so you are practically finished huh
wait  i want to see the painting
just a second  he has to go
why are you doing this
is there a problem
what restaurant
uh fontella's
so you are from around here
where you from
what is this
not too good at small talk eh
look i am real tired and i am not interested in fucking chitchat
that was peterson back there  that goes to the expressway for the airport
you are right  talking too much again
yeah well you just blew your tip pal
what  you think i am running you up
what are you doing
get out  you think i am running you up  get out
you cannot 
sit back  put your seatbelt on
no fucking way
that is your name  we both know it is not nicholai
bain  michael bain
how long have you been freelance
it is just a shootout then  sixty forty at best  not my odds
robert bain driving me  jesus fucking christ
so what happens now
how would you know  just tell me that how would you fucking know
i knew the same way in ten years you are going to know
if you think you can take me quit fucking bullshitting and try it
five million dollars
that is right
you understand that is going on  it makes sense right
oh yeah
you think i would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars
you would be
you do not know a fucking thing about me  you do not have the slightest fucking clue
i am on the scent
no  no  no  i do not believe it
such language in front of a lady
how in the fuck do you know that
good afternoon  we have reservations at the hotel paraiso in costa blanca
no no  i said the hotel paraiso
yes  this is the hotel paraiso
where have you been robert
sick  the flu
send the file  i will have the estimate tonight
how did he know
know what
i do not know what the fuck you are
who is the mark
hello robert
the contract
i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you
i know what happened
i bet you fucking know
i give a fuck  i am done  i quit do you fucking hear me  i am fucking gone
is this how it went nick
a player
he has to clean up  how many bodies were there
um five
get on the expressway
nikita  she helped me find you
what  how did you know i had a cat
took a guess  lucky for you i guessed right
who the fuck are you  who do you work for
you are one of them are not you  a fucking pro
twenty large  that is all
what do you mean 'that is all' what in the hell do you know
i figure that means these are worth ten times that maybe more
ten million 
now what
okay  how did you find me
you are the computer hacker you tell me
an assassin
until a minute ago
what does that mean
who is that other guy
another contractor
so this is something between you and him
because he is trying to retire me
the nature of the business  you remove your competition
forget it
it is simple  you need me  i need you  and we will both need money
i do not need you to get the money  my money
then you can have the disks and i will just walk out that door 
because he took a contract on you he will come for you and he will find you
listen  i do not even know your name
as in daughter of agamemnon
what do you want to know
because i am done
with computers
it is not the same is it
he was taken
because that is how it works  that is what it is about  he was the best he was on top
how did you get into the business
the same way everyone does the government the agency
the cia
more or less
how old were you
they recruited me when i was in high school
jesus  why
languages  i was already fluent in nine languages
you were like a boy genius
some people said that  i never thought so
why not
i was just different
you went from high school to the agency
no  i graduated from george washington university  then i entered the agency training program
they did not give you a choice did they
no they did not
but you knew what they were training you for
they are very good at what they do it is very seductive  the training the weapons the travel 
the exotic women
women  no not really
why not
because you are a women
they tried to kill you
yes  it did not matter much to them as long as i disappeared
tell me about the first time
because i want to know
it was mechanical  very precise it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline
are they usually like that
no  just the first one
after that
they become complicated messy
did it ever bother you
did it ever bother james bond
is that what you wanted to hear something cold blooded something remorseless
it  tell it  for all i know it could be a machine
you said you did not trust it
i have never been to the gulf of mexico  is it as nice as they say
i do not know
why not
it helps me to focus  it centers me helps me think
oh  what do you think about
what will you do if this works if we get the money
i do not know maybe i will live on a boat sail to all the places i have never been
i am kind of tired  i think i would like to try and get some sleep
what do you think he is doing
he will not be looking for you  just be careful  buy a book  keep your sunglasses on
how was the beach
not that i would know but you look like you are really good at it
thank you
i have always wanted to learn something like that
two way
transmits and receives
i paid a lot for these
they saw you coming a mile away  if i had known we would be using 
okay  then what
then we wait
he cannot  the bank has an expensive security system metal detectors and xray machines
that means you will not have a gun
if things go well i do not have to you will already be in a rented car waiting for me
you will have the money  how do i know that you will not 
i will be walking out of the bank unarmed  you will have the gun and i will drive the car
we split the money
five million apiece  you get on your plane i get on mine
sounds pretty well figured out
except if he does not come out of the hotel
i told you he will
you cannot know for sure how can you  i mean you are not him
ten years ago i sat there in that same hotel window sweat pouring off of me waiting 
what is it  i do not like this at all  what is going on here
i do not know  it just happened  i was here ten years ago i am here now  that is it
what did he want
he wanted what i want now to get out of the business  to disappear to some empty greek island
what did he say
he said i could not win  that no one wins at this game
was that it
then he offered me one million dollars to walk away to quit the business
you did not take it
no  i went back to the hotel  and waited
ten years later here you are again
i think i got one today
why did you trade a bishop for a knight
i hate bishops  they are useless  i like knights
did you think they were newlyweds
i did not notice them
when i first saw them i thought they were married
how do you know they are not
it was no big deal  i saw them leave i went in
jesus if someone had 
nobody ever sees me
it is always been that way  the world has always functioned on two levels
and you were drilling these holes
so i could watch the girl that lived under me
apparently this doctor was unable to cure you
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of selfpreservation
because i will take it
can i ask you something
i am sure you will
why  i do not know
is that why you did not want to talk about women before
i did not want to complicate the situation
attraction is a complication
it can be
who was she
someone like me like you  a pro
what happened to her
she was taken
did you 
no  i tried to stop it  i could not
was she the only one
after her i realized that to survive i had to live without it is dangerous to let things become complicated
is this becoming complicated
when i gave you my gun and you almost shot me
that does not sound normal
he is coming electra  get out now
i thought it was interesting 
god damnit electra  this is not a game  this is business
right  in my hands i have five backup disks he made of all of his work last night
jesus  why did not you tell me
hi  did you call 
i prefer it like this
would you like a drink
why are you working today
you are very good at this are not you
that is okay hon i always expect the unexpected
do you ever regret things you have done
everyone regrets something
do you think about their wives or their families
do you ever think about starting over
all the time
then i will sail alone
do you believe that
how much farther
i think i have heard of you
it is possible
you are pretty famous are not you
a dime
everyone who plays the game knows the rules
do not know  that is how it works
can i ask you something
go ahead
everyone handles it differently some are ready some are not
why did not you fade
you wish to close this account today
that is correct
how would you like the funds
american currency
this will take some time
excellent senor  if you could follow me
i am sorry but i am waiting for an associate  can you hold everything for me until he arrives
of course senor
that is true doug writers are supposed to write
what are you having
a coke if they have it
cheers katka
naz draviwhat do you like about this place these people chris
well he sure seems fired up all of a sudden
it will not last believe me and you when will you go back to the states
your a good guy chris you deserve a nice girl
like you
he_s the closest we have got to an intellectual
fresh from the shrink i would say
what is it with that josh guy who does he think he is shoving that reflections rag down our throats
son of the american ambassador and a banker  good enough
but we are underground
inspirations a fickle thing you do not realise you had it till it is gone
you guys having a go a me or what
we are only jokingit is your round though
sorry katka but i am with doug on this
what about that squat bar you showed me is that open on a sunday
anything in it
no just crap i want some picture frames
i do not have the money for those bourgeois traps hell i am making what a czech earns
that is that free
just because they have got a choice of four mcdonalds does not mean they can afford a cheeseburger
hmmsmells good cheers
what did the beer cost
fifteen crowns
this place is getting expensive too used to be twelve
oh yeah that is that
an alternative literary venue
i ai not sure poetry will go down too well here
no it is the whole idea behind it how did they get this place
squatted it
right and not just the bar lubosh and his mates took the whole freaking building
what we need is a space for real performance art a cultural exchange for radical expressionism
he is not drunk he is crazy
maybe but someone's got to make a stand
amazing he did not even say if
puppet theatre do not you need something a little bigger
okay it is in here somewhere let's keep it quiet
you were right jahn it is a great space hey chris do you want to come and look
alright i give in but let's not end up in jail okay
no i got nothing till tuesday
that stinks
no but like my dad said there's only so many ways you can wire a plug
he was an electrician
no he was talking about girls i think
i feel like a mole in this joint so i guess i might as well come out looking like one
and put it on expenses
not bad hey i think i will add sparkie to my resumegood shovel
i thought that was part of the charm
i will drill the locks and replace the barrels that way it will not cost so much
and if the police stop by  what do i tell them
tell them we are working for the university
thought of everything have not you
yep except a name for this place
wowwhat have you been doing rolling around in it
no just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment that is all
well do not get carried away
i will try not to i will leave that to you anyway there's still plenty more of it
no why
'cause you stink of booze
yeah that was honza's idea i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear
i am an idiot
nope not even close i have thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though
really the freeman centre
nothe asylum
oh yeah that is my connection to that
none it is mine  you said it earlier i am nuts
yeah i am beginning to see that
i do not know but that used to be a window and i think that was a door
can you do the lock on it
it must be on the other side of this
but how did the wall get here
i would love to get in there
do not we have enough already
it must be fair old size suppose it is empty
and suppose a little old lady lives there
no way it is sealed  if she is in there she is dead
sounds like a good reason to leave it alone
well it is definitely there  we have just got to get to it
why how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe
i will rig up something do not worry  do you think i could bash through with that little hammer
i do not know doug we have not even got the place together and already you want to extend it
look i gotta get going should not you have met katka
need any disks
yeah her name's kavlova why
see if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls give it a bit of atmosphere
moved on to plumbing huh
destroy the evidence huh
could you handle it if it was in a good cause
like helping a sick kid
just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better
that is that five instead of ten years jail
it looks new they might miss one or two
we are going to need it all
jesus doug they will execute us
let's split
not yet we need a few lengths of scaffold
so why did not we
am i late

you know everyone can be controlled pavel where are you storing the personnel files
in a building belonging to the university in the old town
you are quite sure it is secure
the files are in a sealed room and the university are under strict orders to stay away
you are responsiblewhat has happened
what are you an idiot
the building has been occupied and the locks have been changed
the university cannot do this is the room safe
so who is in the building
and what of these foreigners
and there has been enquiries from the american embassy maybe they are involved
all the more reason to eliminate him

bruce wayne   i have read your work  i quite like it
great  give me a grant
this is miss vale  that felt redundant
what is it you want
i want you to hang up the suit and i want you to stay away from vicki
i cannot do that not while the joker's still at large
tell me knox if you have got the story why have not you printed it
do you want a drink

there's terror everywhere  if you train yourself to look for it
bruce really when i say these things i do not mean to criticize you

oh honey we may need that
barbara honey  do not go out there  you do not know 
oh adam do not ever leave me alone

i do not know what are you looking up
we need some help  i found something this morning  here emergencies  'in case of emergency draw door'

honey i think that was a mistake
i am not going to expose that little girl to that pervert down there
and your sushi was remarkable
the sushi  i did the wine did not you do the sushi
n no  i just did the ink spots
maybe they will leave now  that snake was a pretty nasty customer
he might have hurt somebody
uadamu  why did you build a whorehouse  have you ever been to
you know i have been thinking  i could teach lydia to sew
let's see if she can get my model back
what time is it
330 i guess
oh adam do not tease her  you never got an a in science in your life
a are you the guys who are hiding out in the attic
you can actually see us  without the sheets
why are you creeping around delia's bedroom
we were trying to scare your mother
uyouu did this  you carved all these little figures and houses and things
i certainly did  i would finish it too but i do not get out much
and this used to be your house i bet  why do you want to scare everybody
we were not there  the handbook says funerals are not for the dead
what is going on
did you get the paint
we studied all day yesterday do not tell me
so can i
uhuh  only if you got uaboveu a c on science
you do not have an appointment do you
nine months  what difference does that make
good luck  you are going to use up all your help vouchers
but the deetzes are udestroyingu our house
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife  so that is my cut
okay  but that betelgeuse sure seemed mad
this is umyu town
are you available
udo not say his nameu  just practice do it uyourselfu
handbook  when
unever trust the livingu  we ucannotu have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death
all right  who are you
we are
just get some people out of our house
bioubustingu  i ulovesu biobusting who do i gotta kill  family  right  obnoxious i bet  mommie daddy piglets
folks be reasonable here  i am at your service  you be the judge i am a harmless guy  try me
you lillylivered bleeding hearts
i would nearly given up on you  i was about to leave  i do have other clients
are you juno our case worker
yes  i evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed deserved and available
we are very unhappy
if we have trouble  what about the guy in the flyer  betelge
no you do not  he does not work well with others
the whorehouse was my idea i want betelgeuse out of the picture  we have got some serious talking to do
if i had seen a ghost at your age i would have been frightened out of my wits
you are not gross  why were you wearing a sheet
tell the truth
we cannot  we have not left the house since the funeral
i hate you  i cannot trust anybody
he said if i let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you

you could double the size of your hardware store  you will be rich
oh honey i did not mean anything  it is just too big for you two i know these things
mr and mrs maitland  i have come for the last time  where are you  barb

so you are ready for me now
you have got to help them
can you help umeu

your qu  but you are
he is a clovenhooved beast
it is uothou
i feel like we have been at war charles
at least insofar as we have our first casualty  me
otho will know what to do
that is he going to do  viciously rearrange their environment
just do not tell lydia
why not
they are probably guilty about what they did to me
what do you think honey
lydia relax  we will build you a darkroom in the basement
where is your mother
i was just trying to open the door  mrs butterfield brought over a skeleton key
darling cannot you see i am relaxing in here
dad  do you believe me

lydia i do not know what it is with you and these pratical jokes but 
the attic room is locked 
look at all that uparkingu
i cannot believe this
i will bring the wine and the business plan  and lydia you will bring the ghosts
i cannot ubringu the ghosts  they are not here
they are not here anymore
just a minute maxie  somebody
i do not care from guilt  i just want to useeu them
are they suffering
any particular kind
do not you udareu
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon
it was not a joke
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you and you did not get scared 
that was the single most unattractive window treatment i have ever seen in the entire of my existence
is the rest of the house as bad as this
the rest of the house is probably worse  when can you and i get started
that is wrong
uoh my godu
otho i canunotu uliveu with these cheap domestic floor tiles
attic space
you do not have a key
maybe charles does
now lydia favor us about your ghosts
unou  do not encourage this little person
oh delia lighten up
look at that udetailu
are they still here otho
that is happening to them
are we going to be seeing you at miss shannongs boarding school

whistler i 
beautiful day is not it
how can you be out here
you are not going anywhere
who dies first
you are too human blade
is something wrong my friend
you are blind 
hold out your hands
i did not come here to get my palms read i need something translated
this is an old tongue from an old world it concerns lamagra
who is lamagra
the blood tide
yes the vampire apocalypse it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst
i am tired dawn is coming
but i just got here 
you should not be here
 he is a vampire
because you are tainted the venom's still inside you you could still turn on us
i cannot just leave i have a life here a career 
i can go to the police i have blood samples back at the hospital i can show them
do it you will be dead before you can file the complaint
how did you know
figured they would send someone after you thought i would wait around and see who showed up
you used me as bait
it worked did not it
but he could have 
but he is a policeman 
why in god's name would anyone want to work for them
because they are vampire wannabes if they are loyal if they prove themselves then their masters will turn them
and that is a good thing
what are you doing
you cannot do this he is human it is murder
there is no cure
what are you looking at
how can you tell
so many of them  i still cannot believe they are real
there are worse things than vampires out there
like what
what is this place
some kind of archive 
you are hurt 
what am i injecting you with
it is dark in here
i cannot close my eyes without hearing her scream
i made a trip to the hospital last night borrowed some equipment
my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart
any progress
some it is been slow 
you do not look so good
for what it is worth i am sorry
are you all right
i have been better 
how long have we been driving
is it bad
it will not work on you
get out of here 
i am not leaving without you
 tearing me  apart
i cannot  i will not be able to stop 
i never imagined i would be so happy to see the sun rise   it is over is not it
how is it going kam
you are a week early
whistler says i am building up a resistance to it
i was afraid that might happen
maybe it is time to start exploring other alternatives
but you  died 
deacon brought me back
how could you be a part of this
these are my people now i am one of them
you do not have to be
i wish you could see the world as i do deacon opened my eyes there's no turning back from that
i do not believe that
this is not human blood
then what is it
i thought you promised to give me some distance
five minutes not a second more and i do not want to hear a word about us
you have not started in on the internal organs
 but then i remember what an asshole you were and i am snapped back to reality
blade once again our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade he must be destroyed
i see and what would you have us do with this halfbreed
study him unlock the secrets of his dna he is the key we have been looking for
how do you like that right on time
i was wrong about you blade you were never one of us you are a traitor to your race
who are you people
consider it a parting gift vampire mace  silver nitrate essence of garlic
we keep in radio contact
why did not you tell me the truth about him
why do you hunt them
i had a family once  a wife three daughters then a drifter named deacon frost came calling one evening 
he killed them
how did you escape
and now you are using blade to exact your revenge
all right let's start with the basics  why do vampires need to drink blood
their own blood cannot sustain hemoglobin
what happened to the power
listen meurice you are gonna help me with a problem
you are gonna keep an eye on marty and ray make sure nothing happens
abby that is the matter
jesus i got a hangover want a drink
no i
for you i answer the door if you wanna stay here that is fine but i am retired
ray stole a shitload of money from marty until both of 'em calm down i am not getting involved
no meurice it is worse than that something really happened i think marty's dead
what did ray tell you that
what was that
why d'you wanna leave all this
drive me to a motel
you can stay at my place i will drop you there
where where you going

you can sleep on the bed if you want
well i am not gonna put you out of your bed
you would not be putting me out
i could have sworn i heard something
well i will be damned
he sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some
yeah what happened
psychiatrist said i was the healthiest person he would ever met so marty fired him
i do not know if you can fire a psychiatrist exactly
i said marty how come you are anal and i gotta go to the psychiatrist
when you do not they are usually nice
you ever get tired
abby you all right
ray what time is it
you all right
why did not you get into bed
well what happened
that is the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamnwhere the hell's my windbreaker
that is that is important
i i mean what are you talking about ray i have not done anything funny
that is going on with you two
where is everything
you leaving
but first i gotta know what happened
what do you want to know
i do not know was not it you maybe a burglar broke in and you found
you will not have to i will explain what a palate is
so how long have you know meurice

you get a refund though if you tell me who else she is been sluicing
i want that money if you wanna tell me something fine
what did you take these for
just doing my job
you called me i knew they were there so what do i need these for
well i do not know call it a fringe benefit
how long did you watch her

you want me to kill 'em
i did not say that  well
well what
what do you think
for the money
there's a big
yeah is it
what kind of fish
just the ten thousand will be fine

what did you do with the bodies
it is taken care of the less you know about it the better
something i got to ask you marty i have been very very careful have you been very very careful

it is too damn risky
count it if you want

how you doing mister d
it could have happened to anyone
before you ask there's nothing new on the coke
you have got to get me something i can use charlie
i have been waiting for you to get back
you got something on the coke
charlie  are you going to make a point soon
joanne braslow is getting more and more interesting  i followed her today to an attorney's office joseph koehler
joe koehler  i know him  he is an estate attorney  and he is very expensive
here it is  according to the old will joanne braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
take some time off
you think the da's gonna file on joanne
you did a good job charlie
i do not think that this is the time or the place
i just wanted to introduce myself and inform miss lawson that there will be an inquiry
an inquiry into what
what about the will
what would he die of
the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest
the official cause
that is what my report will read
cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want
doctor mccurdy what was the cause of death
a massive cardiac arrest
what was mr marsh's physical condition prior to his death
very poor  he was suffering from severe arterial disease
what induced it
we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood
so mr marsh used cocaine
i do not think so  the membrane in his nasal passage did not show any sign of long time usage
your honor the state enters this evidence as exhibit a  were any fingerprints found on the bottle
yes  those of mr marsh and a thumb print of miss lawsongs
dr mccurdy what would cocaine do to someone in mr marsh's condition
increase his heart rate
 and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine
it would be an added stress to his heart
what would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to mr marsh and then induced him to make love
it would be the same as shooting a gun at him
did miss lawson and mr marsh ever argue
like cats and dogs
did you ever see mr marsh use cocaine
no  never
your honor mr roston is an exlover of miss lawsongs
why did not the state's investigation uncover mr roston earlier
he was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago
objection sustained
no questions
objection your honor
that is it  my client does not have to take this crap from you
can you
take your pole out of the water frank  the fish ai not biting today
she planned this  she wanted us to find the nasal spray
she is innocent
are not they all
your honor i fail to see what mrs crawford's educational background has to do with this case
i am just curious to see if mr troxell reconstructed anything else
i have got work to do
hey  the bell's sounded  it is between rounds
you do not know what you are talking about
really  what does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning
you have been following me
your honor i do not see a mr roston listed as a prosecution witness
i will rephrase the question  mr roston is not it true you are bisexual
objection  may i remind mr dulaney that the person on trial here is miss lawson  not dr paley
can i go
miss lawson do you use cocaine
i have
did you use it the night marsh died
miss braslow  i am district attorney john cardenas  you arrived at what time tonight
a little after eleven
why did you come by
i had some papers to pick up
do you know who mr marsh was with
her name
rebecca lawson
you would not know her address would you
no  but i can get it for you
how long were you mr marsh's personal secretary
six years
did you ever see mr marsh use cocaine
no  never
tell the court about that please
i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial
how did he look
horrible  he was tired and pale
who found him
his secretary  joanne braslow
she was here
no  she stopped by to pick up some papers
doctor trammel when did you first diagnose that mr marsh had heart disease
about a year and half ago
did mr marsh change his lifestyle after that
yes  he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly
just one last question  what does the sign on your office door say
mr roston what was your relationship with miss lawson
we were lovers
how long were you together
for about one year
what kind of condition are you referring to
what happened next
i had bypass surgery
and how are you now
fine  the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man
how did your relationship with miss lawson progress after the surgery
it did not
why not
why did she say she was leaving
she did not  she just left
why do you think she left you
when you say your sexual relations with miss lawson were intense what exactly do you mean
it was like she was trying to push me as far as she could  she called it opening new doors
it is hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is
mr roston i know this is difficult for you but it is important you tell the court what she did
what happened after that
i woke up the next morning and she was gone
who was your primary beneficiary
she was
where did you meet miss lawson
at a dinner party  about eight months ago
did you ever see her again after that
yes  several times
what eventually happened to your relationship with miss lawson
did you suggest any
yes  insulin and others
dr paley where were you the last time you saw miss lawson
well  as i remember it we had an argument
you will be sorry
no  she asked me about cocaine
you can suggest anything you want it happened
i may have been infatuated with her   but i would not perjure myself
i am sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked
then you have no way of knowing what mr marsh told miss lawson were the reasons for his visits
dr wong  what type of medicine do you practice
oriental medicine
and is miss lawson a patient of yours
yes  i have been seeing her for over a year
why does she come to you
what did you prescribe for her
chinese peony root
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like
i heard him say it
where did you meet him
i am a nurse  i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital  dr paley's on staff there
what was the nature of your relationship with dr paley
we dated for about a month last year
did he make your life miserable
what did he say
he laughed  and basically said he would decide when it was over
what happened
i worked for mr marsh for six years he was a good man  until she came along
what about miss lawson
how do you know it was cocaine that miss lawson had in the bathroom
what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial
could you repeat the last part of what mr marsh said to you the day before his death
yes  he mentioned it
so the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving  that must cause tremendous anxiety sleepless nights  incredible stress
i do not know  i am not sure
well think about it  is not it possible
who told you that
he video taped you
that bastard
i have been to a few  yes
she talked him into it  she wanted everything
there's an item you picked up that is marked  will you read it
dristan nasal spray
would you read for us the time of the purchase
three fifteen
is not it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle
then why did you go see mr koehler in the first place
hi joe
frank  what are you doing here
i need to ask you a question  what made you get in touch with joanne braslow
you know i cannot talk about that
do you think i did it
he will file  he is an ambitious man ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others
no pain no gain
something like that
i think we are getting a little off the subject here
i thought the subject was sex
i do not know if it is something i can explain to you
why not
if you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard
can we get out of here
this is your house

that seems so far away from who you are now  what happened
i broke my ankle skating  that ended that dream

what would
you and me  making love
is that what you think i was thinking
there's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me frank
i just left joanne braslow  she told me she saw you doing cocaine at marsh's house
she is mistaken
that is not good enough goddamit
i do not use cocaine anymore  if she says she saw me doing it she is lying

i called you all weekend  where were you
you were brilliant today
can i see you later

i am glad you have such confidence in me
do not worry about paley  he cannot touch me  no one can  i have thought it all out
rebecca  take these off
what are you going you doing
that is that for
to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today
rebecca  we shattered a mangs life in open court

i swear  the both of you  some example you set
how can cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults
he must have something or he would not be pressing so hard
if he files are you going to take the case
i do not know yet  i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow
that is she like
she sounds like quite a woman
i will talk to him later
why do not you talk to him now

that is wrong
sharon it is late  can we get to the point

we cannot pretend this is not happening
please  not now

lady do not let him do it
you got it wrong  i am the one that is on your side

or relieve me of it later
you missed
how do we get back to the freeway
can you make him stop
he is seen both of us now
look i have got a wife  i do not care if either of you ever get caught
it took you long enough to get my ass out
with all those holes nels pumped in i knew you would not suffocate
now turn around  i am going to cuff you
put those away  we cannot have marks on his wrists
you never miss a trick
you switched license plates
that is your rep
what do you mean tip the cops  is the man a lunatic or what
just hand up on the bitch  fuck you madam  and goodbye
i do not like anybody laying their hands on me
just like they say no fucking self control
if you know that just back off
shit  there's the hotel  you overshot the driveway
and stop with the directions
we still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby
got your badge
satisfied wiseass
in any event whatever occurs you do not belt anybody
okay okay lenore calm down either let me call the school or better yet the fbi
i thought you said you could handle him
nels do not let that cop pass you
lose the hardware now
do not fuck around  pop a cap in him
he took it like a man  toss him in that drainage ditch
i am still in my cab  jammed up in traffic  are you there yet
any minute
i was worried about you  both of you
we have had our share of fuckups but it is going to work out fine
do i know you
i have been trying to get someone  anyone  for hours 
if this is some sales pitch i am not buying 
will you let me explain
and what are you whispering for
lady try making some sense
you may be our only chance  i do not know if i can do this again
what would you do  just pick my number out of the air
they smashed the phone  i have been clicking the loose wires together hoping it would make a connection
who smashed the phone
they are holding my husband downstairs
i am sorry  i am so sorry to do this to you
you are not doing anything to me  because  listen to this carefully  i do not care
i do not believe you
you are the one who's not to be believed
my name is 
i do not want to know 
my name is lenore oberfeld
do not expect me to tell you who i am
i realize you do not want to be involved
i am not involved  keep clicking your little wires  you will get someone else  good luck
you will not disconnect
oh will not i
because you know you will be killing us
do not lay this on me
well is not there a number on the goddam phone
the cops could trace this call back to you
one of them uisu a cop
elliot  our driver  the officer put his gun to the back of elliot's head and  fired  it was so quick
oh man  these people mean business
then they took the mercedes away  with his body in it
no do not  you could lose me for good  do not go through that tunnel
i am with two friends now
rachel  they are going after rachel now  and i cannot stop them
stop throwing names at me
rachel my daughter  she is an honor student at parker  my god she is only nine
what do they need her for
they know jack will give them what they want once they have her
the bigger man is driving our mercedes to the school  rachel will recognize the car  she will get right in
let me call the school  tell them not to let her go
forget who i am  where is this school located
26th off wilshire
even if i got there first she would not go with me
why is not anyone answering me
will you please speak to me theo
hello  it is just me and you again
what about the others
i kind of dropped them off  they were getting on my nerves
what are you doing now
what do you think i am doing  i am on my way to the school like you wanted
forget about us  just save rachel
where is the fucking recharger cord  must be in her car dammit
how much time do you have left on it
i do not know  80 or 90 minutes tops
a woman
hey drop it okay
and that was the end of it
i sure as hell got my wish  she does not exist  so maybe you reached the appropriate person after all
i am sorry if i caused you to lose your business deal
what do you do for a living
sometimes i paint
i did not mean to insult you you are an artist
i suppose if you are a struggling artist you need a patron
lady you do not have to keep up a running commentary
i did not mean to  it is just the way i am
a price on everything
i was not always like that  i do not think i was
i am about ten blocks from the school
i have no right to ask for help i have never thought of anybody but myself
that makes two of us
there are cables overhead  hang on  it will clear up
make a right  you cannot miss it
lenore i am here  i am getting out
i can hear you again clearly
does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail
that is happening
she is gone 
do not say anything  do not alarm them  just go
he is copying down my license  for all the good it will do him
it is not your fault theo  you tried
i should have put them out of the car and come sooner
you said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box
the one in brentwood
what bank
wait just a minute  our luck has changed
what do you mean
which means you cannot be more than five or ten minutes from here
not a chance
do not say that
do you know that is in that box
they will recognize it is not your husband
jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago
they have still got to be able to sign his name
it is not hard to do  i do it all the time
you are doing what you can  why's all this money stashed
to hide it from the irs
how come everybody turns out to be a crook
do not talk  do not talk
that is going on
it will not be him
theo i want you to know you are probably the most decent man i have ever met
yeah sure that is me  ask anybody
but i guess we have not really met  have we
why tell me this
because you are probably the last person i will ever talk to
did you hear that click
yes  i think so  another crossed line
or somebody else there is listening in 
downstairs  there must be an extension  oh my god 
no  i hear them  they are coming upstairs  they know
yes  yes
hi lenore  it is me  i got you back  courtesy of star 69  are you hurt
they dragged me downstairs  i thought they were going to kill me
lucky for them they did not
what did you do
i had a little encounter at the bank and our mr transplant ended up under the wheels of a chevy
thank you  god bless you for helping us
are you okay
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles
now you are going to do just what i tell you to  no discussion  no hesitation
yes sir
i am not leaving my daughter behind  not with them
she is next  in two or three more minutes she will be free
i cannot do it
can you walk
yes  but i want rachel to come with me
they will not allow that  it is one at a time  and you have to be first
all right  now that you explain it i see that you are right
once you are in the car with me she is sure to come to us
rachel  oh my god
it is locked
rachel was terrified when i left her  i could see it in her eyes
she will be with you soon  they are pulling up  they will realize i kept my part of the bargain
she will never be the same  none of us will
now i have  it is a long story
why did not you just shoot them
because a lot of people would have gotten killed  probably all the wrong ones
you are going to let them get away with this
we have almost got your husband and your daughter out  so do not get any ideas
they tortured us  and you are going to let them have all that money
so far they are keeping their part of it
they put their hands all over me
he had a gun  i have it now
why are you telling him that  are you crazy
you are not lenore oberfeld
there is not any such person
whose money is this
it belongs to the man you took it from  or should i saw ustoleu it from
the guy with the transplant
jack oberfeld in person  did you kill him
damned if i know
the video cameras will put you with him in the bank and i will bet there were enough witnesses
at least one
plus they will remember you going after his daughter at school
you timed that beautifully
they always pick rachel up early on thursday
i got what i fucking deserved  i had it all  i could have kept going
as they say  no good deed goes unpunished
and all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop 
i thought it was inspired
sit completely still with both hands on the wheel  until they get here
why pick me to be your mark
nobody's easier to con than a con man
your friends are probably still on the line  pick it up and say hello
there's no way out for you  you have to deal with us
tell them i am keeping that is left i earned it  i probably killed some poor bastard for it
do you have to point that
absolutely  and topanga canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if i recall
he seems to be headed for topanga
i am not trying to lose them  nor am i exceeding any speed limits
the one thing you do not want is to attract the police
granted the cops are not an alternative  certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk
a typical fuckup
that is that supposed to me
i knew you were a loser the first night i laid eyes on you
you were at the emerald that night
naturally you did not learn your lesson
now you are starting to sound like a victim again
you could have hit me
only in the leg or the thigh you would live but you just would not wear shorts
i am still okay
inform him the fee is seventyfive large for your return  all parts intact
did you hear that
do you think they will walk away
they will have units blocking us up ahead
that is why we are turning off onto a fire road
that is happening
i cannot hear  now there's a siren  they must be in an ambulance  what about the money  nels
wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed
any idea where you are going
i was sentenced to a youth camp out here when i was fourteen  we cleared some of these same roads
developer ran out of money years back  i would hate to think about that is living in there
yeah i was waiting for that suggestion
sooner or later you will learn to trust me
that is really on your wicked little mind
the cop in the trunk  he could still be alive
that is a reasonable possibility
he might have heard everything we said in the car
that is your point
we cannot leave him to repeat anything
which one of us is elected to do the deed
maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us
that is not good enough
i am handling it
both hands on your lap
some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me
took preparation
exactly who was this oberfeld
know what else is in here
think about that is going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per
you will not live to see it
it is going to be some fucking snowstorm
five  six
i picked the wrong number when i chose you  did not i
i have got  one last number for you theo 
sure like i am gonna take advice from you
thank god  thank god i have got you
who is this
oh god  oh no  help me  do not let me  die
did not we play this scene before
do not leave me here to die  theo please  you cannot let me die 
who are you working for
i am self employed  what kind of cut did the hairy one have
twenty percent
fine  i want half  plus the release of the family
they saw you kill the driver
you are walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to id you
there are no guarantees in this life
where do we meet
a large stretch of empty space with no place to hide  temescal canyon parking lot
what time frame have you got in mind
it should take me twenty minutes where are you coming from
some loyalty
there's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass
tell the lady to relax  tell her i cannot wait to meet her in person
she is somewhat damaged in the shipping  but nothing makeup will not cover
beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot
you are getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular
i am here  where are you
we do not see you
i am three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand
stay there
i do not want you within two hundred feet  park down by the lifeguard station  nobody gets out
it is your call
fucking a it is  any argument and i am out of here
just relax
i do not need to relax  the woman put her on
you will see her
i do not want to see her later  i want to hear her unowu
you already tried to pull one little number on me  and it did not work
i do not know what you mean
her husband said there would be one million eight  so nine hundred to you
you will still have the girl and the husband
and they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van
are you trying to panic the women
that is how it is  you see her approaching you toss out installment one
stop the crying
she is yours  what are we waiting on
count it
seems like it
yeah  why do not we
that is he doing  answer me
who am i talking to
if you are looking for a quickie all you have got to do is ask
if he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus lenore here
and if you ditch us we get zilch
you are going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked
you researched me  you know where i live  she will be waiting for you there along with your split
and i end up in a fucking neck brace for life
i just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting rodriego
nels  guess who  a friendly voice from beyond the grave
who's this
i thought you would know me by now
what does it take to kill you
i suppose you are in your taxi
why would she want me to think you were on ice
intelligent question nels  i believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity
that bitch  that is keeping you from taking off
i can see the benefit in that
in the hills above sunset  just below the getty
how far off are you
five minutes
have your cab wait at the foot of cisco  we will ride up together
and make ourselves a hell of a target
we are gonna get there first
how do you know
better haul ass if we are gonna be inside to greet them
i have got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards
somebody better tear this down before it falls down
who were you talking to
them  they will not be expecting us
brilliant  unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away  in which case you just warned them
i am in awe
since when did you guys start changing tires
only you udo notu have a flat
seems not
if you were not going for a spare what were you doing
something was rattling around some loose tools
why are you picking on me for
was i picking on you  how come you pulled in back of this fruitstand
who are you
let me talk to the lady again
hold on
if her kid or her old man have been harmed we have also got nothing to talk about
i already called for an ambulance

do you remember telling me once that all through my career i would never fit in  well
you were right of course  but after
always done richard
do you think i have not seen the bodies of those
men every time i have closed my eyes  but after you went away i

ians  but i assure you leo
i lost all my squeamishness at leav 
enworth  i will have no compunction at all about using this
hm  the wind's northwest  that oughta beseattle

and do not give him any ice cream
like april  it gives him gas and make sure there's  two pots of coffee
 two pots of coffee
ready before the morning crowd blows in

like a fish
 no that is not possible mason  the trout 
is a perfect hunter
he is brains without ambition
sensitivity without neurosis  he is
the master of his realm
how can we ever hope to win against the trout
there's only one way you can do it mason
turn the power of the hunter against him
tie a fly
create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive
and that power
without caution
is death
some people might say you are reading an awful lot in
the compound has to be kept cold
 or it will ignite 
cold  cold  how cold
never let it reach fifty degredegrees
and what if it does
you are the only one i can trust
 the only one who understands what this me
yeah i just
trying to remember something somebody once told me about tying a fly
and only then does our noble friend realize
that the prey can bite back
mr sweeney how goes it
well  costello's finished with the stability profile but abbott is still chewing on the load file
so reaction temperature is fifty degrees
well your prediction was on the nose
how much longer for the range and power projections
 i do not know  um he is working but there's a lot of data maybeanother hour
dr  long
you mason
what we gave brynner on the dam was a phony
we have got the real thing
there's a vent shaft leading straight up

uh drifting around like the trash you are or were you here working
if it was wednesday night i was working

look at that
barney who is this bimbo he a regular customer
'course you do jake
an honest living
i will settle for la county
how come all these new names are pasted into the plat book
then these are all new owners

but that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months
if that is what it says
can i check one of these volumes out
sir this is not a lending library it is the hall of records
well then how about a ruler
a ruler
i said horseshit  horseshit
it does not hurt
but i am surprised you are still working for her unless she is suddenly come up with another husband
how did she get that idea
fine as long as you do not serve chicken that way
tell me what do the police say
they are calling it an accident
who's the investigating officer
lou escobar  he is a lieutenant
do you know him
oh yes
where from
we worked in chinatown together

why is that funny
it is what the da used to tell me about chinatown
exactly what do you know about me mr gittes
his girlfriend
yes his girlfriend
you mean the little chippie he was with at the el macando
does not that strike you as odd
no she is probably scared to death
if mulwray was murdered she was probably one of the last people to see him
i have got the photographs in my office if they will help you remember what was the argument about
my daughter
hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune we were a lot closer than evelyn realized
if you want to hire me i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about
well she is an extremely jealous person i did not want her to find out about the girl
how did you find out
just find the girl
i will look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves
avocado groves
well you do not look any the worse for wear mr gittes i must say where is the girl
i have got her
is she all right
she is fine
where is she
i would like you to look at something mr cross
what is it
an obituary column can you read in this light
what does this mean
the coroner's report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs
hollie was always fond of tidepools you know what he used to say about them

how much are you worth
i have no idea how much do you want
i want to know what you are worth over ten million

do you remember the figures we discussed
of course i do where are you
at your daughter's house how soon can you get here

is it i forget i do not call myself that often
yeah i took 'em so what
i want the rest of the pictures

mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody did not want his body found in the ocean
and why's that
what are you talking about
it is too late
too late for what
i know what he says
i do not suppose you got any idea where she went
her maid's house i think she knows something's up
that is the maid's address
she lives in pedro i will write it down for you
no gittes you will show us
what for
if she is not there you are going downtown and you are staying there til she shows up
gee lou i am doing the best i can
well let's go
you never learn do you gittes
i guess not
give you three minutes
mrs mulwray you do not want to run around like that
oh christ escobar you do not know that is going on let her go i will explain it later
mrs mulwray it is a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law it is a felony
let her go she did not kill anybody
i am sorry mrs mulwray
lou she will kill you let her go for now you do not know
who is he get his name i will kill him
take it easy take it easy it was an accident
get him away from her he is responsible for everything get him away from her
it looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel could he swim
of course
well it did not make him happy
do you know where she might be
but i thought you would hired a private investigator
a private investigator
mr gittes
would you like something to drink
what are you having
iced tea
my husband's at the office
actually he is not and he is moved from his apartment at the el macando
i am just trying to make a living and i do not want to become a local joke
so let's just drop the whole thing sugar  lemon
mrs mulwray
yes mr gittes
i should talk this over with your husband
why what on earth for  look hollis seems to think you are an innocent man
what do you mean
may i speak frankly mrs mulwray
suppose they did how does it concern you
nothing personal mrs mulwray i just 
no i went riding rather early
i will stop by
mrs mulwray mrs mulwray
just a minute
you left your keys in the ignition
i got your check in the mall
mrs mulwray i am afraid that is not good enough
well how much would you like
stop it the money's fine it is generous but you have shortchanged me on the story
i have
i think so something besides your husband's death was bothering you you were upset but not that upset
it was not much of a lie
if your husband was killed it was  this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence
well i suppose i am actually i knew about the affair
how did you find out
my husband
and you were not the slightest bit upset about it
unless what
i do not like the word 'cheat'
did you have affairs
mr gittes
is there anything else you want to know
where you were when your husband died
i cannot tell you
you mean you do not know where you were
i mean i cannot tell you
k cross
that your maiden name
yes why
you must have had a reason to ask me that
no i am just a snoop
you seem to have had a reason for every other question
no not for that one
how did it happen
been meaning to talk to you about that
maybe putting your nose in other people's business
another satisfied client
oh no i have got my own car the creamcolored packard
wait a minute sonny  i think you better come with me
whoever's behind my husband's death why have they gone to all this trouble
your father is julian cross is not he
yes of course it was quite a while after i was just out of grade school when they did that
is there something upsetting about my asking about your father
no yes a little you see hollis and my fa my father had a falling out
over the water department or over you
not over me why would they have a falling out over me
oh yeah
yes he never forgave him for it
never forgave him for what
for talking him into building it he never forgave my father they have not spoken to this day
you sure shout that
of course i am sure
that dam is a con job
the valley
jasper lamar crabb
know him
and hollis knew about it
we got it we got it baby
what what is it
there was a memorial service at the mar vista inn today for jasper lamar crabb he died three weeks ago
is that unusual
you are looking at the owners of a 50000 acre empire
they cannot be
i will stay
what do you mean 'why' nobody's here that is all
i gave everybody the night off
easy it is an innocent question
no question from you is innocent mr gittes
tell me something does this usually happen to you mr gittes
actually this has not happened to me in some time
it was in chinatown
what were you doing there
working for the district attorney
as little as possible
the district attorney gives his men advice like that
so why does it bother you to talk about it chinatown
hold still why
you cannot always tell that is going on there
no why was it
i thought i was keeping someone from being hurt and actually i ended up making sure they were hurt
that is wrong
your eye
what about it
there's something black in the green part of your eye
oh that it is a flaw in the iris
a flaw
just i have to
and i want to know where
please do not be angry believe me it is got nothing to do with you
the albacore club
it has to do with my father
i know
he owns it you know
i saw him
you saw my fa father when
this morning
you did not tell me
what did he say  what did he say
that you were jealous and he was worried about what you might do
do to who
give me an example
you may think you know that is going on but you do not
that is what your father said you are telling me he is in back of this whole thing
it is possible
okay give me the keys
you bastard
it is either that or you drive to the police yourself
the police
c'mon mrs mulwray you have got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there
she is not tied up
you know what i mean you are keeping her there against her will
i am not
she is too upset
that is not what it looks like mrs mulwray
what does it look like
like she knows about hollis' death like she knows more than you want her to tell
you will not go to the police if i tell you
i cannot
i took your husband's buick  i will return it tomorrow

it is personal has he been out long
since lunch
gee whiz  and i am late

well i am on my lunch hour i will wait
he is liable to be tied up indefinitely
julian cross worked for the water department
yes no
he did or he did not
how did they get it away from him
mr mulwray felt the public should own the display the water if you will just read the display
mulwray i thought you said cross owned the department
along with mr mulwray
they were partners
they got into a terrific argument outside the pig 'n whistle
what about
i do not know the traffic was pretty loud i only heard one thing  apple core
jesus christ walsh that is what you spent your day doing
look you tell me to take pictures i take pictures
look jake she gave us mulwray's real phone number and address
all she needed for that was the phone book
no no she said not to call her husband might answer

yes  i thought it was a good idea we have covered it from the news end of course

i have got more than a right as far as you are concerned susan
oh i am sick and tired of you telling me what i must and what i mus not do
you will never have another chance to hit me again  i never knew till this minute

let's not start all over again charlie  we have said everything that can be said
mr kane how can i persuade you

i came to see you charles about your  about the enquirer's campaign against the metropolitan transfer company
get dr corey
mrs kane would like to see you mr kane
is mrs kane  
close the door raymond
yes sir 
do you like poetry raymond

oh yes sir
do you know what that is
it is a wall you bought in china mr kane
persia  it belonged to a king
how did you get him to part with it mr kane
he was dead  that is a poem  do you know what it means
no i do not mr kane
it is been a tough day
the chronicle is a good newspaper
well gentlemen are we going to war
you do not want to be a war correspondent  how about being a dramatic critic
do you think you are the one who should call him a great man
why not
because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the enquirer in his pocket
 and that copy of the enquirer said the president should be killed
i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death 
you have said a lot of things about the president in the last few months
i have got to think of emily 
i would like to talk to you about that
first of all  
that is wrong brad
i am drunk
charlie it is just no go  we cannot agree anymore  i wish you would let me go to chicago
i will tell you what i will do brad  i will get drunk too  maybe that will help
all right
why is she leaving me
she has not any friends left sine you started this oil business and she never sees you
do you think the enquirer should not have campaigned against the oil leases
are you finished
that is all right  what are you going to do about emily
i know you will
hello brad
maybe we would better wait for more word on the president's condition
we will withdraw support completely anything else
mr leland sent back that check
what check
you made it out to him last week after he left for chicago
oh yes the bonus
i will sign those papers 
it is going to be done exactly the way i have told mr thatcher 
well let's hope it is all for the best
sorry mr thatcher  what the kid needs is a good thrashing
that is this
it is a letter from her lawyers
david grobleski & davis   my dear rawlston  
rawlston is my boss
oh yes  i know about mr rawlston
brief marriage  ten years 
on your way out stop at a cigar store will you and send me up a couple of cigars
sure mr leland  i will be glad to

i am not going to faint but if i want to faint i will faint okay
mouthtomouth which could maybe
which could maybe what
maybe lead to a flare up
a flare up
flare up of old emotions
listen to you  the old mouthtomouth resuscitation routine huh
from one professional to another of course

dr arroway 
michael kitz national security advisor
hope there's a cartoon
what in the hell
 or 'you are our kind of people '
now i remember why i went into theoretical work  kent
glad to have you david  how is the new office
nothing  okay  some of us have been a little not concerned exactly but
tell me
i am willing to take that risk
you are 
i disagree
pepsi  tequila
peter sends his regards
oh  how is he doing
very well since my appointment he is been made interim director
really  congratulations by the way
i am surprised you even knew it was an election year
'president's science advisor'  so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now
now exactly  it is complicated
you cannot just pull the plug david
i am searching for patterns in the noise that is all  order in the chaos  i am practicing listening 
no you are not  but the price has just gotten too high
 could it be a nested code of some sort
throw a gray scale on it standard interpolation
 arrangements also have to be made for the vips coming in mostly religious leaders
with me
what is it  that is happened
we have cracked it  lunacharsky found it
you mean 
do you have a minute  
actually i am running late 
you are not staying
this seemed best
right  well
what would you have me say david
nothing  i guess i just wanted to thank you
thank you
what does it say
because you cut it from the budget three years running
dr lunacharsky
in ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing it was called a palimpsest
there's no way of knowing  without a key  a primer to help us maybe never
no primer
j39 z186
been there done that got the tshirt
got a bogey boss
hydrogen times pi  got it  strong sucker
that cannot be right it is only twentysix light years away
how is the spying tonight guys
dr cullers
kent kent for chrissakes  you must be eleanor
ellie  pulsar
191921  found a glitch in the timing probably a starquake
here right around centaurus a
it is beautiful
you have only searched  what is it sixteen hundred stars without a peep  try not to take it too personally
okay let's just slow down  pull up the starfield signal origin
cannot we get rid of them
i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot
i am saying you might have consulted us the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive
 which we will also need the network's help to receive and decode
colonel jarrod i would like a twenty mile radiosilent perimeter put around this installation immediately
and a hundred mile airspace
is that your official response
i do not have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right
in fact by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible
please answer the question doctor
is it possible  yes  but 
thank you doctor  now 
small moves captain small moves
i cannot move any smaller
talk to him
but what do i say
could we hear to china
on that old shortwave  maybe on a clear night  come on now under the covers
could we hear to the moon
big enough radio i do not see why not
could we hear god
mmm that is a good one  maybe his echo  okay no more stalling
i am sorry i could not be there for you sweetheart
you are not real  none of this is
that is my scientist
so  are you an hallucination  or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin
so who  what  are you
originally just another species like yourselves  well not like you at all actually but
can you show me
small moves captain small moves
why did you contact us
you contacted us  we were simply listening  we have been listening for millions of years
and those other docking ports i saw i mean there are others
many others
so who
we do not know  whoever they were they were gone long before we ever got here
the scale it is just  so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here
not all  some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams  some never make it this far
am i one or many
you always have been  we are all descendants of the same stars ellie  all made of the same primordial atoms
so  what happens now
now you go home
eventually you will get here on your own  this was just the first step in time you will take another
but  other people from our planet should see what i have seen  they should witness this for themselves
that is not the way it works
but you said you wanted to help  do not you see what it would mean
it is time to go home now
no  please
why am i here mr hadden
the infamous unfashionable bluntness  you are here so we can do business i want to make a deal
if i knew you any better i would say that does not sound like you
a pagebreak signal  a period
a sunrise and a sunset every forty five minutes
that is that
it looks like pixie dust  kent would have given anything to see this  david too
yes  a shame  still it would be worse if they died for nothing
you sound like joseph  you think the world ends with the millennium
i think whoever sent the message did it because they are worried about us
the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us
hokkaido island
the systems integration site
he is an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life
ellie  arroway
peter valerian
'any sufficiently advanced technology'
how close are you to getting this funding put together
it is almost there  the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time
what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico
the vla
we could be together again 
i am going on staff at the nsf  to work for drumlin
it is good to see you ellie
someone tell me this is really happening
it is really happening
that you valerian
like it or not
ellie  are you okay
wait  hold on a minute 
it is all right the important thing is you are safe 
peter what are you talking about what malfunction  what day is this
what day
champagne please
i would say logic more than faith  the odds were on my side
and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you
i guess i would have felt sorry for the universe
spoken like a true believer
what about you  does not all of this shake your faith at all
how do you mean
well it is been a while but i do not recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations
your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger only smaller
and you believe this law with all your heart and soul
and mind yes  what are you 
i flinched
do you love your parents
i never knew my mother  my father died when i was nine
did you love him
yes  very much
so  is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this
some of my best friends are scientists
i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors
some of my best friends are scientists  they are saying the machine is alive
not exactly  it has organic qualities but we do not really understand how they are integrated with the mechanical systems
maybe you are creating a monster
in other words god is one hell of an engineer
if you came back
if you came back you would only be four years older  but over 50 years would have passed on earth
something like that
if you came back  if you survived at all  which it is pretty certain you would not
you are willing to die for this
losing faith  the search for meaning in the age of reason catchy
did you ever stop to think that maybe that is not science's fault but meaning's
do you really believe your life is meaningless
it is getting late
an excellent question doctor  but what if we do not like the answer
ellie the last time we spoke i said some things
so  the final countdown
the final countdown
you are trembling
i do seem to be maybe because i am just a little bit terrified about tomorrow
i am sorry
ellie what is it
i cannot do this 
what are you so afraid of
please palmer  if you care for me at all do not push this now 
i am in love with you ellie
do not you understand  i just have to hold it together  just until tomorrow 
and then what  then you will be safe
i cannot hear this now 
i am assuming you read my deposition
it was quite a page turner
so  i am assuming they sent you here to administer last rites
i am not sure it is come to that
they do not believe me
i do not have any proof palmer
in other words god works in mysterious ways
you have a question dr arroway
i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed  basically announcing our intentions are hostile
oh my god
where were you
in the private aircraft hangar anybody could have walked in
did you come
no what about your camera girl did she come
there that is better
if i groundloop during my flying lesson on saturday you might wake up and find me next to you

that is going well then
and her husband what was he
where is the car
outside in the visitors car park
what they brought the car here
my car not yours yours is a complete wreck the police dragged it to the pound behind the station
have you seen it
the sergeant asked me to identify it he did not believe you would gotten out alive
it is about time

you should have gone to the funeral
i wish i had they bury the dead so quickly  they should leave them lying around for months
what about his wife the woman doctor have you visited her yet
renata tells me you are going to rent a car
i cannot sit on this balcony forever i am beginning to feel like a potted plant
how can you drive james your legs you can barely walk
is the traffic heavier now there seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident
i have never really noticed is renata going with you
i thought she might come along handling a car again might be more tiring than i imagine
i am amazed that she will let you drive her
it does
do you find him attractive
he is very pale covered with scars
would you like to tuck him though in that car
no but when he is in that car
have you seen his penis
they are questioning vaughan about an accident near the airport some pedestrian they think he was run over intentionally
you would better drive him he is a bit shaky i will follow in my car where is yours

i thought that was you up there
one of your suitors
the traffic where is everyone they have all gone away

i will wear a bloody kimono if i want to
so  why the airport
do you want a cigarette i started to smoke at the hospital it is rather stupid of me
who is that the announcer do i know him
is this part of the act or are they really hurt
and you had sex with all of these men in cars only in cars
yes i did not plan it that way
and did you fantasize that vaughan was photographing all these sex acts as though they were traffic accidents
there's still a patch of blood there on the road did you see it
i saw the blood it looks like motor oil
you were the last one i saw just before the accident do you remember we made love

well ma'am the truth is i gave them to amy hersolf to post
and amy mailed them
i like to see her happy
to daddy from amy here's one for miss callahan this one says to edward from amy
something to do with a butterfly they were quarreling about it
no amy slapped donald because he had hurt the butterfly  and it was her friend
well that seems a harmless fancy 
but we have she is wanted for nothing
it all starts with them going to the bathroom together
that many women in one place  nothing good can come from that
i am lucky jengs not like that
waiter she needs more water
no way is that the same chick the other one was a dog
jennifer gave her a makeover
guess you like those coyote ugly steaks now huh
sorry i did not recognize you earlier you look so different
you should not smoke it will kill you
james dean humphrey bogart
yul brynner they are all dead
wow your body's really hot
i have been working out
i mean body temperature do you have a fever
a bite where would you get bitten
there was a sale
i mean where on your body
a dog at victoria's secret
how is the rest of your health
pms what symptoms are you experiencing
it is hard to describe i get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and
that is just part of being a woman diet and exercise should help avoid salt sugar starches caffeine alcohol
that bite healed up quickly it is been about three weeks
nearly four
we are worried about you 60 minutes was on samesex couples
what does that have to do with me
you have not mentioned dating anyone since mark and well you are not a lesbian are you
no i am not a lesbian geez mom
i have cramps i cannot believe i let you talk me into this
come on we have been double dating since the fourth grade
yeah even then look what happened michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me
well that is not going to happen tonight george said carltongs a nice guy
translation a total geek
anything's better than mark
i guess i have a weakness for him it is those big brown bambi eyes
i wonder what it is like being you being noticed all the time
he has not said one word to me
maybe he is just shy
my date always pays more attention to you than to me
frida i do not mean this as a criticism but you might not want to talk about pms around men
sorry it is just so bad lately you are so lucky you never get pms
i get a little bloated sometimes
do you really need these
only to see
cannot you get contacts
no it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye
or if there's a full moon
where are all the mediums
can you believe she fucking bit me
and she got the medium
george bit you
maybe they have to pee
are you kidding he might as well say can i date rape you
where where do you think a mustache would be look
i do not see anything maybe just a little
hey did you get contacts
he is dead am i bad luck or what
there you go blaming yourself for everything again
and he was ripped limb from limb
i am sure they were exaggerating
why would they exaggerate
so did you do it
did i kill him of course not
no did you fuck him
no i do not think so
did you get smashed or what you have to eat if you are drinking and not just those little salads
i ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with gregory
and then
i think i went in and fell asleep i guess gregory walked home and got killed i blacked out
at least your pms is over
i thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses
are those mark's
no mark wears boxers they must have been in the dryer already
he was cute huh of course whenever i meet a guy i am wearing no makeup
rule one always wear makeup
gross so this is mark's flesh when did you see him
um he stopped by yesterday before you came over
why did not you tell me you said you had not seen him for a month
i am sorry i did not want you to think i was still a doormat
i do not think i have ever actually liked anyone i have dated before peter even likes me without makeup
hmmm sounds suspicious
i do not know much about him how do you know if a guy is decent
give him the tampon test
i am freaking out i am like an animal and totally out of control my arms keep getting really hairy
you have to stop being so self critical frida
how would it go with the cop
okay i guess so
i started out on that eyeofnewt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate
well whatever it was seems to have worked cause you look great
what did he say
charming carlton
geez i wish i would get it like that
oh my god look my arms are so hairy
yes they are look how much more hair i have than you
it is just cause mine is finer a little bleach will fix that
frida this is a bad time we are having sex and george actually answered the phone
jennifer a severed arm it is bloody and i am not sure but it may be carltongs
you fucked carlton see i told you he liked you
so where is this infamous arm now
i put it down the garbage disposal
it took me an hour to clean it up that was not in my head
maybe the blood was from your period like before
i have not gotten it yet
frida listen to yourself if i said i was a werewolf would you believe me
frida i was worried to death about you i have called you for two days where have you been
i have been here what day is it
tuesday are you okay
shit i guess i missed work
frida carltongs dead
oh no
and he was missing an arm
get rid of him
okay i gotta go
holy shit i do not know
did you get rid of mark
i do not know i am spaced out he was taking a shower he must be still in there
he is been here all night
what happened to his tooth
i should call the police oh no peter peter is the police
do not call the police
why not there's been a murder
first of all you are my alibi i told george i was with you last night
what why would you do that
there's kind of this guy i am seeing
how could i i am helping you clean up mark's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george
i think i turned into a werewolf and killed him
why the fuck would you do that
i could smell another woman on him
if you ask me the fucker got what he deserved i am glad he is dead
at least i finally saw the reason you could not get over mark
fuck it is the cops peter saw me now i have to let him in
what the fuck are we going to do
peter knows something
i think i just got my period
does that mean this whole thing is over
probably for three weeks or so anyway i am not sure  i do not get how it works
let's do some research i will check the libraries you surf the web
you are such a good friend
symptoms include loss of emotional control compulsive behavior cravings crying spells
guess she never found true love
the weird thing is he shot her with a silver bullet
so she was a werewolf do you think we can believe all this
what choice do we have
so what do i do
fall in love
i am cleaning my stove
you will get through this you were fine for over three weeks
i am just afraid i will hurt peter i think i love him
remember what madame sconce said if you love him he will be fine
but how do i know if i really love peter and if he really loves me
i guess you will find out
no i cannot take that chance i would rather kill myself
no i will not let you do that
i think george knows
about mark carlton
about benito
did i kill a guy named benito
frida you okay
never been better peter spent the night i must really love him he is still alive
oh thank god maybe this whole thing is really over
god i hope so hey can i call you later peter's still here he is in the shower
i know
so you are grant's secretary
i do development for tv movies
you are kidding really
man i am starving too i think i will go for the surf and turf
i am not really hungry after all
well whattdaya think
i would really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner
i am really tired
come on did not all that steak make you thirsty
no really i am i do not feel well i have got terrible pms
they say sex is great for cramps
i really gotta pee
you should have gone at the restaurant
i did not have to pee then
my apartment's just such a mess
that is okay i just have to use the bathroom and then i will leave
oh come on knock it off
knock what off
you do not have to pee
i would not mind doing something else but i do really have to pee
uh huh so pee

what you got a date or something
you look different i mean you look good
you never say that
look what you did
oh my god i am sorry
shit and you are eating my burger you do not eat meat

worried about what all your girlfriends might think
frida you know you are it for me
hey wait i paid three bucks for that burger you owe me
you have not even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me
where would you get the bike
frida i hear you talking i know you are in there let me in
it is a matter of life and death
this really is not a good time
so pay them back and apologize
these guys are not the kind that will take an apology they are the kind that will break my thumbs
you think that story's gonna make me loan you money
it is the truth if you would just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened
somehow this winds up being my fault you always blame me
come on i am your biggest supporter
the nielsongs
on your desk
script coverage
on your desk
coffee and
how about a man in jeopardy story
did you change your hair
i cannot read any more crap these women are all victims
yes that is what we are looking for
i think we should do something with strong female characters
whengs the last time you saw him
i wish i could help but last i saw gregory was outside my front door
you busted me
i gotta get going peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag
you wanna get some coffee
no really i do not drink coffee anymore i used to love it but my tastes have changed recently
okay well maybe some other time they continue walking together
so what book did you buy
oh it is nothing
no really i love knowing what people read
it is stupid
my mom used to get pms too
used to did it stop finally
no she died when i was twelve
i am sorry
i have had time to get over it she was killed by wolves they think
i am so sorry peter gee that sure puts my problems in perspective
a lot of people do not wear underwear
i really gotta get going
thanks for the walk maybe we could get a bite sometime
what are those
silver bullets a collectors item these are very valuable they were melted down from a crucifix

but you said the bodies were ripped to pieces
no why
frida i was looking for you you changing jobs
yeah sort of where is lloyd
i need to talk to you about us frida i can i carry your box
no i got it it is okay
i just do not know if i should be dating anyone right now
except mark of course
that is that supposed to mean
did i tell you i have the worst sense of humor and i make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times
this is a lot worse than betty
you cannot mean that i am sure your bark is worse than your bite
is that how you feel
like i had to say it no i wanted to say it
you did not say it
that is with the squirt guns
they are for my cat i use them to train him not to rip up paper
you know i have never seen your cat
your breasts feel larger
i did shave do i seem hairy peter laughs
frida you okay look i think i know what happened to mark i want to help i am coming over
no do not come over peter i i do not want to see you anymore ever
yes sort of i mean no not really
you at least owe me the truth
you want the truth remember i tried to tell you something the other day
yes your pms frida i can deal with that
go away i might hurt you
i am not afraid frida i love you
peter i love you too but
how do you know
i do not think you would no matter what form you take
i cannot take that chance i could not live with myself if i did anything to you
be careful
cannot you bite me and then i will be like you
no it does not work that way men cannot get pms unfortunately
i knew you would not kill me
maybe we should have children i do not think i would kill the father of my child
we can work this out other couples have worse problems
what about those guys i might have
that i am a doormat of course the shrink makes more notes
i think i am a werewolf
i ate a guy last night
and how did you feel when you ate this guy
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt you had sex last night and you feel guilty
cause i am a fucking werewolf
it is about gregory jameson he is dead
yes i we had dinner
did he come home with you did you go to his apartment
no it was our first date
a kiss did you have sex with him
we can get a warrant if you like
you heard about carlton fraser
seems you were the last to see carlton alive and the last to see gregory alive
no we left the restaurant and and i felt sick so so i took a cab home alone
you got a dog
no i have a cat
no he is not he is a courier he picks up packages from the airport
she is just so pathetic
she is just insecure once you get to know her she is fabulous
i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along
carlton insisted on leaving with her maybe he got lucky
it is for you frida
i am supposed to put up with a fucking cat i am allergic to cause your friend's got pms
oh great what the fuck am i supposed to do
take some allergy medicine
jesus christ she got her period relax guys it happens
how the hell is that your business
you want her sheets
i was thinking about becoming a cop myself do you take a test or something or just sign up
why would you want to be a cop
see he was cheating from the get go
you kidding they try to get me drunk
he was found a few blocks away
frida's sheets checked out fine it was just her own blood from her you know
i told you she was innocent
hey there was a lot of blood
she was never a suspect lloyd some animal must have done this
maybe what about all those hairs they found on his body
waiting for dna tests he was hairier than madonna in penthouse
he was found nearly ripped to shreds in central park
i still do not get when you gave her back the pillowcase
we only live a few blocks apart
this is more than fishy this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead
sounds like you got a conflict of interest
nah east village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park
deal and if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away shoot him
yeah okay i still say frida's involved she is the last one to see two dudes alive
he means the last that we know of
seems he is stolen money from them he is desperate and our only lead
it is a bit farfetched that mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy this makes no sense
it is like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes

my girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days

mr keating sir oh captain my captain  what was the dead poets society
ah so you boy's have been snooping
i was just looking in an old annual and
gosh they do not give you much room around here do they
are you kidding  he would kill me
eighteen  that is two years  what about the play  the performance is tomorrow night
give your father the benefit of the doubt  talk to him  let him see who you are
is not there an easier way
too bad
you really think i should forget her
damn  damn  if i could just get chris to read this poem
why do not you read it to her it worked for nuwanda
she will not even see me pitts
all right  what would she say
all right  jesus what are you gonna do
they are friends of my dad  probably in their nineties or something
are you crazy that is wrong with that
where are you going
i certainly would not lose any sleep over it  it is just a bunch of people trying to impress nolan
any group pictures in the annual
his grades are hurting charlie
i gotta get to the tryouts  wish me luck
but father i am assistant editor
i am sorry neil
but father it is not fair
i will not be disputed in public do you understand me
yes sir  i am sorry
you know what this means to your mother do not you
you know me always taking on too much
neil you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately
i say we go tonight  everybody in
where is this cave he is talking about
beyond the stream  i think i know
what is this a midnight study group
look at this
what is it
i hear we are going to be roommates neil perry
why would you leave balincrest
my brother went here
well you have won the booby prize  do not expect to like it here
so what do you think of my father

i i just do not want to come
but why  do not you understand what keating is saying  do not you want to do something about it
yes  but
put what  goddamn it tell me
i have found it
found what
a midsummer night's dream what is it
a play dummy
i know that  that is it got to do with you
neil how are you gonna be in a play if your father will not let you
first i gotta get the part then i will worry about that
will not he kill you if you do not let him know you are auditioning
as far as i am concerned he will not have to know about any of it
come on that is impossible
horseshit  nothing's impossible
why do not you ask him first  maybe he will say yes
that is a laugh  if i do not ask at least i will not be disobeying him
by the way there's a meeting this afternoon  you coming
none of what mr keating has to say means shit to you does it
what is that supposed to mean
being in the club means being stirred up by things  you look about as stirred up as a cesspool
you want me out  is that what you are saying
er  no
neil how are you gonna do this
sssh  that is what i am taking care of they need a letter of permission

the silver screengs loss is your gain
how about white
i want to know why you see him is it a patchett payoff
i see bud because i want to  i see bud because he cannot hide the warmth he has inside him
i came out here with a dream that is gone but i settled for reality
some reality
no  this is the means to the reality  but i am not going to tell you what it is
why not
you are tougher than bud thinks you are
you are the first person to ever call me tough
like recognizes like  i am pretty tough myself

i was uinu the store the accident was outside it was a bus
someone said you spoke to mr zavitz before he died i thought you might know something

mr zavitz was in trouble
what kind of trouble
you tell me
i cannot
are you invoking attorneyclient privilege
i am not his attorney
than why cannot you tell me
because i do not know

was he with anyone
not that i could see
why would you go to harrisongs
to buy lingerie
for your wife
uyesu for my wife what the hell kinds of questions are these
i do not know that is going on with zavitz but that was way uwayu outa line  you understand
not a very good one but
so you tap everyone's phone you use computers to probe financial records new search and seizure laws
just for the criminals
you should take this seriously
you are a lawyer do not you care that is going on around you
i saw a man die
what would you buy at harrisongs
how would you get the information on depinto
what do you mean
who did you work with to get the
a guy named brill same guy as always

that was not the answer i was hoping for
soon or at least sooner than never
ten thousand cash i do not know if it is brill's prices going up or your commission
i take a straight 15 percent brill's fee varies with risk perhaps you would be more comfortable using someone else
other than brill
other than me

someone with whom you do not have quite so personal a
i ulikeu our history and i like you i would probably like ubrillu if i ever got to
he does not work that way

through a window
the windows do not open
you ordering chop suey again
and the draft blew over the flowers
they have never caught him before what makes you think they will catch him now
you got a better idea
we have got to catch him in the act
why did not i think of that
it is not the thinking of it it is the doing it
i have been following this guy for years i am your best shot
how would you approach him hello mr macdougal i am gin would you steal a painting with me
that is doable
and a target guaranteed to catch his interest
you do not call you do not write
this was my first excuse to get away i cannot exactly use my cell phone
yeah yeah yeah that is the status
we are getting close
how close
i do not know but close
this is dangerous i am sending backup
you want to blow the whole thing go right ahead
do not overestimate yourself
look trust me i know what i am doing
where are you at least
gin where the hell are you
i am in the middle
in the middle you have got the mask why do not we have him
he is on to something bigger

i have a question

mr macdougal
i am sorry about the scroll but sometimes you have to lose to win

believe me if you were not so tiresome i would have one for you
you have a car
uh yes
seems i am
i will call an ambulance
you disappeared
you seemed to be handling everything quite nicely
are youokay
it was only a scratch far more damaging to my trousers than to me
i do not care about the damned car my luggage's been stolen
yes but they do not have a clue  why would anyone steal my luggage
maybe the thief thought you had something valuable you are in the business that is what roki says
like i would have art in my suitcase
of course you would not the rembrandt would not fit
i have got something
you are not taking me seriously
i did not expect you to be so
so what
do you mind
youyou cannot
you are shaking are you nervous
i have got something for you
and i thought we were getting on so well
we were we are but this is perfect for you
are you under the impression that now i am in some way obligated to you
well nobut
for god's sake
the empress death mask
i suspected it might be worthy of your interest
but roki said
maybe i should drive this time
very nice
you want me to pick up a painting
quite a good one a monet not major but it is giverney
i am not here to run errands i am here for the mask
it is a test
fine what do i do
how much am i paying
it is a fake
i am telling you it is a forgery the paint's still wet for god's sake
a film case
he says they turned the card down
damn i knew i forgot something
what the hell do i do now
what the hell was that
not bad i did not expect you to make it out
it is one way
we are going to die are not we
what about your bags
those are my clothes
you stole my luggage you
i am a thief sue me
that is entrapment
i do not believe this
that is your problem i am doing the job
that is my problem you want a list
lose something
i am impressed cannot spot a thing
nothing you do not even lock the door
why are we in separateyou know separate rooms
you are late
and good morning
good morning
nice spot
i know it well
as i recall you have robbed it before
years ago if memory serves when does the exhibit end
only a week
they are having a farewell party the last night before the mask goes back to taiwan
so the duke dug a tunneljust in case they made the lake a hundred years later flooded the tunnel
we are you implying that i am taking you inside
i go in alone
pack up i will see you get back to london
look i can help you need a sensor expert you have got one
you do not have any idea how lucky you are
a lifelong problem i am afraid
nice try everyone thinks i did
that is because i wanted them to
i wondered who would been giving me a bad name
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window it was the only way to bypass the smart glass
true enough
the rembrandtthat was quite good
someone was expecting that
i will need that
no one uneedsu anything except food and shelter the rest we just want
on what another job
we get the mask i will tell you
a partner with secrets is not much of a partner
without the mask it does not matter
so the mask is part of the down payment too must be a really big job
so you are testing umeu now
why do not we take oxygen
let's do it again
did i hear a car
all this this is a womangs version of what you would like
i did not mean to get personal
so how long to pop the floor
twenty four secondsas long as it takes the clock to strike twelve
and you have checked the ram to be sure it is synchronized with the clock
a dozen times
that is it we are ready
i trust it is your size
you bought this for me
thank you
no no i want to i will just go into the village
will not take any time
certainly the most beautiful crook i have ever seen
are not we early
to us to the mask
you were afraid of heights
terrified still am
how in the devil did you do the rembrandt then
i had a lifeline if i have got a lifeline i am okay
are not we all
he was not
so you had to be your own lifeline
camera in the
bookshelf sensors
popup on floorboards and
we are working
it is a party
one two three
do not turn i am counting the steps to the entrance
these rooms are solid stone they have not changed
you cannot be too careful
can you see the other pirs
they moved it
we did it
you are playing both sides of the street you are going to keep the mask and turn me in
okay you are a thief
yes yes
stop you are makingmistake
it is your mistake
the big job
your share
we are living history here
i like banks  that is where the money is
if you want a partner i think you should recalculate the split
no really it is your plan you should get at least 30 per cent
my eighty your twenty smart guy
come on what can you do with six billion you cannot do with four
hmmm44 long
idle hands the devil's workshop
the mask where is it
do you know what you have done do you know
oh my god i thought
what about the rules
wellwhat are we doing
the eight billion from them to us
peoples china bank
but those instructions they are recorded in the computer
nope the cd instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded xj6
a parting gift from the empire
the oscilloscope's already programmed
got it
then the vault how to get in the vault that is stumping me
that is where the mask comes in
so how long till we do this
you are out of your mind we cannot do a job like this with no rehearsal
there's no way to practice this and no time besides i have planned it all there are not any surprises
there's always a surprise
i have covered everything and you are the best so
for god's sake the only way i can get from one elevator to the other is to jump
how do i look
access codes to the vault are changed daily passwords for our computer on the hour
done  and i assume you have the magic cd rom
no way to take another day or two
you should not have
cannot break tradition it is bad luck
you have something in mind
that was a lifetime ago
it was wrong to deceive you
but would youwould you
of course not it was just a negotiating ploy
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention
so what are you going to do with your share
oh i do not care about the money
four billion dollars
seen one billion seen them all
that is because you grew up rich
not for me
i am going to disappear i die in a car crash in taiwan very easy to do
they drive so recklessly there
the sign of our partnership
and when eventually everyone discovers what transaction xj6 was really about
china will think it happened before midnight britain will swear it happened after midnight
jesus god it is going through
relax do not jam it
move it what are you waiting f
the disc is still in there
the door's the only way out
come on
hang on
i cannot get rid of you
put this on
it is only ninety seconds up the line you are on a connection to a trans siberian express
you are a cop
they have been on to you all along knew you had a big job going
you gave them the eight billion
a true master classic yet extremely sexual do not you think
we need to make the trade tomorrow
gin really
i am not real big on collecting banged up ferraris at airports
they work off the o2 tank just like the slice pack
which is
in the van
tina was a wonderful woman
i would give you a hand but it would not look good
yeah the lord of the manor does not haul his own groceries
the porta powercomm kitsgot the irthermo camera
had to get a liquid plasma screen
inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days
this is big enough
let me ask you this mask when they made itwas the old bitch dead or alive
that is it i sure as hell ai not no personal shopper
i would say she is a size 6 who wears a size 4
oh it is
i said a masked ball not a costume party
how the hell i am supposed to know the damn difference
it is too soon
the early bird gets the damn worm
so patience thibeau patience trust me
remind me why
you two make quite a couple
we are supposed to
you better not be taking on a new partner
suspicious after all these years
oh look at me darling i thought this gentleman was a waiter
you damn well thought wrong
tonight your league night
does not look like much how come those commos want it so bad
it is not just art it is history something you americans do not care aboutbecause you have not got any
this is just show and tell
i am waiting for the tell part
she is calling the shots now
you are impressed with her are not you
she is good give her that almost as good as she thinks she is
you know where my loyalties lie
you will just have to have faith
faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin i got to have trust
thirtyfive next generation microchips copper not silicon value one million each
you are giving them to me
call it an expression of trust
take this mask it may look like the empress but it is not
you got a real problem with priorities you know that
i really do not think that is a topic on which you have much to offer
takes a lot out of you one like this
yes it does
see you
probably not
oh hell  i am dyslexic
where have you been
what the fuck did you do with my stuff
um erin  listen  even though you are not necessarily my favorite person in the world    sometimes you are not halfbad

i want a raise  and benefits  including dental

how many families we talking about here
four more  eleven people  so far
this is a whole different ball game erin a much bigger deal
you are doing the right thing mr masry

pg&e corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in hinkley
oh they knew  they had to know
i like this case

i have not seen him  he probably came in through the south entrance
commander skywalker has not come through the south entrance sir maybe he slipped by without checking in
not likely  where are the speeders
we have not got them adapted to this cold yet 
we will have to go out on tauntauns
the temperature is dropping too fast
the night storms will start before you can reach the first marker
what is thy bidding my master
there is a grave disturbance in the force
i have felt it
our situation is most precarious we have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction
our destruction  who
the son of skywalker  you must destroy him  or he will be our undoing
he is not a jedi he is just a boy obiwan could not have taught him so much that 
you are weak  i have seen it the force is strong with him he must be destroyed
but if he could be turned he would be a powerful ally
yes  yes  that would be a great asset
good and commander skywalker
he is checking out a meteorite that hit near him he will be in soon
that is right
whatever it is it is not friendly i am going to have a look  come on chewie
wait  i will send a patrol with you
captain solo sir might i have a word with you
i shut it off  that is her royal holiness want
i do not know artoo  sir might i inquire that is going on
transport xj get out of here go
sir i was wondering 
sit down and shut up
i think we are in trouble
if i may say so sir i noticed earlier that the entire main para light system seems to be damaged
what are you so grouchy about
you too golden rod
it sounds like it is trying to get in
we are doomed  goodbye mistress leia  goodbye captain 
i can see the edge of the asteroid field sir
yes your highness
you said you were going to stay what happened
that bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind
not you
me  i do not know what you mean
you probably do not  how could you  you are so terrified of your own emotions 
and what are they pray tell
and you think you are the one to apply some heat
those creatures he keeps talking about  we would better double the security  han i do not know how 
now all we have got to worry about is what attacked him
 i am afraid there's not much left
what was it
droid of some kind  i did not hit it that hard  it must have had a selfdestruct 
an imperial probe droid
i do not know what he is talking about
you must have gone completely out of your feeble mind
hey  someone's still in here
would it help if i got out and pushed
this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade
this baby's got a few surprises left in her
i know i know i see them  leia see what
two more star destroyers heading right at us
that was no laser blast  some thing hit us 
asteroids  chewie bank left let's find out where they are coming from 
probably an asteroid field 
let's hope so  it is just the chance we need
to get killed  you are not seriously going into an asteroid field
well you said you wanted to be there when i was wrong
i take it back
but we are going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer
i am against that
we have got to get out of this shower
now you are making sense
there there  chewie get a reading on that  looks pretty good
what is it
why princess this is so sudden
very funny  you can let go now  i am getting angry
you do not look angry
sorry captain being held by you is not enough to get me excited
well i hope you do not expect more
i do not expect anything except to be left alone
that was no earthquake
they are moving away
they are just trying to see if they can stir something up  we are safe
easy your worship  only trying to help
sure  i guess i make it difficult sometimes
yes you do
sometimes maybe  occasionally when you are not acting like a scoundrel
what are you afraid of
do not count on it  i happen to like nice men
sure they are safer  you always know what they are going to do trouble is it gets a little dull
there's nothing dull about a man i can depend on to be civilized
you mean a man you can control
i do not
are you crazy
strap yourself in sweetheart we are taking off
i see it chewie hang on
no lightspeed
sharp bank chewie  let's turn this bucket around  you heard me turn around  full power on the front shield
i am still not sure what you have accomplished
not bad hot shot not bad  then what
then we have to find a safe port around here  got any ideas
that depends  where are we
funny i have the feeling i have been in this area before  let me check my logs
you keep logs  my how organized
well sometimes  ahhah i knew it  lando calrissian
can you trust him
you do have your moments  not many but you do have them
i do not like this
what are you staring at
who's staring
you look silly
you look great
i hope luke made it to the fleet all right
he found him in a junk pile 
something's wrong here  your friend lando is very charming but i do not trust him
well i do trust him  lando's an old friend  must have been an accident
no thanks
i was worried about you
i am worried about all of us  i cannot figure out what they are up to
 i love you  i could not tell you before but it is true
loud and clear kid  that is up
hi kid you look strong enough to wrestle a gundark
thanks to you
probe  what probe
about what
i hope you make your peace with jabba
why you slimy doublecrossing nogood swindler  am i glad to see you
no hard feelings
are you kidding
i always said you were a gentleman
sorry friend i had no choice they arrived right before you did
get out of here lando
shut up a minute and listen  i am doing what i can to make this easier for you
you do not know much about much if you think vader will not want us dead before this is over
he does not want you at all  he is after someone named skywalker
all this just to get the kid that is so important about him
what about leia and the wookiee
you will find them well enough but they must never again leave this city
that was never mentioned  neither was this bounty hunter taking han i hope you have not forgotten our bargain
i will take that is mine now
take them but i am keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them
that was not the bargain  you said the empire would not interfere in
hello  what have we here  welcome i am baron lando calrissian administrator of this facility  and who might you be
sorry am i interrupting anything
not really
 we are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the empire
what about han
lord vader has set a trap for him and 
look i stand to lose everything by this
chewie's right  we must try to save han
very noble  not smart but noble
you have probably never done an honorable thing in your life
sure i did  once  it turned out lousy
you would better know what you are doing or this is going to get very messy
we have got to find luke
what would you say
no argument just do it  that is a command
someone's falling
the deflector shields are gone
i am sure my men fixed it  we have got nothing to worry about
nothing more can be done tonight the shield doors must be closed i cannot wait any longer  i am sorry
the speeders should be ready in the morning  they will make the search easier
is there any chance of them surviving out there
have they analyzed the one that was killed
we have picked up something outside the base in zone one moving east
two transports at a time is awfully risky
you rest now
so much has happened during the period of your indisposition sir
a tremor
rather touchy are not they
artoo you did it  i never doubted you for a second 
leia  what would you think if i went away for a while
where are you going
i have this  feeling  i am not sure really 
that is just great  why does not everyone just take off
what are you talking about
first han now you  when am i going to learn not to count on anyone but myself 
calm down will ya  tell me about han
he wants to pay off that criminal he is in hock to
jabba the hutt
i could get more loyalty if i went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures
lando is he alright  lando are you there  how is luke
this hyperdrive had better work
why not me
i have followed my feelings
i will not fail you  i am not afraid
it would be in seven pieces were you a jedi
i thought i was in good shape
master moving rocks is one thing but this is a little different
no  no different  the differences are in your mind  throw them out no longer of use are they to you
okay  i will give it a try
i cannot it is too big
i do not believe it
concentration  heh  concentration
i thought those seekers were set for stun
that they are
no no  this will not do  anger is what you feel
lord vader  is the dark side stronger
no no  easier quicker more seductive
but tell me why 
four this time  the force you feel
that is in there
ben  ben
free your mind and return he will
my mind fills with so many images
control control you must learn of what you see  not easy not fast
i see a city in the clouds
bespin  i see it too  friends you have there heh  concentrate and see them you will
i see them  they are in pain  they are suffering
will they die
they are my friends
yes yes  to obiwan you listen young one  the tree  remember your failure at the tree  heh
and sacrifice han and leia
the fear does not reach you  you have learned more than i anticipated
you will find i am full of surprises
there is much obiwan did not tell you  come the emperor will complete your training
i will die first
all too easy  perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought
the hoth system
seventeen ships destroyed we do not know how many got away

why it is perfectly plain your the teacher at the college you do not want the building torn down
c'mon i can read for christ sake
well that is wrong
well why are they tearing the building down
what honey
and what about the exorcist any ideas
that is he doing there teaching
no he is working on another book
do not you think he is too old though how is his health
it must be alright he is still running around digging up tombs besides he is had experience
i did not know that
it might be best to have a man with experience maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions
i see your excellency
let's see whose around in the meantime i will call you as soon as i know
it is
and i do not care what you call it i am not putting her away
i am sorry
oh great anything else
and you got an invitation
that is this
dinner at the white house
your kidding me what is it a big party or something
just five or six people
maybe the circuit is busy
oh circuit my ass he does not give a shit
what did not he tell you
what did the doctor say
oh burke poor burke
this was under regangs pillow did you put it there
where do you want this
i am gonna miss you
me too
does your daughter remember if perhaps mr dennings was in her room in her room that night
no she was heavily sedated
it is serious
yes i am affraid it is
may i ask
we still do not know
no not at all
you were expecting a deliver y that day
not that i know of
groceries maybe a package
i really would not know you see karl takes care of that
oh i see
want to ask him
when she is well enough i will ask
i hate to ask you this but for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph
oh she would love it
thank you
good morning madame
but it is clean
no no rats
yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps
yes i go now
there is nothing
oh karl jesus christ karl do not do that
very sorry but you see no rats
karl did you put this in regangs bedroom
she is going to be well
karl if you put this in regangs room i want you to tell me now did you
a man to see you
excuse me madame will there be anything else
good morning mrs macneil
how are you today
fine thank you
is it coming out willie
why the math
now this is for ritalin ten miligrams a day
what is it a tranquilizer
a stimulant
well you mentioned her father the divorce
ya know those things to get attention like saying that her bed shakes and stuff
well you see that is quite similar to things like her lying uncharacter
wait a minute what are you talking about
well she let loose quite a string while i was examining her mrs macneil
you are kidding like what
well i would say her vocabulary's rather extensive
hey come on i am grownup what would she say i mean specifically doctor
well specifically mrs macneil she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt
she used those words
she used those words look i doubt that she even understood what she was saying
so what causes this
lesion lesion in the temperal lobe it is a kind of seizure disorder
she is heavily sedated she will probably sleep through tomorrow
do you keep any drugs in your house
no of course not nothing like that
are you sure
well of course i am sure i would tell you christ i do not even smoke grass
chris macneil
please go away
oh i am very sorry father hi
that is okay i should have told you i would not be in uniform
so how would a shrink ever get to be a priest
harvard bellevue john hopkins
you are a friend of father dyer right
yes am
pretty close
pretty close
did he tell you about my party
sure did
about my daughter
no i did not know you had one
did not tell you of what she did
he did not mention her
priests keep pretty tight mouthed then
that depends
on what
if he came to me for spritual help i would say no
you would not
no i would not but i would try to persuade him to turn himself in
and how do you go about getting an exorcism
i beg your pardon
i did not get you
well it just does not happen anymore mrs macneil
that is all the more reason to forget about exorcism
why i do not understand
to begin with it could make things worse
you could do it yourself
no i could not i have to have church approval and frankly that is rarely given
could you see her
no you do not understand your daughter
thanks look i am only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good
nothing you could do would make it any worse
i cannot do it i need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession
like what
like her speaking in a language that she is never known or studied
what else
i do not know i will have to look it up
did you know my mother died recently
yes i did i am sorry
no is regan aware of it
not at all why d'you ask
no it is alright i will take it straight
are you sure
where is regangs father

what kind of stuff

maybe some rituals used in black mass maybe
and dennings you read how he died

what do you mean
i was in a coma pollux i still feel like shit
you porked his wife the day he was arrested  how could you forget that
i do not know  everything's jumbled  so you are going to have to help me fill in a few blanks
uh  to kill the doctors
after that  you promised you would always take care of me
and i bet i have kept that promise 
that is not the worst part
thanks pollux
for what
for being one helluva guy

whoever you are do not call again
i know you  you are the one who called  you are castor troy  you killed my son 
i took it from my fake husband
why point it at me  i am the real thing

you cannot go  you cannot be anywhere near that place
jon what is it
the bomb  he is reactivated it  and everyone there is going to die

would it
how is loomis
apparently fine  he is coming into work  that is the good news 
go on
which ear was it
jon this is goddam insane you cannot go through with it  what about eve

how is the date night idea going over with eve
like gangbusters doc  okay i missed the last one
you missed the last three including her birthday  your wife's gripe sheet
one of my informants spotted him  right here in the city
i just asked you about making love to your wife and you started talking about your job
i am not hiding in my work if that is what you are saying
jon i am getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun
that is it to you  i declare it  here i am back in the states for less than a month 
you can tell me all about it  from your prison cell
not anymore
what are you going to do castor
stay away from my family
what  what are you doing
i do not know  how long before it kills us
give up castor  people are going to find out
they are too tight
you will what
you better be nice castor you could get mighty lonely now that pollux is gone
pollux is  what
archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence he is free
walton you have to let me see the warden 
sfpd  castor is not stupid enough to come back to the city
we have got him sighted okay pollux pull out
what makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother
just saving the taxpayers the cost of a trial  so take a hike
that is the matter with your voice commander
clarissa left those here
i will not tell mom if you do not
when did you start smoking
get a higher arc on the ball jamie  and for chrissake square your shoulders to the basket
what are you  stupid
you mean like  condoms

castor's escaped
what happened
commander what are you doing here
where should i be  where is everyone else
it was confirmed by your personal security code nobody knows that code but you
do not get mad but i just went for a little stroll through the company switches
are you trying to give us away for somebody with such a big brain you think awfully small
i am just having some fun
eight pocket stingers  seven piper uzis  six cobra carbines   five  net  launchers 
we gut the organization  and rebuild it with more reliable friends
most of the current chiefs  they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads
you will need to recultivate that virus
what about me
a lot of people think you are a snitch  it is dangerous 
you are the only person in this place who can see right through me
you have made us look pretty good in the past week  and the way you handled the press 
just following your example
dc's very high on giving you the promotion  there's just one problem
that is that
me  i have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job
you would have to start immediately
done  in fact i was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs
i just heard about castor's fratricide  rather poetic do not you think
what is it admiral i am under the gun here
i just thought that  under the circumstances  you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs
no  most of them are in transit by now  i am heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security
what happened to your big assignment

as much as ever  nothing
it did not work out as planned where are you off to

jesus jack

mrs peterson
peter  i do not see you rushing home to trim the tree
that is because i am a heartless bastard who only cares about money
i just got a call from terry haight  bob thomas is nervous
that will happen when you are about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin
someone's gonna have to nurse him through this
why are you staring at my breasts peter
i need you tiger
hey peter lemme ask you a question  an old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on christmas eve
you suddenly having trouble getting dates
peter lassiter
do i know you
were really more of a boutique operation as you can see
he certainly has your number alan
for one thing you like expensive things
for the money theyre hands down the best radial we carry
can i help you
is kate here does kate live here
hey are you okay
noim not
hey my wifes in the kitchen you got a cigarette
did you really mean what you said about tuscany
of course i did
last night was great
you are an amazing lover  you should be giving motivational seminars
i want to see you again
it is christmas eve jack
i have to go to my parents' house out in jersey  would you like to come
jersey  you know what the traffic's gonna be like
do not you have anywhere to go
maybe i can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning  okay
thats totally see through
merry christmas
do you want me to look for the box or call the airline
hey kind of under a little pressure here
where do we stand
okay to proceed
they have crossed over into the jugular vein
that cannot be  there's no direct connection between the two 
doctorwithout killing him  how long could we stop his heart
the less time the better
i know that but that is the maximum
at topspeedand adjusting distance for degree of miniaturization   the sub should get through the heart in fiftyseven seconds
that would give us only three seconds to revive him
what are the problems in stopping the heart
cardiac red alert we are stopping the heart
they are in the pulmonary artery
another delay with only fortytwo minutes left
it will be close  but there's still a margin of safety
i told you to cut down on the sugar
time's up we will have to take them out immediately
what is it
that blip we are picking up might only be the radioactive particle the proteus may already be destroyed
now how soon can we try sodium pentathol
i would hold that off awhile
hello grant good to see you again
benes what the devil happened
the other side got to him
how bad off is he
brain injury
i cannot even put a bandaid on my finger
duval dr peter duval top brain man in the country ever hear of him
sorry but i am rusty on surgeons who's the girl
cora peterson his technical assistant you will join duval and the others 
wish i knew why
but why take the chance when there must be other doctors
we have no choice duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country and he is right here at hand
right sir
his technician okay in addition to the looks department
combined miniature deterrent forces
they are bound to try again no wonder they want me to stand by during the operation
and take a little trip with them
you mean i am going along
as part of the crew
wait a minute they cannot shrink me
grant our miniaturizer can shrink anything
but i do not want to be miniaturized  
this is dr duval our head surgeon
oh yes great the only problem is he cannot remember what he came to tell us
cannot remember what do you mean
yes we would like to get moving
yes alan
meet grant this is dr michaels chief of the medical section
[line of dialogue cut off]
i do not agree just because he is often difficult 
difficult he is impossible
i will be standing by i will know
listenthe heart
i cannot imagine how it possibly could have come loose i distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts 
but we just cannot leave him in there what will happen to him
that is beside the point now  i do not see the sense of going on
we must
you are going out there with those antibodies 
would not it be quicker if we all helped
yes cora
what is it  anything wrong
i just wanted to thank you for taking me along
never saw that not even under an electronmrcroscope
yes a fistula too small to show up on the xrays
air bubbles doctor 
cora is something wrong with the laser
he is making a fine recovery
bet you are pretty handy around the house can you cook
we are pushing oxygen today
i will take some laughing gas ma'am
you sound as if you are not looking forward to it
that is the trouble i am being shrunk
that will teach you where to keep your hand
a long time with one man
i nevernever imagined it could be anythinglike this
 at which point the heart will be stopped by electric shock
look at thatthey are changing color
looks like you did not batten it down too well
then how come it worked loose
should not you answer that
you must carry spare parts 
no it requires such absolute precision 
a surgeon might
oh yes i am sure dr duval could if we had the parts
open it open it before they get here
no need to get up 
thank you for saving my life
that is what they pay me for
such as
keeping an eye on dr duval
that is why you are really here i knew it from the start
depends on which end of the telescope you look through
we better get back to the sub every second counts now
doctor that is wrong
i cannot breathe i have got to get out
looks like the molecular structure of proteins
i do not agree i think we ought to stop and take a sample
but that is not possible
we cannot take a second more
nothing miraculous about it just an interchange of gases the end product of five hundred million years of evolution
what can we do
it is against my better judgment
better judgment to wait until the actual operation  when it may be too late
i have done all i could with the laser
as usual you want everything your way except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake
the soul the finite mind cannot comprehend infinity and the soul which comes from god is infinite
and certain chemicals involving proteins 
you left something out
that is that
removal point what are you talking about
you mean inner space is endless
i would hate to get lost on that freeway
is not there another surgical procedure you can try
we will never get there in time at this rate
is not there another route so we can bypass all this
yes  we can transfer over to the inner ear and go by way of the endolymphatic duct
yet all the suns that light the corridors of the universe shine dim before the blazing of a single thought  
how does it look doctor
doctor we have just about had it
the ship's good as finished we will have to get out on our own is there a quick way out
you said there was a quick way out
what about dr michaels
we need you for security purposes mr grant
miss peterson his technical assistant
a what
if we cannot go back is there an alternate route
that is just dandy we cannot go forward  and we cannot go back
tell them to take us out
if there's any chance 
sounds like heavy artillery
there it is
yes  with all that pressure and suction within 
all right now  push the snorkel through as soon as i get inside
grant  wait a minute  you are not going to dismantle the wireless
just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes
but that will knock out our communications we will be cutting ourselves off from the outside
well sir which is it the wireless or benes' life
cough if he can kick up a storm by just breathing 
his pleura's in fine condition it should be clear sailing through this area
you have no right to blame duval 
you still never know that is going on in anyone's mind
i cannot believe it whatever happened was an accident
two in a row
we are entering the lymphatic system those are nuclei of cells lining a duct
skipper you are picking up seaweed  or whatever it is
looks like somebody declared war
they are tracking us topside once they see where we are going i am sure they will take every precaution
i am in charge of this mission you were instructed to take orders from me not give them
sorry we had to get you up at this hour mr grant
i thought i was on my vacation that is it all about
i cannot tell you
where we going
may i
what would you do that for
i am married
out of your element are not you captain
sort of
atomic fuel
that is cutting it mighty close  for a perfect fit
all in all quite a canoe
designed for piscatorial research  the spawning habits of deep sea fish
'prepare for miniaturizationg
any reserve air
what happened
dr michaels he went berserk
come on  it is no use
who me oh no do not bother about me we are not hurt is not that right skipper
uh  what
we feel great do not we just great
oh  sure sure never better
what is it skipper
yes there is
thirtytwo minutes left  but chances are we will not have to wait that long for trynumber three
that is wrong skipper
how is it look
captain how will you be able to follow my charts   from up there
that is it
i will never find my way through that
well that takes care of the valve it was probably caused by that electric shock
was there any damage
we could never fight that current it is physically impossible
then do not drift down further
doctor  the channel's getting awful narrow
we are entering a capillary remain in the middle
the wall's transparent
there seems to be something wrong with the escape hatch
what do you mean
what do you mean you decided not to park here
you uh i am sorry sir but 
i decided not to  i am uh not taking the trip as it turns out
i am sorry sir we do have to charge you the four dollars

why do you do these stupid things
i have to
you do not have to
i just want you to like me
i do like you  but not when you act like a jerk
being a jerk is better than being nothing

it is my graduation gift from daddy it cost over a thousand bucks but it is the best
he bought you that
a major prick
what are you going to do
i think it is time for some recreational activity girl
sounds good i hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck  it might be kinds cool
no thanks
what do not be a lightweightthis is top dollar toot
it is not that it is just that  it i get caught i will lose my science scholarship and everything

never mind you do not want to know about it
did you hear that
all right all right  i am a major ass
and you will never do it again
which cabin is rennie in mr mcculloch
but i thought
where is the radio
christwhere is rennie
she isshe is dropping the anchors i thought the coast guard could find us easier if
that is that
she never should have set foot on this ship this is your fault
this is jasongs fault
dear christ
jasongs here in new york
they are out of town
where did you get that alcohol
that is it you are not setting foot off this ship until we return home
hello charles has everyone checked in
jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up i am a little concerned
let's go  we are running two minutes late
you have no right
and neither do you it is up to rennie to decide what she wants to do
she does not know what she wants she is never had a stable life
she is fine charles take it easy
i thought i told you to stay away from her
i demand to know what is going on
what are you doing
that lunatic has been spouting off about jason since we boarded  it is no coincidence
but that does not prove that he is the one
he is doing the best he can charles
i doubt very much that one even exists
what did you do with rennie
there must be a phone around here somewhere
everyone split up  we will cover more ground that way
i do not think that is such a safe idea
what a beautiful day
he never learned how either and he is still at the bottom of this lake
he is not
oh he is indeed and ready to pull down anybody who falls in and cannot swim
you are telling a lie
ii cannot
you are making a big mistake rennie it is not too late to put you back on land
i am staying
if miss van deusen knew how afraid you were of
she did not push me into coming
facing your fear does not always conquer it
you had me worried to death
cannot we at least talk about it
i refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship
i am not staying in my room uncle charles
get in the boat rennie
ii cannot
you pushed me
i am glad you decided to come after all
everything okay
since the school is closing anyway i am going to write that novel i have been threatening on everybody
stephen king supposedly used it when he was in high school
rennie  i was just on my way over to your room
so are you having fun yet
yeaha lot
i seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone  in other words level with me
i cannot swim
it is not that simple
maybe not but you are not telling me everything are you
when did this start
about four years agoat crystal lake i spent a few summers there with uncle charles inbetween boarding school
did you have an accident in the lake
the captain and chief engineer they have beenthey are dead
what is your location
ii do not know
i have got the numbers
hi sean
i heard you were not coming
i got you a present
but i did not get you one
it is okayyou are going to be okay
i do not knowwe have gone off course or something
i think so but we have to lower the anchors so we do not drift any further
where are they
i did not mean for you to go
rule one do not panic rule two assess the damage and act accordingly
we will be okay i want you to wait by the lifeboats just in case
i am not going near any lifeboat
but rennie
renniewhat would they do to you
you have to call the police
just like proper english gentlemen i am proud of them
here you see even the south african papers apologize  a monstrous attack
are you sure
sora was sent to tell me i  i must rake and cover the latrine
everyone takes his turn
it is the work of untouchables
in this place there are no untouchables  and no work is beneath any of us
i am your wife
please you are being foolish
take a fifth step that we may serve the people
take a sixth step that we may follow our vows in life
is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that
no that is what you get for distracting me
what do you expect when you talk like that
just an admirer
you would be gandhi   i thought you would be bigger
that was lucky
i thought you were a man of god
that is the sort of thing you will be seeking on this farm
no violence please
what are you doing
not quite they are only holding me until the magistrate's hearing then it will be prison
if i want to be one with them i have to live like them
i am sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine
they are calling you bapu i thought it meant father
and i knew something had to give and i was determined to be here when it did
how does a reporter in central america learn that gandhi was born in porbandar anyway
you mean gandhi
back in south africa  long time ago
what was he like
lots of hair and a little like a college freshman  trying to figure everything out
what would he say
excuse me baas but how long have you been in south africa
a  a week
i will take your luggage back baas
fortunately such news comes very slowly where i live
what can we do
if we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed i want no part of it
it was one incident
i do not believe it  even the british cannot be that stupid
and jinnah
he is waiting he is not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think
what do you want
without a paper  a journal of some kind  you cannot unite a community  you belong to a very important profession
hm and what should an important professional write about your response to general smuts's new legislation
i do not know i am still searching for a response
you will respect the law
well it is quite a place your ashram  is that right
you are an ambitious man
it is beautiful
and you have come all this way because you think something is going to happen
hm  is it
do you remember much of south africa
you have done me a great service
are you going to walk all the way
good  ba will have to teach you to spin too
i would rather march
do you find me stubborn
i am sure i am fit for at least five hundred miles
it is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man
after what they did at the massacre  it is only an eye for an eye
i will not sit by to see the mastery of the british replaced by the mastery of the hindus
it must have been the only nonviolent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day
we need your help
in england i was a poor student but i 
you mean you employ mr baker as your attorney but you cannot walk down the street with him
well then it must be fought we are children of god like everyone else
allah be praised and what battalions will you call upon
my wife publicly defied the law they have arrested her and four others
the fools  sorry
it is split the government
will you have a glass of sherry
perhaps some tea
hm of course it is not quite that simple
you are an extraordinary man
assuming we are in agreement
yes  yes it is just that in these clothes i would  i would prefer to go by taxi
all right fine
i am  i am afraid i have no money
ah  we should invite gandhi what the devil has happened to him anyway
have you read his magazine
he was right it is insane  anything would have been better
could we cut all news off i know 
you almost sound like you believe that
come with me now vincent  you have gone as far as you can go
there are a few million miles to go yet
it is over
is that the only way you can succeed anton to see me fail
well  you have all the answers  how is that possible
you did not beat me that day  i beat imyselfi
who are you trying to convince
how are you doing this vincent  how have you done ianyi of this
vincent where is the shore  we are too far out we have to go back
is there any reason you would want a lefthanded child
how much extra
so you have finally seen sense and come back to your old job vincent
not yet i am afraid
no  that is keeping you
i guess i am a slow learner
i guess so  well while you are up there maybe you could tidy the place up a bit
by the way i left some trash in your locker
a mangs dead detective
no ithisi is your man
with respect sirit may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests
even if this vincent luca iisi alive is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death
of course that does not jibe with what we found  this was an angry killing
who knows with these deficients  his profile indicates a proclivity for violence
i will run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections
i have already run it  there's no record of any living relative
we are in the wrong place  we are wasting time
we are already getting complaints about frivolous search
the skin flake was found in michael's restaurant the employees are all accounted for
a customer  does this michael's cater to misfits
do not underestimate these imposters
none of the id photos match the enhancement
that is the last
something's not right
he is not here  it is a blind alley
no we have missed something  we hoover again
we do not have the manpower
get it  from outside if you have to
from what budget
what are you waiting for
where do we start
it is not iexactlyi him
surely you know what you have
we believe we have a suspect
what a relief
would you care to lookin the telescope
thank you no
one look through there and you would know why i cannot possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further
twelve have a mission within the week
at least it is nothing contagious
good to see you are feeling better
now iyou arei here  who are your friends
that is where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded
i have been looking for him  do you know where he is
do not be deceived irene  these are just the clothes  he has to wear them something i could never do
that is wrong with him
okay how tall did you iusedi to be
six one
you okay jerome
i have to know where you come from
if anybody asks tell them the truth your family disowns you  you are a disappointment jerome
what about this
it needs work
you had to be a righthander
you really need that much
imorei than that  you will get used to it
it is not too late to back out
what about you  that is in this for you eugene
who died
the mission director
you wish
what an act of benevolencea service to the community  so that is it  now there's nothing between you and ignition
he was still warm when they confirmed
this calls for a celebration  does not it
the place is crawling with hoovers
let's get out of here
i gotta stop  i gotta stop
at least up there your piss will be worth something  you will all be showering in it right
and drinking it  it is like evian by the time it is filtered
1115 to the port  a maintenance crew
how long do you stay up there before you go
up there they would not be a problem
i am sorry  i am sorry
it is okay eugene

fuck you

this looks corny
these old movies are such a hoot they thought they were being scary but they are just funny
maybe it is supposed to be funny
you know what  i think you guys are all jealous
that is to be jealous of
i have gotten to know someone who's famous
that is that mean
it means it is too cold to go swimming  and i do not mean the water
i was not going to try anything
do you realize you are more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me
it is different  he is a man  and by the way you have no business calling him a homo
it never crossed your mind
he is an artist  anyway he is too old to think about sex
you picked up that girl right in front of me
hey no strings right  that is what you always said  just good pals who have the hots for each other
it still hurt  a lot
you liked it too
sure  i loved it
if you enjoy it you should do it
you know i just cannot do that anymore  i still have time to get things right  get married again 
i like my life  i am a free man
so you do not want to fuck  that is what you are telling me
is that all this conversation means to you  am i going to put out or not
do not worry you already paid me i am here because 
it is your job lady not mine  i am here so he can draw my picture
i am keeping away  what you are doing is no business of mine

the master is dressing  i am to offer you a drink  there is whiskey and there is iced tea
no  you are a guest now  you go in the living room
how long you worked for mr whale
long enough  fifteen years
you mean family  all in joplin missouri
your wife
oh i do not know  because no girl in her right mind will have me
a man who is not married has nothing  he is a man of trouble you need a woman
you ever been married hanna
of course  i am married still
yeah  that is your husband do
he is dead now twenty years
you are sure of that
this is what the priests tell me his sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven
sins of the flesh  everybody has those
what is the good english  all i know is bugger  he is a bugger men who bugger each other
a homo
you are telling me mr whale is a homo
you did not know
wellno not really 
i am not going to hurt anyone
i need to talk to you about mr whale
there is nothing you can say that will surprise me
thanks  why do you do it
what do i do
what have you done with him
i did not do it  this was not me
oh mr jimmy
you must leave  you were not here this morning
but i did not do this
the police will not know that they will want to investigate
but how are you going to explain this  how did you get him out of the pool
my name is whale  this is my house
nice place
and your name is 
boone  clayton boone
i could not help but notice your tattoo  that phrase  death before dishonor  what does it mean
just that i was in the marines
getting to be a warm day  a scorcher as you yanks call it
everything alright mr boone
or would you prefer a beer
these are your paintings
what  oh yes
excuse me but  are you famous
you know what they say  if you have to ask 
in my youth yes but never in hollywood  no i was merely a director here
yeah  what were some of your movies
frankenstein and bride of and son of and all the rest
i made only the first two  the others were done by hacks
still  you must be rich  making a couple of famous movies like those
what did she mean by going flooey
i returned recently from a stay in hospital
what was wrong
to an artistic eye you understand have you ever modeled
you mean like posed for pictures
sat for an artist  been sketched
that is to sketch
you have the most architectural skull  and your nose  very expressive
broke is more like it
but expressively broken  how did it happen
football in college
you went to university
just a year  i dropped out to join the marines
you mean  you really want to draw me
indeed  i would pay for the privilege of drawing your head
but why
even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him
and it is just my head you want nothing else
what are you suggesting  you will charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder
you do not want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit right
all right then  sure  i could use the extra dough
did you see this  they are showing one of your movies tomorrow night
you do not say  which picture
bride of frankenstein
that shirt mr boone
i am not wearing an undershirt
pish posh mr boone  i am not your aunt tilly
but it is just my face you want to draw
we could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders  would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness
take a picture it lasts longer
would you be more comfortable barefoot  feel free to remove your boots and socks
sounds like something you feed the dog
it is  only the poorest families ever ate it  we kept ours in a crockery jar
your family ate dripping
we were not rich  but we were not poor either
no you were middle class like all americans
you have to excuse me mr boone since my stroke i am often overcome with nostalgia
how are you mr boone  so glad you are free for lunch
all right i guess
do you mind
is this david's doing
saw your movie the other night watched it with some friends
did you now
i liked it  we all did
pity  people are so earnest nowadays
did you kill anyone
i do not like to talk about that
it is nothing to be ashamed of in the service of one's country that is something to be proud of
proud  any jerk with a gun can kill someone
quite true  handtohand combat is the true test  did you ever slay anyone handtohand
no  i could have though
yes i believe you could  how free is your schedule this afternoon
full up  i got the hedges to do here then another lawn out by la cienega
what is we say phooey to the hedges  could you spare an hour after lunch  to sit for me
cannot today
i will pay our going rate  plus what you would get if you did the hedges
sorry  i do not feel like sitting still today
just a trim  and mine while you are at it  fingers are a bit stiff today
you ever been married mr whale
so you had a wife
does that surprise you
no i  you are a homosexual
oh dear  if one must have a clinical name
i am not you know
i never thought you were
you do not think of me that way do you
what way might that be
so we understand each other
what you do is no business of mine live and let live i say
i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today
can i see what you did so far
it will only make you selfconscious  you will have to remove your shirt
sorry  not today
but we have to match the other sketch
oh dear  i uhaveu made you nervous
i do not mean to be a prick but that is how i feel
tell me more about yourself mr boone  you have a steady companion
not at the moment
why not
you know how it is  you have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it
very well put
the world is just one kissass game after another  a man has to make up his own life alone
ah  a philosopher
is that why you and your friend split up  because you wanted to be free
do you miss it
you have done a helluva lot more than most people
is not it enough you told me you are a fairy  do you have to rub my nose in it
i assure you mr boone i meant no 
the extras are in their places now we need the star  would not you like to get in the pool
you first
mr boone  you are not due to cut the lawn until wednesday
i am curious mr boone  what convinced you to come back
i do not know  i guess i like your stories
everybody has stories to tell
not me
what about your stint in korea i am sure it was full of dramatic episodes
and the fear you showed at our last session  how did you overcome that
there's no people like you in my crowd
no teammates in football  no comrades in korea
you must think the whole world is queer  well it is not  war sure is not
oh there may not be atheists in the foxholes but there are occasionally lovers
you are talking through your hat now
not at all  i was in the foxholes myself
you were a soldier
you will not set me on another walk down memory lane  not this lane not today
i did not 
why do i tell you this  i never told david  i never even remembered it until you got me going
you asked me to model  remember
my apologies  i had no business snapping at you
no harm done
it was foolishness to attempt this portrait  you cannot force what will not flow
i am game  sure
very good clayton  may i call you clayton  or do you prefer boone
good afternoon clayton
i suppose you would like the top down
if that is okay
what did i tell you  listen
i do not hear anything
what was that about
who's that
david  the friend i thought was in new york
no  the girl
is that really her
are you enjoying yourself
actually no  i feel a little out of place
neither of us really belongs here
must have been funny for you seeing your monsters again
oh fuck  and we left the top down you want to run for it
run for what
let's get out of this funk hole
you do not want to wait it out rain should let up soon
i better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia
it is not like her
just a night out  sounds like she cannot say no to her daughter
certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man
oh of course  clayton  you finished your shower already
ten minutes ago  did not you hear me calling
you are much wider than i am  you will not want to attempt to get into my pants
that only leaves the rest
do i have any other choice
is that 
after dinner if hanna is not back can we try a few more sketches
i thought you would given up on my picture
i would like to try again  if you are game
tell me something clayton  do you believe in mercy killing
i never made it to korea
but you said 
 that i was a marine  which is true  you filled in the rest
my old man was a marine  he enlisted the day he turned seventeen
the great war
by the time he was ready to ship out the fighting was over  he missed out
what happened
i am very sorry
them's the breaks right  no war stories for this pup
do you mind
storm's getting worse
a perfect night for mystery and horror  the air itself is filled with monsters
that is from your movie right the only monsters are here
i do not remember that one
i do not recall  memories of the war perhaps
but that was so long ago  it cannot still bother you
oh but it does  especially in light of the journey i am about to make
barnett  barnett on the wire
oh death where is thy stingaling grave where thy victory
so it is going to happen after all
no  it will not do
what will not do
you are much too human
what did you expect  bronze
for the artistic effect  the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask  it is quite striking
i do not know
please clayton  just for a minute  long enough for me to see the effect
it is from the first world war is not it
all right  let's take it off now
what was that
just take off the fucking mask
i am not that way  get it through your fucking head  i do not want to mess with you
wait until i tell my friends i had you naked in my arms  will not they be surprised
you okay
oh clayton
did i hurt you
nothing i did not deserve
need some help
i can undress myself thank you
when you diebe sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle 
you will feel better tomorrow
boone  you awake  eight o'clock
fuck off
i am up  thanks
i liked it  you learn stuff listening to oldtimers
you coming boone
hey boone
calm down clay  just calm down we will watch it
you are like a dog with a bone over this movie clay
sick stuff  necrophilia  i wonder if they knew how sick they were
go home clay  we are closing up
where is betty
then take the pills
i am sorry jimmy  but with this movie and two difficult stars 
the fault dear david is not in ourselves but in our stars
by the way i like the renoir
thank you
what are you doing here
just what i was about to ask you i thought you were in new york
should you be drinking in your condition
you should have seen georgie's face when he met clayton
you did not jimmy
i did  but princess margaret was a doll  we are all equals in her eyes  as commoners i presume
you only embarrass yourself
oh dear  i will never work in this town again
you know what i mean  your reputation
but i have no reputation  i am as free as the air
well the rest of us are not  cannot you remember that
i did not ask george to invite you
then who did
jimmy there are people here i need to speak to  you will be fine on your own
yes  perfectly
yes yes dr payne  but from the neck up  that is my story there
in a manner of speaking  i have never encountered the olfactory hallucinations but i am sure they are related
so what do i do
only a mad scientist could do this to a woman
oh no my dear  you look absolutely amazing  there's no way i can compete with you  the scene is yours
in the sequel james two lady scientists should make a monster and our monster would be gary cooper
i would have thought mr leslie howard would be more your line
more your line
uhoh  the way you look at me james  what have you done this time
bring a mirror  let the bride feast upon her visage
and you said there would be some of me left  nobody's going to know me in this getup
i saw una o'conner a few weeks ago she said you would been under the weather
oh nothing out of the ordinary growing old
we are all getting a bit long in the tooth
please  you should not stand on my account
perfectly all right  but if you would like to sit 
i am fine jimmy  i can only stay a few minutes
of course
is that boris  our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion
we will be in touch jimmy
hanna  who's the new yardman
there is iced tea hanna  cucumber sandwiches
yes mr jimmy  an interview  after so many years very exciting
you must think i am terrible hanna
i do not think you anything anymore  just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys
oh shut up  all we did was talk my attack had nothing to do with him
perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold
how are you feeling mr jimmy how is your mind today
i am not forgetting your last brief chat
oh that monster  how could you be working with him
he is not going to kill the old man
she is horrible
you will take them all mr jimmy
i will be fine hanna  thank you
does the yardman come today
who was that at the door
mr boone  he is an interesting friend
i would hardly call our yardman a friend
do you miss having someone to talk to hanna
i have my family  also our lord jesus christ
it needs a hat  there was a widebrimmed cream fedora
i will be out this afternoon remember  your family can visit as long as they like
one likes to live simply
that is my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours  bride of frankenstein
so mr kay  what do you want to know
how much longer before we get to frankenstein
am i correct in assuming mr kay that it is not me you are interested in only my horror pictures
i am not dead yet mr kay
i have a proposal mr kay  this mode of questioning is getting old do not you think
that is funny mr whale
it is is not it  my life as a game of strip poker  shall we play
then the rumors are true
what rumors might those be
george cukor  who made a star is born  i never guessed
do not be shy  there's time to stop before you go too far
can we talk about the horror movies now
certainly mr kay  is there anything in particular you want to know
can that count as one question
of course
okay  frankenstein  tell me everything
he is one of the great images of the twentieth century  as important as the mona lisa
mr whale  are you all right
oh my god  that is wrong mr whale  is it your heart
i was going to take a swim
you did not
i am the one who got you on mr cukor's guest list
you mr kay  how do you know george cukor

bad experiences
you met people
bad people
watched television
bad television
jesus marty you are pathetic it sounds like you need a shockabuku
that is that
it is a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever
i figured i could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock

this night this reunion will be an important step in our relationship
you are fucking psycho
flowers that is funny
as long as i get the laugh
you look beautiful
let me get my coat
do you want to get a drink first
wow i have to give this some thought
no time
even though i left you never left me not just memory but a substance in my blood
like heroin
too junkykitschy deeper deeper
like love
is it something you have done
about five years now
okay great martin that is just great meaning to life mmm
like that there's a point an organic connection between all living things
let me help you along martin you are a sociopath
a sociopath kills for no reason i kill for money
you never could have kept this from me
i was leaving
that is probably a good idea
will you come with me
i am staying here
what if i come back
you do not understand
why do not you want to go to your high school reunion
you went to school with these people
should not you be taking notes
how do you know
i just know
you know where i live
anyway that never use to happen i was always the prodigy now i am just one of the guys
what else say more
okay repeat this after me
i am at home with the me i am rooted in me who is on this adventure
take a deep breath and realize that this is me breathing
how was your day today sir
effective but to tell you the truth i have lost my passion for work
do you like the people you work with
you understand the psychology of the job
well let's just say that sometimes i am right sometimes you are
sometimes i am sometimes it is only natural
what do you want
i am setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts
like a union
like a club work less make more
not me so do not paw at me with your dirty little guild
i want two eggs poached hash brown welldone english muffin for the bread and a coffee
come on live a little i am sorry about the incident yesterday
no harm no foul
i told them to kill you and they did not
hard to get good help these days
is that right
yeah after i shoot you through the fucking forehead i am gonna fuck you in the bullethole
there you go i left it blank
hey ken how have you been
hello martin how have you been
hello bob
i am an attorney i am with moss brice & fromeyer
sometimes i am in divorce mainly some property some personal injury
well i have to take this over to debi
the more things change the more they goddamned well stay the same
i do not think so
that is strictly badermeinhof stuff
i wish he would do his job already so we could do our job
do his job i am not a coldblooded killer
he is falling for her look at him
he using her
you are wrong look at his face
one cannot love and kill
looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us
if he does our job he is our job
wait i have mr grocer for you
do not tease me you know what i do for a living
it is from one of those po boxes how was the trip
tedious i now authorize you to throw away all personal mail
all of it
and not show it to me ever again
that is going to cost
they are not happy sir
i am not happy
they say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep
he did not
they blame you for the compromise
and they want me to make up for it
in detroit this weekend
tell them that is impossible i need my normal lead time
they were very upset
would you describe their position as inflexible
and sir i also get that broken mirror blackcat fridaythe thirteenth kind of feeling about this one
there's nothing to be done about it
i liquidated the last account in zurich and split it into two new ones in estonia
good what else anything interesting
never enough
i have scruples next
do not forget your identity
this is not good
that is it look like
it is fine
you have not looked at the dossier
you have
yes it is the same as usual nothing remarkable about it at all
i have to call the client and give them a reason why you are late
i bought a new rug
that is wonderful mom
that is a revival tent
it is a place where religious people
it is good to see you i am sure you are curious about what i have been doing
i spoke to your father the other day
i imagine that would be rather difficult
they told me you are taking lithium mom
yes they give me headaches i have a headache
you have a headache
i have a headache you have a headache
no i do not have one
we had a good laugh did not we
i think i will go see debi today

he sold me this bad boy
how could you put your hardearned dollars into the hands of the class bully
he gave me a great deal
what the hell happened to you
i was catching up with bob destephano
it did not work out
that is too bad
i have to get my head back into my work
when you see debi tell her i am sorry
to shoot you correct

you mean you hauled him all the way out here just like that
well yes i had a trailer it is not like i made him run along side of the car
does not matter
i do not have a problem with that it is up to annie
well it is worth it really i mean how much longer do you think you need to work with pilgrim
you okay
that is your cue to say you are not laughing at me
oh i see you write both sides of the conversation
does chicago count
you lived in chicago
when i was first married
well i uh you did not
i have decided it is impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat
a jogger huh
i do not jog mr booker i run
lucky for you the grizzlies around here only go for joggers
if i can survive rush hour i figure i can handle grizzlies
you sleeping all right in that house
i thought you lived in chicago
he is beautiful
why do not you ride anymore grace told me you used to ride when she was younger

i understand but annie please
 see what you can do for him 
annie no matter what i do this horse will never be the same
 i just do not know right now do whatever you can and when grace is 
of course not
they are already all settled in frank anyway i am sure annie wants her privacy
i do not believe they will expect that
i believe so saw it on a television show once
i have some brownies left over want one
can we take a look at bronty's foal when we are done here dad
sure as long as she do not mind
he says if you do it soon as they are born it makes them real easy to handle later on
when you figure on branding
teacher asked me why we raise black angusherefords 'stead of pure herefords
now son you tell 'em when it came from
i do not believe it
bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle
they do not get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow and they are good mother
well i would like to welcome annie and grace to their first branding
it would be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month
do not you go to school
why do you always wear that hat
would you let me ride your horse
have you talked to tom about it
of course i have
you would not want to dance with me would you

i prefer to stay in the less frivolous professions
you lasted eight years as orderly in dr lechter's prison ward

and i would like your help determining who's bidding for their purchase
very good
let's just say they got a passion for collectibles
you said here's what utheyu want you to do  why
now why not you help us
we could skip the gavotte
say it in english
lechter's not buying up his memorabilia he keeps it all in his mind do you see
then who's buying it
there's one or two freaks and for a upassu i will rat them out to you 
uthat isu the spirit
are not you afraid of me
you want me to be
let's keep it to business shall we
why have they stuck you on this silly little roust
they did it for a lark
uwhou are these guys
rich comic book freaks
and why is it a vacant exercise
because we both know who's buying the lechteriana
no you are wrong about verger

i have never met a man who was so well beloved
he was uwealthyu
he had nothing  he lived in a garret his work was his life he
who would benefit from his disappearance  unou one  no one has but lost by it
how was america
that is up
doctore carlo fanelli curator of the pallazo capponi 2 months missing
yeah so where is he
somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for information so on
they got that kind of money
what else did i miss
atrocious torture  hit of the season you want i know a guy can get you a ticket
hold up a minute
you spend the afternoon in bed
first things first
you take this much time over everything
can we identify it as dr lechter
not with any certainty we
why did he come back
our operatives in brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of
why did he come back  why did the boy turn back
are you alright sir
he turned back into the room  where have we seen it before
udou it
where was the call from
somewhere in italy
make plans for lechter's abduction
then we will not need to tether miss starling as our lure
if you would see him monument look around you
he escaped
what do you want me to do
thank you  and how are you this evening doctor no we know that you are awake
it will not be long now sir
he do not like popcorn

agent starling would you come with me
the children
they are from baltimore
i have never heard that he
it is not something he wants to publicize ma'am  it is just something he does
i will not take much of his time
what would uthatu be
he would consider it a favor if he could make a udonationu  to a charitable institution of your choice 
now why in the world would he do that
i think he was he was utouchedu by your reaction  to his appearance
do you know the uselleru
we have subpoenaed the auction house's records
try barney clark
he is
he was the orderly during dr lechter's stay in prison
and how would you know that
before the change mr verger was he made quite a study 
you should get the kids a udogu
i hardly uthinku so after the incident

mr verger would be pleased to make a contribution to the charitable
no i think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates
young boys still

he saw the truth and uspokeu it
i am afraid this wine is making me woozy
thank you cordell
but will that satisfy you
you do not wish to ubegu
would that add to your umirthu
the girl could use some help
you are ufreeu
might i make a suggestion
when i 
that is that baby
alcohol  where both its lifeenhancing and its life destroying qualities  not unlike some hindu ugodu
i guess the only thing is suck it up
our mister ufrendleru to to to humiliate me though
what else's he goin to do with his day he cannot work and he will not steal
look what they put her on

you got a lot of people love you starling
trouble is they all seem to udieu
y'want to gimme brigham's pistol
what would you guess ardelia
you goin to shoot yourself 
the purpose of the exercise is it because they are uexpensiveu
they are not expensive you got them through your connections speaking of which
fine thank you but
speaking of which i want you also to get us tickets for the opera
whatever is within my upoweru
and that is what you need to expand
i do not understand
we are here on sufferance  i am here
why are we here in the ufirstu place
my love
they asked us to dinner  how can we accept if we cannot ureturnu the
no  invite us  no he simply
because we do not have any money
because we do not have any mmm
ask me when we get home
and then we are going to ugreeceu
yes but the uimportantu thing as i have said
what did you want 
i know where he is
i am sure i do not know who you mean
i know where he is
and why should we believe you
i know something no one knows  he has had his finger removed  on his left hand  it left a scar 
what shape is the scar
i want the money
what shape is the scar
an honor  carlo pazzi
no y'know i never udoubtedu it
you were kind enough today to take my photograph
hey lost again
but perhaps there is some some less radical solution
i am sure there is but my young friend here would ukillu you 
his feelings do him honor  and i have come simply to pay my urespectsu to the great clarice starling 
the great and ubeautifulu
thank you
or clear your windshield with it
this one is my favorite  it has not title  they should call it fetch whaddaya think
i know it well
udou you  what does that mean
yeah i am sure it is famed for lotsa things and you are one'a'them
but  this particular statue
what are they on about
they are grilling the applicant for the vacant post
speaking of the vacant post
a uliaisonu position
and what does uthatu mean
i feel that
she must be something special after dark
i cannot remember  i have got to make some money
thirty thousand dollars reward  in the whereabouts of il dottore fanelli or the apprehension of his
tell me why
i am sorry i do not mean to be impolite because you know you cannot understand
and to have udoneu it means can mean to accept not only udangeru but ubetrayalu
that is right
and uhumiliationu  what is this new job they have
i do not uthinku so
then what brings you back
ubarteru with her  to appeal to her and you feel that
no i do not uthinku so
your father  it is not utheyu who
what does uthatu mean
i saw a man today a man so hideously deformed who will spend his life in a hospital bbb
yes so you said  but what does that mean  to go beyond the institution
if uheu could overcome his need for for selfuratificationu
would you use a small word
for approval
how do you think that made him feel  what does that umeanu to go beyond the institution 
i told that woman i am an orphan
you uareu an orphan
yes but no one is in control of their emotions  that is all we have time for today 
what is your point
i want to do something upositiveu
he was ushotuhe was shot  on his rounds  and and
and you have been udreamingu dreaming about this hat and
for the uworstu hurt of course that which will not heal is the conviction no one cares
because if it was not you then perhaps it was dr lechter trying to reclaim his own property
and why would you suspect me of this ghoulishness
because sir you are the only one of his victims who lived  and because you have large resources
my encounter

hey lieutenant the boys in robbery have something i think you should look at
what is it
that is not all lieutenant  wait until you see the tape  it is unbelievable

lieutenant you are really frightening me
good evening lieutenant

yes  i think it is
you will have no need for that highlander
since we hardly know each other i am sure you will understand if i hold one to it for awhile
no  he was my brother  he died at anothers hand
we too are brothers macleod  in fact you have more family than you think
who are you
thomas cavenaugh  i am a teacher of sorts  like romeriz i help those newly acquainted with our life
i learned my fill from romeriz

it is a beautiful day  i am merely enjoying it
cannot you enjoy it quietly

i hear you
the river
that is what bothers me
i am leaving
leaving what
england  there is nothing for me here anymore
and what do you think you will find in another land
maybe myself
thank you thomas
for being a friend when i needed one i hope our paths cross again
i am sure they will
as friends  always as friends
we cannot write our destiny macleod in the end it could be you and me
that is a thought that does not please me

what do you think
i think my sarah fancies you conner

if it is good advice
this is  go home  stay out of this
where did you get it

why do you stare at me like that
i do not have any answers for you
who was that man last night
i do not know
do you always walk around with a sword
about what
it probably would not interest you it is something i read in a mythology book
i am interested in mythology
good evening
you did not answer my question
i am just trying to place you
you are not an easy person to get to know
why  because i do not give up all my secrets
how come you wanted to meet tonight
that makes you uncomfortable
a little  yes  my interest in coming here is profession
is it
yes  it is
alright  in the shop you mentioned something about
the calan  do you know who they are
why not
because i do not feel like sitting in a rubber room for fortyeight hours
that would mean they would been trapped in there
for three hundred years
how could that be  people do not live for three hundred years
would you like to see it
i have seen it
on the back it has
the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word  courage
you wanted the truth  now you have it
where will you go now
it will end tonight

he is in there
what now
now i can start to live  to feel to grow old and live each day without the promise of another

even if i were inclined i have had better  and a lot safer  opportunities to kill off a wife
three times to be exact
excuse me
where is it
i am sorry 
upstairs too come with me i will show you another body a friend of mine named schecter 
 what was he doing here
oh really who
if there really is someone else in this house i think the four of us can handle the situation
nice touch pritchett subtle
this thing's going nowhere
yeah what the hell i will go
 i did down here
should not somebody like stand guard or something  just in case
i will stay if it will ease your mind
i wanna know first to what do i owe this honor i mean i never even heard of this guy
'less the place really is haunted
you are totally full of shit are not you
you said that was an accident
so what you are saying we are stuck here the rest of our lives
a cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 930 tomorrow morning  i think the power of the house fades at dawn
 well let's hear it for small miracles 
so you are saying as long as that door stays locked we are okay
hey where would you guys go
that is down there

is shealright
and you are not really as large and useless as you seem
i am better than that
most fun i have had all day
what deep down inside
start with the name you were born with and we will work forward from there
i told you already jennifer jenzen executive vp of 
i do not think so
there's always exceptions
well she went somewhere she did not just up and disappear into thin air
what the hell good is fixing that gonna get us
an answer i hope exactly what  or who  melissa was taping
you hear somebody
we can do it
sure with three days and a blowtorch
it is a thousand years old  we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage  the sucker will pop
no prob i will just hop down the hardware store 
 no the basement  the room with all the controls to this thing big long iron levers just lying there 
 not a chance  there's too much weirdness down there i do not think even bullets are gonna stop
i was upstairs with eddie 
 that is the fact bud 
 you lose either way price 
i think we should have taken a right back there
good point
what are you looking for
cheery looking bunch
or an online computer
that is crazy
this is the best we are gonna do
it is okay everything's okay now
do not think it is even an issue
the opening's still too small we will never get through
no it is just trying to frighten us
you okay
yeah and under other abnormal circumstances i think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones
better put it on hold until we find pritchett
jesus h christ
so what the thing with the glass price did that
melissa margaret marr celebrity
then what the hell are we doing here
do not touch me
i am impressed i do not think evelyngs ever said those words to anything with genitalia
could we have a word
well not quite see those people down there they are not the ones i invited
then who are they
you tell me i do not know how you managed to hack into my mac but bravo
what are you talking about you think i invited them
sure know it was not me and if you say it was not you  then who the hell did evelyn
which part of that fantasy turns you on most me with other men  or just the other men
 just not always in the sexual sense
you are hurting me
huh and here i had a completely different theory
really well let it rip
oh nonono  much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch 
 the sadistic prick 
so how is a girl to know if these things are loaded baby
and where are we off to mr price check the wiring on the animatronic mummies
fine with me just somebody then better go and round up melissa marr
where is she
 i pose you the same question 
 and who's next on your list
if i had one evelyn i think you know who would be first and last 
 oh for chrissake that is a given we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here 
 that was not my original plan but it is starting to look more attractive 
question answered
i do not know ms jenzen

problem where looked good to me
dummy 6 keeps losing his arm

the lockdown thing
i mean not that it did not give evelyn the kind of coronary i had in mind just
 it was not me
rewind that
i was just sitting here  it happened i had nothing to do with it
then who did
no idea i did not even know the damn thing still worked
it works
maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart
no somehow  i do not know how  she did it
pretty amazing feat all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time
wish i could take the credit but 
 guess we know where mr price is now
of course he did for god's sake  did not he mr pritchett
oh no
do not know that it does
well then how about maybe we call someone
will not do any good
and you think it is in there
you coming or are you waiting for blackburn
blackburngs dead
excuse me
pritchett what is going on
he must have unsealed the room
for the love of godplease
 i am coming 
i feel something  it is faint butit is there
damn it
that is the matter
it does not say  but that is not what interests me  there's no death certificate for the daughter  anywhere
so many unanswered questions  why was she buried there  and who killed her
it might have been her mother
they do not build them like this anymore
town records are coming up now
what will they tell you
i have to admit i was skeptical  until now
so was i  the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not
well i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us
it looks delicious
are you all right
a few years older perhaps
it will heal
i am sorry
may you find the peace you have sought in vain for so long

why does this have to be so hard
good morning miss
she must have been beautiful  what happened to her alma
she was very sick and then she went mindless miss
that is this
things so bad nobody can help  not even doctor maxwell
doctors and nurses can only do so much alma  they cannot cure everything
doctors that are people cannot cure everything
what do you mean  doctors that are people
at the houmfort
you mean mama rose was like mrs holland
no  she was mindless but not like miss jessica  but the houngan cured her
no miss  he is just as he was in the beginning  on the front part of an enormous boat
but they came to a beautiful place did not they
i think you need some help
i would love to
use your influence with paul  ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table
i have no influence with mr holland
some of this native nonsense the houngan has his prescription and dr maxwell and i have ours
you have never said anything about voodoo before mrs rand
have not i  i suppose i take it for granted it is just part of everyday life here
you do not believe in it
frankly my dear i did not expect anything like this from a nice levelheaded girl  what are you driving at
mrs rand
wait do not draw any conclusions let me explain
but how did you get here what are you doing here
why betsy  we cannot lose you you mean too much to us here
mrs rand
she can never be cured
i have never heard of a cure
i prepared these for you last night miss connell
miss connell's testimony will be very important
where were you trained
the west indies
a year's contract  a trip with all expenses paid  that is not so bad you know
but it is so far away
is she a doctor
no  she just runs the place she is everything else  amazing woman mother  you will like her
i like her already
and that   is my chair  and this   is miss connell  who is beautiful
thank you  but who sits there 
 but you are an american
i went to school in buffalo  paul went to school in england
do not worry  i was not missed  the only important man here is the owner
mr holland
yes the redoubtable paul  he has the plantation and i as you must have noticed have all the charm
i do not know  he spoke to me last night on the boat i liked him very much
perhaps you ought to get on to the mill
where do you think you are going
it is my day off
but what in the world can you do with a day off in st sebastian
but do not you have to work
bring me another tijoseph  i have to keep the lady entertained
it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum
what in the world are you talking about  six ounces  
higher mathematics  two ounces to a drink  three drinks six ounces
do not let it bother you so wes
that does not sound like him
that is right  he is playing the noble husband for you is not he that will not last long
betsy can i talk to you a minute
she hated sleep  she used to say it was a thief  stealing away her life an hour at a time
she is dead  the dead ought to be buried
but she is not dead wes
you know what she is  that is death  no mind no senses  no love no hate no feeling  nothing
it is not beautiful
have the servants made you comfortable
cannot i take it for you
i heard someone crying  a woman 
why was the maid crying
i am not sure i can make you understand  you know what this is
i made it clear in my letter to the company  this is not a position for a frightened girl
i am not a frightened girl
and what is so alarming about the tower miss connell
nothing  really  but you must admit it is an eerie sort of place  so dark 
surely nurses are not afraid of the dark
a mental case
you did not find your patient so frightening in the daylight did you
mrs holland must have been beautiful 
i suppose so  yes
and charming
i have never given it much thought
good morning miss connell
i heard about your little misadventure yesterday miss connell  on your first day off too
well i had a good time up to a point
wesley can be very entertaining
but for wes  it must be a temptation to him
i heard you playing
why did you come in here
you did not drive her mad
do not take it to heart betsy
and instead  i came  bringing you nothing
i wanted to help you
help me how
i told you
because you wanted to give my wife back to me  why should that mean anything to you
you know why  you saw it the other night at the piano  you turned away from me
you think i love jessica and want her back it is like you to think that  clean decent thinking
she was beautiful
i still cannot believe it paul  that you would not say a word in your own defense
i can understand that  everyone feels that way about someone
you wanted to warn me
the night you came to me in this room  to comfort me to help me  i turned you away
do not paul  do not doubt yourself  do not make me doubt you
i remember words i said to jessica  words mixed like to poison  to hurt her to madden her
considering that the paper is three months old and this is not sunday  no thank you
i would not worry too much commissioner  it will pass  we have had this sort of thing before
this is something else  they are curious  curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture

if it was not raining we could take him outside and blow him up
well  it looks like someone got to his private parts before us
communist viet cong
it feels warm
i love you
that is nice are you drunk
i do not know how do i know
where is miss wollsten
but the gods played a little trick on me i was born in switzerland
he is exhausted
i need your advice  something has happened  mr  jacks 
drunk again
i wonder if my editor's psychic reports from the greek front are going to be a little vague
i would like to very much  but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland
i will go up and take a look at the general  perhaps sit with him
he will not even know you are there he is delirious
go ahead i will wake you up when i go to bed then you can watch him
she is right this is hardly the time to bandy old tales
we will see who is the first to die
i suppose you want to hear my prayer to hermes
 you feel the symptoms
i am here the general is here you are not alone
they were gore before i came here
perhaps i had better stay i am tired
did you hear what thea said  as if she knew what threatens us
that is impossible i told them jacks died of a sudden heart attack probably brought on by over drinking
no  she shall not be left here
you were singing were not you a beautiful voice miss st aubyn
i adore hearing thea sing  but my poor head's beginning to ache  i am so sorry
i am glad you and the general did not have to leave us we would feel quite deserted
how could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here
good night oliver
you are not leaving tomorrow
where is thea
oh no  it is too delicious you are making it up
tell me about them thea they have great wings end long teeth 
sharp shiny teeth  and they creep up to your bed 
my father  i am alone oliver completely alone
poor cathy 
there's no reason to decide any of us are going to die
poor child these must be horrible days for you
has that girl  has thea ever told you where she comes from
has she spoken to you of her father and her mother
she has never mentioned her family
what are you doing
miss wollsten shares the room with you
shh it is all right  i will be all right
the young man mr davis seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
you are fortunate in your father
cathy  how does it feel to have a father
what an odd question
i mean does one love a father because he is good and kind or just because he is one's father
i do not know him but i have seen him
what is it  what are you talking about
i have forgotten it dear
but one must love a father
i felt he did not like me
you should sleep cathy lie down and close your eyes try to forget everything
when i close my eyes i see miss wollsten i cannot think of anything else
suppose she is not dead suppose it was a cataleptic attack
i wish i did not have such bitter knowledge of you cathy
miss wollsten
your father knew it too but he was never sure how much was pretense
you were father's secretary  i never thought  
what would i be thinking
mr davis seems a good prospect young handsome sympathetic  ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you  
why i am fond of thea
you are planing something cathy but i will not let you  i will warn them against you
you will not say one single word i know your secret
would you care to explain what you are talking about
you have been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against thea
when i tell him that you are unfit to live a normal life with normal people  a cataleptic
you would not tell that 
no no i will not believe it he is not dead
this is dr drossos chief medical officer of my division
because he was a brave man  because i liked him  i came here to be sure
i do not understand you
i do not want to be buried alive if i die i want to be sure  quite sure
if you should fall sick we will be careful you need not worry
no i want more than that i beg you general make sure drive a knife through my heart  anything
i do not really know where thea comes from the viceconsul at adrianople brought her to me
you do not know her last name  you do not know from where she came
your daughter is ill
she is not too well
what is her illness
nothing really she is been under a great strain  the journey  the battle 
was she ill before that girl came into your household
you know that sound oliver
do you mind if i go with you
there's no one there  nothing but the caves and the dead
she is not there the coffin is gone
there is something evil about her
it makes me fear her
i cannot understand that
well at any rate i would like to say goodbye to the girl
i have seen men die drunk  and i have seen men die of the plague
plague there's no possibility of that is there
until we know what choice is there we have to stay
but the war the army  they need you
better no general than one carrying the plague
we still do not know that it is the plague 
thea is so like her  in every feature 
is this what you wanted to speak to me about
in a way  this girl thea you must stay away from her
i had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why
that is ridiculous  thea's lovely gentle 
listen to what i say 
i have had command for the last time 
come  you will feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island
daughter  my daughter 
you are crying why
i do not know everything's so mixed up 
that is bothering you thea is it the general
please you should not laugh 
thea that is wrong
he keeps asking for the name of my father and mother
well tell him
i cannot
why in the world cannot you
thea what is this what are you trying to tell me he stole your mother 
because she loved him  i know him thea believe me he is not a cruel man
how fast does this go

what else you got
let's see  you got a minute
come on phil do not jerk me around
fantastic lady  do not know what i would do without her
me neither
y'know brody  for the first time in years it is worth putting money into this town
may i have this dance
wait a minute
too late it is written
is jeff hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim chief of police in your absence
what are you all blind  it is a shark  look  teeth jaw gills
is that what it is
what have you seen before  this is nothing  seaweed  mud  some thing in the lens
is that what it is  dollars money  i will pay for it  take it out of my salary
as soon as i heard about it i called you  this thing is big his arms indicate big
look at that
length 22 feet 8 inches
come on let's check the bite radius
the what
bite radius  you know the size of the mouth
the whale's mouth
the shark's mouth
the shark that did this  it was a shark was not it
we do not know that do we
but that is what we are here to find out right
could be a shark  but maybe not
look i know a little bit about sharks
do you
carcharadon carcharias
that is it
okay so that is it
is there one in these waters
what makes you think there might be
because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish
this is a mammal not a fish
that is it  probably  look sharks are attracted by blood and thrashing around
sound  like sonar or radar they home in on irregular sounds unusual sounds any rhythmic low frequency vibration
it is either a great white or another killer whale
look  can great white sharks communicate  send out signals or something  you know take revenge sense an enemy

that is hard to imagine
i could take some time off
you are always taking time off
i borrow it without telling him
will not you get in trouble
only if he finds out it is a short hop to the caribbean  we could take a few days
there must be plenty of women who would be glad to go
because it would not occur to you to know why  blushing suits you
i am sorryi
there's nothing to be sorry about
you sure you do not need glasses
i tried to tell youi tried

where is lenny
gone to ben masters' place  cow tipping
cow tipping
claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows  they are not giving milk
i will take care of it
after what you have seen today you really think your son could be alive
this is how you make dinosaurs
do you think it goes all the way across
oh my god
what is it
first off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts amanda and i have admired your work for years
well i am no aviation specialist but i do know it is hell of a lot lower than anyone else
he says it is a bad idea
we cannot just
how much weight have you lost
twenty twentyfire pounds i have been swimming at the y
you hate to swim
you look good
stop that dr grant says this is dangerous territory
well we should split up or something we can cover twice the area
no dr grant says
dr grant says this dr grant says that
well that is the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him
because dr grant is not looking for eric dr grant is looking for the coast
fineand when the tricyclatops comes after you do not come crying to me
what did you say
that is him thats eric
i am sorry amanda i am and i am sorry for the things i said about him
no it is
i know you liked ben i had no right to
it is not safe
i do not know i do not have it with me
when did you have it last
sweetheart you are okay  you are okay  you are okay
eric its okay you will be right behind me
paul where is he can you see him
my own kid was right in front of me and i did not do a damn thing
you could not have made that jump
i should have tried it should have been me on that beach back there not billy
how would you have helped eric  he needs you paul he needs us
he could have died
we should try fishing again
you mean it
either that or the government will firebomb it back to the stone age
you see that is just the thing paul and i have special permission to fly low
he is with a man named ben hildebrand
he is right a predator would not leave a kill wounded
we need to stick to the plan head for the coast
what about eric and dr grant
going to the coast was alangs idea if he is alive thats where he is headed
you had the phone the whole time
where is dad
we have to keep looking for dad we have to
i know i know i want to look for him too
that was isla nublar this is isla sorna the second island
so mr kirby tell me when you climbed k2 did you base camp at 25 or 30000 feet
thirtythousand i think closer to the top
they couldnt climb up so they were trying to get us to come down
i dont know
i thought you were an expert
how was your trip profitable
we will be broke in four weeks
absolutely not
that does sound lucky
it was this strap alone that saved my life got caught on a rock as i was falling
i am so use to seeing bones it is weird to see skin
is it a rex
how would you classify it
obviously a superpredator  suchimimus that snout
not with that sail  spinosaurus aegypticus
i do not remember that on ingengs list
it looks intact
we could cowrite a paper
we need to keep moving
alan i want to tell you that i am so sorry about the
he used to know me
so mark's working at the state department now
anything good
raptors mostly
you remember the sounds they made
you think they could talk to each other
times change alan but you are the still the best i mean that
i would better get going
let me know if i can help alan youre bad about asking for help but please ask me anything anytime
okay goodbye ellie
a wellaccepted theory
eric your parents are both here
in costa rica
they will never make it i mean they cannot manage when the cable goes out
you are alan grant are not you  i read both of your books
which one do you prefer
the first one before you where on the island you liked dinosaurs back then
when ingen cleared out they left a lot of stuff behind
found this but the battery's dead
is that all it is been i thought it was longer
know what this is
a raptor claw i use to have one a fossil
we need to head for the coast
do you have any kids
it is strikes me now i never told her that
you should
eric do you know what happened to the boat that brought you here why did it crash
no i could not see
we are safe
what do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs
you know i have been traveling and i am very tired maybe some other time
dr grant if you would just sit tight we will explain this all in a jiffy
what the hell is going on what are they doing
we needed somebody who knew the lay of the land somebody who would been to this island before
i have never been on this island
well that is good
you  tell me roland when was the last time you answered your phone
but alone  we always had great success together you and i
just a little bit too much i think
it matches the pictures
you hear something
minimal is too much   it has to be light it has to be strong 
light and strong light and strong sure why not it is only impossible god save me from academics
you are an academic
former academic  now i actually make things  i do not just talk
you think i am all talk eddie
it does not matter what i think
why did not you tell us about these guys ian
i did not know you  were not well
it is the lawyers  the lawyers are finally killing me
well  did not it all seem a trifle compact to you
it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen
do you have chromium tapes  the others fog in high
ingen is a genetics corporation is not it
are you looking for a problem
that was a pair bond  a family group even long after that infant was nestbound
the empty shells are crushed and trampled  the young stay in the birth environment that is conclusive
ian you are not insane  i am so glad
why would not they  look at hyenas jackals nearly all species of predator birds 
that does not say a thing about trex they could have been rogues  robert burke certainly thinks they were
hi dad
stop saying fantastic  where are you going
i cannot tell you  but i will be back within a week
my vacation is over in a week
i will make it up to you this summer i promise
i am your daughter all the time you know  not just when it is convenient
very hurtful  your mother tell you to say that
is that kid still bothering you
which one
you know at the bus stop  with the hair
that was about a year ago
well is he
no  richard talked to his parents
i could come with you
this is nothing like austin  forget about it
how could you possibly
ingen  that is ingen
where does it say that
what are you guys gonna do
are you all right  anything broken
i am fine i am fine i was scared i thought you are you okay
cancel that dieter
carnivores hunt near stream beds  do you want to set up base camp or an allyoucaneat people bar
where do you think you are going
how close do you have to be
forty yards  less maybe  i assume it will take a slug in the brain case to bring him down
killing lessons  heartwarming
had to  to keep him still for the trip
what in christ's name is going on
what is
where is the power and radio setup
it is behind us
if i do not move i cannot shoot it
i did not tell anything i told the truth
you version of it
there are no versions of the truth this is not a corporate maneuver it is my life
we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries
trespassing sabotage  you could go to jail just for being here did you know that
their what
you know how to work a radio do not you
she is gutty
no way
do you see any family resemblance here
then this is our chance
it has a broken leg
so do it a favor and put it out of its misery
what do they want
what are they
come on
where is kelly
we cannot stay in here
we are sure as hell not going back out there
this is singlewall construction it is just a shack
it will hold
head for the roof
i have to find kelly
i think she is with sarah
something's wrong
you ever heard of gambler's ruin
just  flawed  very deeply flawed
why did you come here
so that others would know about this place
why should they
because it exists
it will still exit if they go on not knowing will not it
yes  and people will live in the absence of truth
how many rounds did you find for that weapon
four counting the one in the chamber
lighten up ian you sound like a high school viceprincipal
no  we are an independently funded expedition
funded by whom
can you set up
it has to be temporary something that will break apart and fall off as the animal grows
that is impossible they cannot have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here
born free as free as the wind blows as free as the grass grows 
are you insane
so that is your story nick
i was a cameraman for nightline for six years been freelance since '91 do a lot of work for greenpeace
that must be interesting  what drew you there
women  about eighty percent female in greenpeace
hey i would not want to spook the woolly mammoths
iangs a very good friend of mine
he does not need a friend he needs a shrink
 way we could safely 
ruining everything that is what they are doing  you could choke on the diesel smoke already
hold it down nick
where is kelly
we have to send someone to look for him
ask her
you have got to be kidding
uh   mr hammond  
you are sure we have to
visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage
so how much for our first tour  two noshows and one sick triceratops
the door security systems are shutting down
woah woah woah what the hell what the hell
what now
fences are failing all over the park  a few minor systems he said
find nedry  check the vending machines
phones are out too
are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours i mean that is hanging us up
i ran a key check on every stroke nedry entered today it is all pretty standard stuff until this one  
how many lines of code are there
uh   about two million
no no no that is crazy you are out of your mind he is absolutely out of his mind  
but would we get the phones back
how would we cut off the lysine
how long will this take
oh i will get 'em all
remember   viable embryos  they are no use to us if they do not survive
what  no menthol
i was wondering how are you planning to beat the security
alan  where are we going  you see something
yours was fully illustrated honey
imbalance disorientation labored breathing  seems to happen about every six weeks or so
yes mitotic pupils should be constricted
these are dilated  take a look
they are  i will be damned
yes  we know they are toxic but the animals do not eat them
are you sure
pretty sure
there's only one way to be positive  i need to see some droppings  i have to see the dinosaur's droppings
i have samples all over the kitchen 
there you are  out you come
oh my god
fascinating animals fascinating
oh my god
malcolm's okay for now  i gave him a shot of morphine
mr arnold  he is not answering me  okay i am on the grating
four complete skeletons    such a small area   the same time horizon  
they died together
the taphonomy sure looks that way
a drought  the lake was shrinking  
postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments  velociraptor
you know if you really wanted to scare the kid you could have just pulled a gun on him
oh ellie look  they are noisy they are messy they are sticky they are expensive
cheap cheap cheap
they smell
oh my god they do not  they do not smell
they do smell  some of them smell babies smell
alright the one on the airplane had an accident but usually babies do not smell
they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous
the what
the cretaceous
anything else you old fossil
yeah plenty  some of them cannot walk
okay who's the jerk
and what are those
why would they care what we think
the movement
you have got a trex  he is got a trex  a trex  he said he is 
ellie they are absolutely   they are moving in herds they do move in herds
we were right
so what are you thinking
wait a minute  how do you interrupt the cellular mitosis
oh ellie  it is so beautiful  it is the most beautiful thing i ever saw
ellie i have been thinking there's something about the periodicity does not had up
constantly sick
not just every six weeks
elm that is it it explains the periodicity the  
  the undigested state of the berries because it is  
  like birds  
  like birds  what happen is they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs  
  a gizzard  
  which is called a gizzard and it helps them mash their food but what happens after a while  
  what happens is that after a while the stones get smooth every six weeks so the animal regurgitates them  
  barfs them up  
are you sure
it is just the two raptors right  you are sure the third one's contained
ellie   get back and boot up the door locks
you cannot hold it by yourself
ellie get the gun  try to reach the gun
ellie com one
do you see anything
what about the lysine contingency  we could put that into effect
i cannot wait anymore  something went wrong  i am going to go get the power back on
okay i am on channel two
c'mon on this way
no we cannot
why not
it is all right
that is right  will break through
i get ah  
i know it is very exciting
and scary
and scary
when people try to control things that it is out of their power  
god creates dinosaurs  god destroys dinosaurs  god creates man  man destroys god  man creates dinosaurs
you see  the tyrannosaur does not obey set patterns or park schedules  it is the essence of chaos
alan listen to this
  on your hand the amount of blood distending in your vessels imperfections in the skin  
oh imperfections
can we chance moving him
faster faster
must go faster it is getting closer  must go faster
seven days  seven days  oh great  oh good   clever
  shut up
hola juanito
that is this i hear at the airport hammond's not even here
grant  you will never get him out of montana
why not
i cannot see
up and down up and down
i cannot believe we invited ian malcolm
hey  where did you find those things
in a box under my seat
the full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place
this is overwhelming john  are these characters  animatronics
john we   what i am just saying
  from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year  
that is conservative of course  there's no reason to speculate wildly
have a heart gentlemen  their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion
i read your book
tim  which car were you planning on  
these look kind of familiar
are you okay  can you move  tim  are you okay
tim are you okay
i am stuck  the seat's got my feet
i threw up
okay that is not so bad ah tim
me too  okay  well the main thing about climbing is never never look down never
this is impossible  how am i goingi cannot make it this isit is about fifty feet
so am i going to help you with your foot
'course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help
that is a good idea
you will probably be safe enough  on your own 
i doubt it
straighta brainiac
what do you call a blind dinosaur
i do not know  what do you call a blind dinosaur
a doyouthinkhesaurus what do you call a blind dinosaur's dog
you got me
take a bite take a bite  i am not letting go

you know what this is  it is a dinosaur egg  the dinosaurs are breeding
but   my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls
i cannot  i am scared
go go go jump
are you crazy  what if you miss  i hate it up here
so you two dig up dinosaurs
cloning from what  loy extraction has never recreated an intact dna strand
to grant she is uh   tenacious
you have no idea
you got any kids
you are married
what would i touch
you have not touched  did not touch anything  we are stopping  we have stopped
i must have touched something  this happens all the time it must be my fault  machines hate me
machines hate you
yeah they hate me
their radio's out too  gennaro said to stay put
the kids okay
well i did not ask  why would not they be
kids get scared
that is to be scared about  it is just a little hiccup in the power
i did not say i was scared
i did not say you were scared
where does he think he is going
keep absolutely still   it is visiongs based on movement
oh my god
we gotta do something
what  what can we do
hey we were saving that
for today i guarantee it
and who in god's name do you think you are
no i am sorry that  would not be possible  we have just discovered a new skeleton and  
i could compensate you by fully funding your dig
  this would be an awfully unusual time  
that thing's got a what twentyfive twentyseven foot neck
cannot you stop these things
sorry  it is kind of a ride
mr hammond i have decided not to endorse your park
tim  lex
he is knocked out  he is knocked out  dr grant  dr grant  daddy daddy
he left us  he left us
liar  you said you would not leave
it is safe
it is safe
it is safe
hear that  are you hearing this
tim tim tim
oh i hate the other kind
what are you gonna do now if you do not have to dig of dinosaur bones any more
what if the dinosaur comes back while we are all asleep
i will stay awake
all night
go away
i like cows
let's go
c'mon tim move down damn it
do as he says  the power's coming back timmy
timmy let go  you are gonna have to let go  count to three  i will catch you
shhhh  tim i am right here below you  easy catch one two three  you count it yourself  one two three  
timmy listen to dr grant
what works
john does not subscribe to chaos particularly what it has to say about his little science project
codswollop  ian you have never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island
a load if i may say so of fashionable number crunching thats all it is
john john
do not do that
that will teach you to trust grandpa
i am sorry about your financial problems  i really am but they are your problems
you are right john  you are absolutely right everything's my problem
i will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you dennis  i really will not
i do not think there's been any debate  there's no debatemy mistakes
i do not blame people for their mistakes but i do ask that they pay for them
why did not i build in orlando
i will keep an eye on it  maybe it will swing south like the last one
sustain winds 45 knots
tell them when they get back to the cars
we miss you
thanks for the presents
i am sorry   i am sorry  
i do not know i do not know  i am sorry  
why did you do this
why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong
i hate trees
they do not bother me
no no sh sh sh   stop  stop stop  do not let the monsters come over here
they are not monsters lex they are just animals  and these are herbivores
that is not funny
jump timmy  it is too late
you are gonna get electrocuted  electrified  the power's coming back
ken it is bruce listen we have got a nibble on the pendleton financing
fifty we need seventyfive
you tell them if they come up to seventyfive i will cut them in on the crystal lake package
chain saws
you want to put in chain saws
i do not think the people who live around here would like that very much
do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninetyeight percent in the last ten years
no but
and do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks crystal lake is filled with corpses
beautiful trees sturdy trunks lots of branches  we can do some great logging up here
logging we will need an environmental impact study for that
jesus christ
just a deer mister biller part of the local wildlife
i think we are lost
i did not think there were any houses up here
structure might be salvageable let's see what the interior looks like
mister biller now that we can see the lake i think we should follow the shoreline to 
there does not seem to be any water damage kind of cozy actually
i really think we should go back
who is this that is going on
this is janet davenport  i am the realtor
i do not know
what about that other guy
other guy
janet are you okay are you there
he he is here
oh my god this is his house _we are in his fucking house_
janet goddamnit that is going on
i seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murderone charges
quite a circus
three  where is my client
your client is being booked right now he will be in cell five
i thought that was ted bundy
that is right it it came right out of his chest
who's chest
now i think the video store's open for another couple of hours let's go
so why cannot jason get a fair trial
because everyone knows he is guilty
you think that is going to work
you watch this garbage
zombie sluts from beyond the grave
he is fucking nuts
doesnit sleep
insomnia not unusual for someone in his situation  not to mention he is a bedwetter
he wets the bed
nurses that is why i went into medicine
this sexual obsession of yours have you considered going into therapy yourself
i do not rationalize anything i am his lawyer  he is my client that is all
not much here jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia that is about it
so jason does not sleep how does that help us
not guilty by reason of insanity case closed
there's a pizza place over on market
cute waitresses
that is open to debate
there's nothing to see here he sleeps we record it that is all that happens
i think i am onto something joe
me too i am drunk
see this
yeah what is it
it is as though there were two people in that room both of them asleep both of them dreaming
that does not make sense
add it to the list
great	when can you do it
what are you doing
this is jasongs rem pattern and this is the boy's rem pattern they are identical
where is he going
i do not know but i think he is pissed
you know how to use one of those
i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid
krueger's in the real world maybe he is mortal like us
and if he is not
so you think it might counteract krueger's ability to make us hallucinate
ten cc's of this shit and you will not be dreaming about anything
how long will the effect last
about ten minutes
ten minutes
are you all right
what happened where is jason
bree  honey  please we are waiting for someone
arlyn he just wanted to ask some questions  something you could help us about
honey a couple of years ago with jane and frankie  jane sent me a dumper 
please if he sees you he will not come
arlyn just tell me did jane have a dumper one of her regular johns
what about him yes
why she is a junkie
enjoy  well 
it is good to see you well  could we do it first and then just talk
sure dear yes
maybe this was not just a trick maybe you are in danger of real love real involve 
do not belong
well i have to close up now
look  could i use your phone
yes indeed
look i almost killed my  i almost killed someone
miss daniel be sensible you find another place till we get things cleaned up
oh well that should not take you more than another oh two and a half or three years should it
a few more days we know who did this
so do i
arlyn and jane commited suicide he said they commited suicide
now there's a picture i would like you to 
you said someone killed them you said you know who you said that
well we are pretty 
why is not he locked up
we do not want to just lock him up we want a conviction we wanted him to do something more
is that why klute did not tell me
i guess he figured it was better
what was better i made better bait
i do not have to look at anything i do not have 
oh no
like for you to look for the man
yes  all right 
you have no idea what i am talking about
yes  jane mckenna's book  i could make a phone call
i am not going to hurt you absolutely i am not
i am sorry i am just frightened yes
excuse me miss daniel
i said yes i see
oh no i do not think 
what is it
what about
my name's john klute
you said that
will you let me ask you some questions
is it the shakedown hon you picked a loser i just do not have it
could i ask some questions
company outing or picnic or something like that
you remind me of my uncle
but you cannot say that dumper was tom grunemann
is that how you get most of your dates someone gives your name to someone else
most of them
is that how you met the dumper  someone else gave 
how would i remember
how else do you meet them pimps 
i have some names the police gave me frank ligourin will you tell me what 
look i am sure this will amuse you too ilia trying to get away from all that
gee i hope this does not make my cold any worse
tell me about frank ligourin
you have changed your mind you do want to play
tell me about acting  what are you doing tomorrow  where do you go
i go on rounds
well do you think it was him
what do you think
cannot you get him
maybe if you tell me the things you have not
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper  frank sent me on it
do you know where he got the dumper
he never told me
what did you expect frankie still has a good string three girls figure three hundred a week from each
did not he tell you what you wanted
it did not go anywhere  but that is not why 
about the dumper did not he tell you that
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper
i thought you were going back to the apartment
oh golly oh just what i have always dreamed of dirty phone calls  how come
you told me what you could i guess i am through with your part of it
is there anything more i could 
i do not see anything do you
what are you gonna do next
try some other ways 
what do i do meanwhile  wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me
and i do not think that was tom
you said it was
hey but did we get to you klute a little
yeah you got to me
 us city folks the sin the glitter the wickedness
it is kind of late
oh do not be a doodoo
arlyn page
did she and jane mckenna know each other
frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his traveltime
that is the matter
what the hell do you think's the matter  i could wait for you someplace
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann 
 then you do not need me
just let me know when you are going out and where 
what if i go out on tricks  you wanna come along you could sit and read the national geographic
how can you do it to yourself
i do not get you
ligourin how could you do it
arlyn was a junkie i am not on junk
is that all you have to say
you and i  a relationship
i was wondering what that was
oh jesus oh jesus
oh look what he did in them
listen to me it is all right i have been expecting something
right back at the start right
go down in my room
ah schmendrick  that is the scam
those were police laboratory people they have been over the apartment
where would you spend last night
with trina
i called trina
maybe i was not there when you called
bree that is actually happened it was not that bad
how do you know how bad it was
why could not you stay here with me
hey  look officer  i can explain everything it was just  you know everything all of a 
please i said i do not want you to do this
well suppose i had not come downstairs would you just have folded up and sneaked away
no i was going to come up i wanted to ask you to marry me 
you wanted to or you are
i am
look  yes i mean thanks but  do not you think we better be realistic
how can you not think so you know the things i can do
you do not believe that either do you why cannot you see my side
can i carry something for you to the car  will you kiss me
she would not be reliable anyhow  a narcotics addict
all right suppose it was not tom grunemann where does that get you
it is where it does not get me i have got nothing left that connects to anything
then close the case
i better keep looking
where how
i could try arlyn page again she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer not tom you said the dumper was clearly not tom
i am flying back out to pennsylvania friday i will fill them in on things
sorry we had to meet here but i am pressed for time
i am on my way to chicago very important meeting tonight well  any new developments
yeah two things pete that 
you said trask was arranging laboratory work police laboratory anything from that
yeah it was not tom
i am sorry i do not understand
it was not tom that broke in the room
some mistake perhaps that 
no no mistake pete it does not prove who it was  but proves it was not tom
you must be discouraged
not too bad this brings back that dumper in the picture
that who
dumper the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew
you said he was no possible connection with tom the page girl told you that not tom
someone's been doing all these things
you were hired to look for tom not someone
i cannot follow you
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckenna's list of clients
i can talk it over possibly i can get the money when are you meeting the man
tomorrow evening nine east river drive and 73rd street
suppose i meet you there a half hour before
just send me a money order
john how are you
i will be sending you on a report tonight
it is a beautiful day in tuscarora  i do not envy you that humidity in the city
would you like to know that is in it the report
i am sure the fbi and the police explored that possibility
no they never did really but that is what i am going to recommend the next step unless something 
have you discussed this with them
it is in the report
do they have the report have you discussed it with them
all right
thank you goodbye john
i have always respected bree  i would like to make something clear
two years ago sorry
they tell me you use narcotics could i bring someone around to look at your arms
ok a family matter between the girls i had two other cows    two other girls besides bree
i would like to talk with jane mckenna
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it
not unusual
klute with a k k  l  u 
are you with plant security sergeant
town police
then how are you involved
i know tom grunemann
you knew the subject thomas grunemann how well
we grew up together kids
marital problems in general indicates possibly  am i right sergeant
everybody's got some i guess
that is a lot of people to die unknown
he is right you know waiting for the pusher she would tell you anything
that is how the other one died you know in the water
think this is our guy
i do not know it looks familiar to me
but what reason could he have what possible reason
unless he was involved with grunemanngs disappearance
i knew tom never wrote that letter
gov want to leave me that one how come he got to play with this one anyway
it is damn lucky you did not have the dossier on cable here
are you closing the case

now then mrs kramer would you tell the court how long you were married

no i did not
tell me mrs kramer are you employed at the present time
yes i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer
and what is your present salary
mrs kramer do you love your child
yes  very much
objection your honor  the answer is to be generous very vague
no further questions  thank you mrs phillips
objection your honor  counsel is harassing the witness
objection  your honor counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings

ted i just heard
ted what are you talking about
do not play innocent with me thelma  you know perfectly well that is going on
ted i do not understand a word you are saying  where is joanna
we must go holiness
please come holiness
all quiet
yes holiness
where are you from
kham holiness
your people are very brave they are fighting the chinese no one can stop them not even me
i worry about them
you were a beautiful baby so calm
and that day your father got better he named you lhamo the protector
i am sorry lhamo
not the way to talk to people
but i am in charge
i do now
and you have horses you love horses
i do beautiful horses thank you holiness
will you buy the sheep for me
where will you keep them
here we will collect them
i will buy them for you
we are simply respecting the terms of the seventeen point agreement
are you general
the people's liberation army pays for all food and lodging
how much tea do you drink prime minister
why is it necessary for the chinese to keep so many soldiers in lhasa
to protect to serve you chairman mao wants you to feel that china belongs to you now
plans for absorbing the tibetan army into the people's army will soon be finalized
i will not approve it
then we will begin with replacing the tibetan flag with the flag of the motherland
dalai lama
general chiang
we bring greetings from chairman mao
have you heard the terms of the seventeen point agreement
i have
he has been imprisoned here in the potala holiness
the sera monks have surrendered
did you receive the letter
and the united nations surely
with much bloodshed
i am afraid
i want at all costs to avoid this do we have news from the delegation in china
not yet but the governor of chamdo ngabo jigme suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to peking
ngabo did not have the state seal he could not sign
general chiang chinwu the chinese representative is en route to dromo he is coming to meet you
oh no where will he go
your father had been very sick
i miss my brother
i will be back in a few days
this many
who am i
i accept it what is suffering
true suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions birth illness grief old age poverty pain death  these are surferings
can i save the sheep from going to the market so they do not die
you could buy them
do i have money
what do you think
you cannot do anything real until you are dalai lama
i am him
how big is tibet's army
roughly five thousand men
is that big
no not very big
will we be in this war
no this war is almost over
in the pacific ocean
it is an island american territory
where is alsace
what was the warning of the thirteenth dalai lama
he warned about the future of tibet
tell me
i am sorry for you to have to witness this kundun
i need to know what you know i am no longer a child
ask whatever you will
the war is over this is a time in when nations are redefining themselves
so tibet too needs to define itself
yes as a free country but our attempts have proven futile we continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the chinese
can india help us
britain chooses not to
and america
america we shall see
quite simple yes good
one country did sponsor the resolution a land called el salvador
where is that
it is unlikely america perhaps there is great anticommunist feeling in america
at this point the most likely result of a foreign pact is war
i am scared
did you ever doubt it
land reform is underway in amdo the large estates are being confiscated and redistributed landlords are being punished
the pursuit of nonviolence very difficult
they will take lhasa next
i will not go
good day
good day
please come in so cold
we are traveling to lhasa may we
of course please this way your servant may use the kitchen
you must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the tibetans trust and good nature
for me i think such a mix is crucial
ah dalai lama thank you for coming so late
i leave tomorrow
well some say it is not for you to worry about another will be chosen
i turn you over again today lhamo one day you will not be able to come running to us
you will always
do you think i must
does he have the spot
he does a little spot where the butter had been
is that a true story or pretend
what does the butter spot feel like
i have more men
things change kundun
is that true or pretend
i want to go down there
you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony
i want to run down the street i want to buy a toy eat from the shops
you cannot
i want to be a shepherd taking those goats and cows out to the hillside
but you are not a shepherd you are the dalai lama
maybe in the next life the world will not need a dalai lama
we have enemies
the people want you made dalai lama
then i am lucky i am still too young
these are dangerous times they want the dalai lama to lead them
but i have no experience
you will not come
no holiness
am i running away
you must study very hard do not neglect the holy things during this time
i will miss you
we have had fun you and i fun for a little boy in an old palace
we have
you have grown up very good
you kill me
do not eat all those sweets you will get sick
do you remember the day i came to your monastery when i was a baby and you comforted me
i do
we cannot
this is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth this is a fight for tibet
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy we have compassion for all people
you are in great danger the dalai lama cannot fall into chinese hands you must flee
how could i ever leave
taktra rinpoche i understand there was an attempt on your life
it is possible holiness
what should i do about my doubt teacher
it is a difficult situation
i mean my doubt why me am i him
the land has stayed in the family we work together the nobleman is not too bad
too young
like my mother

you cannot take a cow by eminent domain
we will not let him get hurt ma'am
oh my husband passed away almost two years ago
my department does not have any record of that mrs bickerman
ma'am  your husband bernie  you did not by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded
ma'am how could you not report this  he puts human life at risk and
you are to wait right here until the police show you are under full house arrest
i will sue you

mr krendler dr lecter trusts me or at least he used to if i could just 
do you need a police escort starling or do you think you can find the airport by yourself

good morning mr crawford
your instructors tell me you are doing well top quarter of the class
who's the subject
yes well okay right i am glad for the chance sir but  why me
now i want your full attention starling are you listening to me
i have read your interim memo on lecter you sure you have left nothing out
it is all there sir practically verbatim
every word starling every gesture
right down to the kleenex i used  sir why is something wrong
do you recall my instructions to you starling what were they
to complete and file my report by 0800 wednesday but sir 
then do that starling do just exactly that
sir what is it there's something you are not telling me
miggs has been murdered
why not
he is got a real taste for it now and he is getting better at his work
maybe you have got a knack for this i guess we are about to find out
okay starling let's have it
you have not said a word today about that garage or what i found there
are you finished
i do not know i did not see those on any of the other girls
but for catherine martin it all comes down to you and lecter you are the one he talks to
i think he means it this time i think he will deal
what would it take
mr crawford can those cops down there handle dr lecter
you heard them i do not have that authority anymore
ohio is cold ground picked over ten months ago our people worked it so did the locals
but not from this angle not thinking he knew her you have got to send me
i am bureau for 28 years starling i will not disobey orders not even now
but i just became a private citizen i can go anywhere i want to
what do you do when you are not detecting officer starling
i try to be a student dr pilcher
ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer the amusing house wine
and there's no way  no natural way  these could have wound up in the bodies
they live in malaysia in this country they would have to be specially raised from imported eggs
where does mrs lippman live i would like to talk to her
is that a pretty good job fbi agent
i think so
you get to travel around and stuff i mean better places then this
doctor we have a hard problem in psychological profiling i want to ask for your help with a questionnaire
we being the behavioral science unit at quantico you are one of jack crawford's i expect
i am yes
that expires in one week you are not real fbi are you
i am  still in training at the academy
jack crawford sent a trainee to me
we are talking about psychology doctor not the bureau can you decide for yourself whether or not i am qualified
it is much better than your shoes
maybe they will catch up
i have no doubt of it
did you do those drawings doctor
yes that is the duomo seen from the belvedere do you know florence
all that detail just from memory
no i came because we need 
how many women has he used our bill
five so far
all flayed
partially yes but doctor that is an active case i am not involved if 
witless and misleading why do you think he takes their skins officer starling thrill me with your wisdom
it excites him most serial killers keep some sort of trophies
i did not
oh officer starling do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool
you are a tough one are not you
i would not have had that happen to you discourtesy is  unspeakably ugly to me
then please  do this test for me
no but i will make you happy i will give you a chance for what you love most clarice starling
your bleeding has stopped
how did   it is nothing a scratch
why do not you ask me about buffalo bill
why do you know something about him
if you did not kill him then who did
who can say best thing for him really his therapy was going nowhere
scared at first then  exhilarated
ahhh why
i do not know next time i will have to check
jack crawford is helping your career is not he apparently he likes you and you like him too
who killed your patient
oh a very naughty boy someone you and jack crawford are most anxious to meet
big through the hips roomy
they all were
was it a butterfly
a moth how did you predict that
plum island animal disease research center sounds charming
go doctor
that is your worst memory of childhood  quicker than that i am not interested in your worst invention
the death of my father
you are very frank clarice i think  it would be quite something to know you in private life
dr lecter there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence transsexuals are very passive
clever girl you are so close to the way you are going to catch him  do you realize that
i went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in montana they had a ranch
a cattle ranch
horses  and sheep
how long did you live there
two months
why so briefly
i  ran away
did he try to
on what basis would they reject him
the personality inventories would trip him up rorschach wechsler housetreeperson he would not test like a real transsexual
clarice you are hardly in a position to accuse me of lying
he kills w
what is the first and principal thing he does what need does he serve by killing
dr lecter when there's time i will 
we do not reckon time the same way clarice this is all the time you will ever have
not just clarice what set you off you started what time
early still dark
i heard a strange sound
what did you do
they were slaughtering the spring lambs
yes they were screaming
but you could you did
yes i do not know i do not know
thank you clarice
tell me his name dr lecter
brave clarice will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming
yes i will tell you
you know i cannot make that promise
examination and interview materials are confidential we have never violated an applicant's trust and we never will
it may be that  i could confer with my colleagues on this and get back to you
thank you doctor i will keep it in mind
time pilch my move
of course it counts how do you play
my god you have grown up
we leave in the morning
are you alright
the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake build fires and provide every comfort you desire alice
though they are strangers they are at least entitled to a christian burial
why did not you bury those people
anyone looking to pick up our trail would see it as a sign of our passing
you were acting for our benefit and i apologize i misunderstood you
well that is to be expected my father
your father
chingachgook he warned me about people like you
he did
the ottawa are gone
we are a breed apart and we make no sense
in your particular case miss i would make some allowance
i am sorry
i do not remember them i was one or two
sorry to disappoint you
much further
mr poe
what are you looking at mr poe
they are going to hang you  why did not you leave when you had the chance
because what i am interested in is right here
no i will find you
what is it
will you go back to england
told you to stay away from this hell hole  why did you disobey me
when how
my letter
there was no letter
i am embarrassed to be so indecisive after so long apart and after you have traveled so far
and by sea
you still have an aversion to the water
will you consider that
my god alice
one called magua arrived
i see
beyond the periphery of men staring at him
yes go ahead
 compliments mr poe  take her and get out
your wounded should try walking back to albany  they will never make a passage north
we were headed
how far is it scout

colonel munro sent him he was one of our mohawk allies
dark haired
miss cora munro he never set eyes on her before today
no blood vengeance no reproach or insult
of course not  and how is it you were nearby
came across the war party tracked 'em
fort edward then
no heading west to cantuckee
i ai not your scout and i am in no damn militia
i owe you gratitude or i would call you out

that is sedition treason
that is the truth
i ought to have you whipped from this fort
how long
head for for the white water
where do we go from here
we do not
then what
then we take the south rim down the mountain and it is 12 miles cross country to fort edward
and if we are unlucky
any powder
it should be enough to remind you france is the enemy
what did you say
i said france is your enemy not ours
will you men help us stop the french
you do what you want with your own scalp  do not be telling us what to do with ours
you sir you call yourself a loyal subject
that we did john but the horicane  is near trapped out
folks here going to join in that fight
i will cover them from the top of the casement
got a reason to stay
help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores
a man here can make a run straight through to webb
yes mr poe so
many men here their homes are in the path
i will have none of that  montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman not a butcher
easy for you to suppose while it is their women and children not yours alone in their farms
i did not experience anything so surprising from bristol to albany as what i witnessed here today
and what is that
does webb not even know we are besieged
what a place for them
webb's not in albany he marched the 33rd to fort edward two days ago
webb's at edward
things were done nobody was spared

like in nothing  nobody  nix
who is he
i hear mrs swanngs quite a babe
you heard right
you ever been married
my life was too weird for her
i could have lost my fucking hands
that is butterfield
take a look at this
maybe they are not tricks
i mean there's no instructions  what do you mean they are not tricks
what did vinovich say something about walking a path between 
trickery and divinity  yeah he says that all the time
that is because he knew  he would seen these files and knew
hokey enough for you
thanks billy
how would you spell that again
you did  did not you
why would i do that
you do not have a clue what you are into do you
who did this
who did this
d'amour d'amour why do i know that name
i saw him on tv  some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life
he is a priest
i do not want him getting in the way
we have all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled
what about death
i could scoop them out
do not
so tell me where nix is buried
i will tell you
if you have lied to me to me 
oh christ  oh christ
jesus  valentin  what did you do to your face
like the look of these  i made them myself to set him free
why did you wait so long
i did not have the skill to resurrect him  i had to teach myself  and that took time
and you think he will be in a fit state to resurrect after thirteen years
if he was just a man like me then no  but he is not
what is he
he is with us
please butterfield i was not there  ask pimm
please i was not there ask pimm
you do not
that is the connection
i do not exactly know philip does not like to talk about the past
he is a secretive man
and you do not ask questions
we do not share our lives the way a lot of people do
does that mean
we have not slept in the same bed for years
but obviously you still care what happens to him
you do not believe me
when do you want me to start
come to the show with me tonight i want you to see him with an audience  they love him
he is good
are they treating you okay
i do not know where you would start
well how about some of the other illusionists
they will not tell you anything
i can be very persuasive
how did it go today
they were jealous of him
why  because he had you
he did not have me  i told you
so why did you marry him
that is my business harry
just curious  back to business  ever heard of a man called nix  dorothea
yes i am here  and no  i do not know the name
what about jennifer desiderio
it does not ring a bell  i have to go
okay  i will keep digging
what did you find
oh christ
nix ran some kind of cult right some kind of charlie manson deal
it was more than that i think
he was the real thing right
he could get into people's heads make them see things terrible things  and he could levitate juggle fire
he taught all this to swann
i told you 
you said you were not with him for love
i was not
it is okay
no it is not  you cannot help me
i was so afraid
do not be  nix cannot hurt you now
are you sure
i am sure  he is dead
i was twelve  nix took me hostage to get swann to come to him
quaid and jennifer
what was that
are you all right
oh god
i have got to help him
you cannot
 oh god
do not look
is it finished
good  there  yes
crank call  i will get the number changed
it is better he is gone  he would have done more harm than good
harm to whom  me  i do not think so  try him again at the hotel
what about me
bad show last night
the usual  full house standing ovation  i tell them it is magic
 they believe you
somebody killed him
oh god
i am putting in a new illusion tonight  will you be there
sure  you want me to find out about quaid  i mean the funeral
tapert  so now i have got tapert butterfield
tapert's got nothing to do with this  he came here to get his palm read
where the fuck is he
he got up and walked
are you finished with me
for now  are you planning to go back to new york
you believe that
i think we walk a narrow path between between
trickery and divinity
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real
no  i am saying they were always fake  the saints the messiahs they were just illusionists
so could you walk on water
i could reproduce any miracle that is ever been performed with a little preparation
they were not worth a damn
i heard he was the best
you tell me  no  i thought you would maybe have a theory
oh i have got plenty
i am not saying another word  you damn fool  he is a journalist
just tell me about swann  or are you too scared
with what
great accent by the way  is it brooklyn
mr d'amour
go away
it is one in the afternoon
what are you my mother
whatever i said i did not mean it okay  i get a few drinks inside me 
we have never met
then what do you want
i am here to offer you a job
i am going back to new york in  shit  i am outta here
nah  you are driving it too carefully
maybe i just bought it
havanas  you are not the smoker  so who is
you could almost pass for a detective d'amour  i work for the best illusionist in the world
philip swann
you know of him
i saw him in vegas once
are you a gambling man
when i can afford to lose swanngs quite a magician
never call him that  he is strictly an illusionist
that is the difference
it is not a bad place  warm great view
i do not think the dead much care
are you sure
who is she
what the fuck are you doing here
looking for you  i tried the hotel
what for
left alone  somebody's been murdered
yes  it is regrettable
fuck regrettable  i want to know why
what for  you need to stay busy
i like to know why things happen
i want to speak to dorothea
i am afraid she is not in
i cannot let you in
yeah i know
leave her alone 
and then because i was getting too close to something   or someone you called swann
i tried to pay you off
nix is dead and buried for fuck's sake
i want to see swann face to face
him too
we have got to get you to a hospital
do not bother
shut up  we have lost enough lives already
i am sorry d'amour
what about
jennifer's only ever had one visitor
that is her problem
she has no real grip on reality
does anybody
oh yes  we have to agree that is real and that is not that is what holds us together
you need an ambulance
you have taken some strange journeys in your life
hold on
i am not afraid to die  there's something terrible coming home
at birth  i do not know you 
harry d'amour
i know all the kids coming up got to stay ahead of the game but i do not know you
i am in from new york  i came to see swann
what a tragedy  it was just a matter of time of course but it is not good for the business
was he taking a lot of risks
you do not know the half of it i am walter wilder by the way
you know vinovich
sure  vivovich
he knew swann way back  he says there were a lot of drugs a lot of crazy shit
i would love to you know hang with some of you guys
people are pretty cagey  who do you know
for what
for an introduction
are they all in the business
that is what they call the repository  every magic secret known to mangs locked up in that room
a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you are still alive
look ma no wires
you should not have followed me d'amour
how the fuck do you do that
now i am going to have to kill you
i do not think so  you need me alive
illusionists get las vegas contracts d'amour  magicians get burned
or murdered like nix
i did it for dorothea
oh yeah
so nix will not come looking for her
it is me betrayed him
and she shot him i  i think that would piss me off if i were nix
i do not know what else to do
oh jeez
you think i am an asshole
and he did not have them
he had something  he showed me how to bend the rules  a little levitation  a few fireworks
they got here before us
he is better off this way
nobody's better off this wav
that is where we are all going
jesus what the hell's going on in there
this is where we killed him
you did not try hard enough
can you do it
the case is closed harry tapert's given us a full confession  get your ass back to mew york
no  i am taking a couple of weeks' vacation
you never took a fucking vacation in your life harry that is going on
i got to go  i am late
call me tomorrow
there's other guys as good as me loomis
yeah  but not as cheap  call me
a couple of weeks
maybe i do not
what about philip swann
he is not  he is not
nix nix
is he the puritan
yes yes
and he is dead
i have got so much power to give you swann  all you have to do isbeg
fuck you
do not touch me  he is got got into my head
swann  what are you doing
you could still help me do that
why would i want to
because you have got nothing else to live for
not true
i missed you
how would your interview go  i am sure you charmed the hell out of sally
it is great of you to let william and susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet
you never said anything to me
weird  the book again  sex spelled backwards
did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings
says she can get me in to see this killer
oh peter you are going to pursue this
hey what are you doing here in the middle of the day
forgot my car keys  what are you doing on the fourth floor
i spaced out
what  that is horrible
yeah i appreciate it  thanks josef
i am still shaking
i cannot believe will killed him
i am gonna have to get a restraining order  what a nightmare
yeah like
like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic
it is with me all the time claire i just do not like to talk about it
well it shattered your faith in everything
i am just temporarily off my game
you need to believe in something besides yourself
what are these
i do not know  what are they
i found them in your file box
must be a spare set
honey you are exhausted  do you want to lie down for a little while
she is been stalking you peter
listen to me i love you peter i am trying to protect you
you really had me going claire  i was finally ready to propose to you
what ajerk
nonsense it is all of our home  so how is work treating you
frustrating  form over content everything's so retro
you wearing a watch father
you know i made a reservation at marco's for peter's birthday dinner but maybe you should cater it
what time did you make it for
and how would you describe him
quiet  real quiet
and on the day of the murders his state of mind
seemedon edge
tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and mr viznick
george come in  what the hell happened to you
it is nothing
sure it is  if the guards did this we can file charges
not the guards  some of the prisoners are easily disturbed
i can take care of myself
when your secretary called she made no mention of her coming too
my secretary
you are aware that this woman was party to the socalled exorcism
so you do not believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural
your court order dr allen
you know i am not comfortable with this
but your patient is legally entitled to it
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures
dr allen could you please tell mr kelson what you heard as you tried to enter mr birdsongs room
i certainly hope you are not lending any credence to this
the patient was in great distress naturally he wasyelling
and was he in distress when you opened the door  or was he sitting here relaxed at this table
there is a medical explanation for everything that happened
you were not there  give me time to get some proof
please maya  i am trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense
if you really believe in god why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real
the doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia
he will  he has great faith
is he going to be okay
father i have nowhere else to stay
you will do it
how are you doing  looking lovely as always
what is it
something he said just before
he spoke to you
yeah  it did not make any sense
you fucking bastard
do not you get it  they had their 2000 years  now it is our turn
so all that bullshit about god and faith
it was perfect  the harder i pushed the more you pulled away
you raised me like a son
you are my son  do not you see the opportunity that lies before you
why are you doing this to me
 you would not last five minutes
the ark sank the sun set the ark sank again
father i am right here
father  thank god you are better  i really need your help  we have only got a few more hours
do not worryabout the transformation maya
sowe won
we won because christtriumphed over satan
um hm  that is right maya
so if christ won that means what does that mean father  that satan
so i guess satan lost  satan is the weak one
father please do not die
hi i would like to make an appointment for peter kelson
how many weeks are you honey
thirteen  the last time can you believe it  this is how he says goodbye
you need his bloodtype  like right away
well i know he is come here before
that is his name
peterpeter kelson
you just call
two negatives always make a positive
oh my god
may i help you
peter kelson
yes and you are
i saw you on television yesterday  you were brilliant
you said that malignant narcissism was not evil
not pure evil  that is correct
and also that
listen i am sorry but i am running late
that there is no such thing as evil with a capital e
not the most popular opinion but yes
a narcissist does not admit it  it is the extreme of selfdenial
and i also believe in god and the devil in fact i know they exist
well by saying that you are acknowledging the existence of a higher power  which to a narcissist is impossible
in the end the jury saw it my way
well then it all seems to be working out for you  listen ms
do you remember henry birdson  the math professor who won the salwen medal then went home and killed his family
that is that got to do with you
last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed  you realize how rarely they make that ruling
sowhat did you think of the tape
i think you gave me the wrong one
what do you mean
you are sure  there was nothing
so what would i miss
where do you get off pretending to be my secretary
i had to
and this is evil  the guy had an aneurysm and now he is in a coma
that is their explanation  you might not believe me
we need to talk
why did he try to kill me
why did not birdson just say so
if you are possessed you cannot reveal anything satan wants hidden  unless you trick him
trick him
the good outwitting the bad  it is like birdson had a split personality
yes i know
the only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at bedford
so what
do you know your parents' blood types
when townsend tried to kill me he said something strange like  the time of transformation is near
what are you looking for exactly
we needed to know all we could
nothing yet
get up
you okay
it will happen at the exact time of your birth
he could not stop us and that is how he was punished  peter what time were you born
there's nothing else here
are you alright
sometimes when i feel weak i have thesevisions
i am scared i am slipping back
we are going to do this
you have to say that
why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths
no oxygen to the brain
maybe that is my problem
why did not you just go along with townsend  get rid of me  i would have
until it happens you are still a human being
what about after
plenty of time
what are these
i do not know  extra apartment keys that is it matter
what can i do
what did he say to you in french
he was trying to tell me something
how much time do we have
oh peter
good seeing you again
i know who he is
maya  what do you mean
and what are you thinking we should do now
i have filed a report with father frank
a lot of good that will do
we need all the help we can get
i have dealt with these people before maya  they are not going to help us
we will see father frank in the morning there's nothing to be done until then
it is uselesslook at him
you do not want to face it
look john i am facing it
i would appreciate it if you would put that back
but she worships you  your mother's dead but your father's alive
nothing you could not find out from reading the papers  and you are already wrong on one count
you know what  you can go
mr kelson here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism
what about that psychic that is his name szabo
he can see you thursday
i think it is gonna be a waste of time
the police used him as a witness in this case
i will be at bedford tonight if you need me
i plan to  you want a tip
lemme guess  the lottery
sometimes i can just feel the numbers
good of you to stop by
you are referring to the defense's efforts to prove that george viznick is tormented by demonic voices
there were not any voices
what do you mean by that
well we all have a degree of narcissism sally but a malignant narcissist is dangerously selfobsessed
would you sign it for me
hey  mr big shot
mike  oh the christening  i meant to call
so viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem
really  you know seeing these guys away from the court the facade slips you catch things
that is this
that is the matter with you
he could see me
thanks again for everything
that is up
how are you doing today
it is another day  i think i am alright
she came to me with a wild story about demonic possession
she is got a juvenile record from new orleans  parents died when she was 13
parents died
yeah murdersuicide
what happened
mother killed the father then killed herself  crime of passion
where is she now
ah mom
i hate it
i do not know why i keep hoping you will grow out of this tomboy thing
that is not funny
well that is what you think is not it cause i would rather wear a jersey than an apron
taste this
i cannot eat before a game
you really should be a caterer or something like you used to say
monica  what are you doing here
did not know i needed a reason to come home
do not be defensive  i am just surprised to see you
dad around
need any help
yeah  cannot wait to see him  i just saw quincy
to that stewardess
yeah you met her
his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago he could do a lot better if you ask me
so what do i do
you did not want my opinion in the first place so why even ask
i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy
do not curse
so that is why we cannot get along because i would rather shoot a dumb jump shot
you are the one always turning your nose up at me
no i do not
what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you
because you are pushing me to be something i am not
i am angry because i want a mother not martha stewart
oh yes  the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife
that is not it
i do not remember that
i do  you never stood up for yourself ever  if i was ashamed it was because of that
what are you talking about
she needs to stop running around like a little boy
she is alright
how is she alright looking the way she does
which one for tomorrow
the blue
when you are done can you make sure she brushes her teeth
are you okay
and if you want a thicker base you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour
so that means it is alright for you to act like that
so you are still breastfeeding
you might want to put a jacket on him it is getting cold
well thanks again  this was really nice of you
oh me too  i used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in atlanta
you know girl long as i have lived next door i have never seen the inside of this house
i can take it
i thought sidra's ankle was okay for next game
can i take your coat
no i mean i can check it for you
i am an english major  you like english
my mouth is kinda dry
quincy word has it you might make the jump the nba
do not go starting rumors jim  my songs college bound with or without basketball
you could make a career by telling me where
gotta wait til the press conference
but you would love for him to play at usc like you did
i am so sorry  no one would switch flights with me
it is okay
kyra this is monica  she uh
it means a lot that you came by
i do not wanna see that
so how long is this trip
why not
you might be the only one with a job
baby do not talk like that  your rehab's going well  you will be back before you know it
sometimes i wonder if it is worth it busting my ass for what
to do what you love
mom's going to hate it
always on my ass anyway
like you do not give her a hard time
you need to  she is alone in this house all day taking care of dad and your ungrateful behind

no  it was not like that
where am i going
do not you guys ever knock
where is he
oh yeah  you are a smart man
what about him
i need to ask you questions of a psychological nature
remember when you asked for a study on him i refused same goes for now
that was peterson upstairs
it was you who did the asking
he does not think you run mind games on him
that is the bottom line
if he pushes too deep into our boy's mindset he may destroy himself  what are you planning jack
could he handle a direct contact
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out
it has to be a book the tooth fairy would know lecktor has in his cell
how long do i have
that could be the tip of a 't  here and here and here
the chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the tattler right now
willingham when he tossed his cell took polaroids so they could get everything back in place
this is chester here who am i talking to
will graham jack crawford
we got an ad order in tonight's tattler with 'sixsixsix' in it it is being telexed to you right now
read it
 wouldear pilgrim you honor me'
that is it lecktor called him a pilgrim when he was talking to me
whatever i say you will take him away will not you
i have to
you are his friend jack why cannot you leave him alone
because it is his bad luck to be special
he thinks you want him to look at evidence
nobody's better with evidence but he has the other thing too he does not like that part of it
talking about 'like' you do not like me very much do you
no  i do not like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'
let's go to bed i will rub your back
how much do you know
what was in the 'miami herald' and the 'times'  confessions

you said the guy down here is good
he is good bur not as good as price
i do not know jack he is got no face for me
you can tell something about him or we would not have found the finger print
do not expect too much from me jack all right  we will get him one way or the other
he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time
because he has a genuine taste for it jack
see you do know something about him
for christ's sake why
is it weird
the mark yes
if the documents section cannot do it i will send it up to langley
how would you know 'broken mirrors' bribe a cop  tell it to the us attorney lounds
there's three 't's' and an 'r' in tattler
can we still get lecktor's message out of the paper

get me a plane

let's get straight who we have talking about  are you the man i am interested in
i do not think i will tell you
he is righthanded
most people are
he is misunderstood
he is very strong physically
that is true
our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time they dusted everything
the report did not mention nails and eyes
why do you think he took his gloves off
he may have a history of biting  barroom fights or child abuse
nine that we know of two did not die
what happened to them
one's on the respirator at a hospital in baltimore the other is in a private mental hospital in denver
what did the psychologists say was wrong with lecktor
psychologists call him a sociopath they do not know what else to call him
to yourself
i call him a monster
i understand he cut you pretty good
he stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here
what did he want
he asked how you are
and you said
i said you are fine he should leave you the hell alone

who is it
you are two hours late
you got the money
hallelujah  you are my savior man my own personal jesus christ
if you get caught using that 
something wrong man  you look a little whiter than usual
you ever have the feeling that you are not sure if you are awake or still dreaming
you were not supposed to relieve me
do not be ridiculous
we are going to kill him  do you understand that  he is going to die just like the others
do you
i it does not matter what i believe
you do not do you
if you have something to say i suggest you say it to morpheus
did you hear that
are you sure this line is clean
there's something about him is not there
hello trinity
cypher  where is tank
he had an accident
you are a beautiful woman  too bad things had to work out like this
i do not believe it  i do not believe it
no it is all right
what are you doing
is that
you bet your ass  it keeps him going  maybe it keeps all of us going
how many were there
five  since i have been here
what happened to them
thanks for the drink
i got you
just get me outta here
i know  they cut the hardline this line is not a viable exit
i got a fibrillation
we found him trinity  we finally found him
give me your phone
they will be able to track it
what is he doing
how long
you cannot use that until neo is out
who's coming for me
stand up and see for yourself
right now
what the fuck do they want with me
the cubicle across from you is empty
but what if
good  now there is a window  open it
no  it is too far away
this line is tapped so i must be brief
welcome neo  as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus
it is an honor
i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling down the rabbit hole
why not
because i do not like the idea that i am not in control of my life
the matrix
have you ever had a dream neo that you were so sure was real
this cannot be
 am i dead
what are you doing
why do my eyes hurt
morpheus that is happened to me what is this place
right now we are inside a computer program
no  i do not believe it  it is not possible
get some rest  you are going to need it
for what
this is incredible  i know kung fu
how did i beat you
you  you are too fast
do you know why you did not make it
i thought it was not real
if you are killed in the matrix you die here
do you understand neo
i think i do
what  are you trying to tell me that i can dodge bullets
set down in there
so is this the same oracle that made the uh prophecy
yes  she is very old  she is been with us since the beginning
the beginning
of the resistance
and she knows what  everything
she would say she knows enough
what did she tell you
and you still believe i am the one
yes i do
no  no  morpheus  do not
how is he
got it
goddamn  it is good to hear your voice sir
we need an exit
got one ready sir  subway  state and balbo
tank charge the emp
i am going to make the call
i know  you are neo  be right with you
that vase
i said do not worry about it  i will get one of my kids to fix it
so  what do you think  you think you are the one
okay now i am supposed to say 'hmmm that is interesting but' then you say 
but what
but you already know what i am going to tell you
i am not the one
that is funny
morpheus  he almost had me convinced
i know  poor morpheus  without him we are lost  we will never find the one
hello neo
how do you know that name
i know a lot about you  i have been wanting to meet you for some time
who are you
my name is trinity
trinity  the trinity  the trinity that cracked the irs kansas city dbase
i just thought you were a guy
do you want to go somewhere and talk
how did you do that
right now all i can tell you is that you are in danger  i brought you here to warn you
of what
they are watching you neo
what the hell is this
it is necessary neo  for our protection
from what
what is this thing
get this thing out of me
emp  an electromagnetic pulse
what does that mean
that the matrix cannot tell you who you are
but an oracle can
that is different
is it
are you worried
what did she tell you
are you all right
what did you just say
nothing  just had a little deja vu
what happened  what did you see
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it
how much like it  was it the same cat
what is it
we cannot leave him
is morpheus alive
what happened
goddamnit  goddamnit
that i would have to make a choice
what are you doing
i am going in after him
you cannot
i have to
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out  there's no way you are going back in
no you have to be
i am sorry i am not  i am just another guy  morpheus is the one that matters
what are you doing
i am coming with you
neo how did you do that
do what
you moved like they moved  i have never seen anyone move that fast
are you all right
can you fly that thing
if this war ended tomorrow zion is where the party would be
it is a city
the last human city  the only place we got left
where is it
holy shit
hey mikey he likes it  ready for more
see who
what are they doing to him
they inject viruslike serums to attack the neurosystems  it is like cracking a computer  all it takes is time
how much time
when it does morpheus will tell them anything they want to know
goddamnit  i do not believe this is happening
neo this has to be done
does it  i do not know  this cannot be just coincidence  it cannot be can it
what are you talking about
okay  store's open  what do you need  besides a miracle
it is locked
yes  they are moving him  i do not know where yet
we need an exit
you are not far from cypher
cypher i thought 
so did we  i sent him to franklin and erie
tank you are hurt
there is  we have to pull the plug
you are going to kill him  kill morpheus
what the hell just happened
an agent  you have to send me back

it is just a saying mr black
of whom

is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it
perhaps you could remind me
no i do not 
so tell me tell me i am peeing in my pants
i am not stepping anywhere 
i appreciate your gentlemanliness bill but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home 
'thoughts'  not a one  but i did hear a voice last night

in my sleep
'yes' to the deal

i have to go bill  it is been a helluva day  need a few minutes to sort everything out
what is there to say  they know what john bontecou is  and if they did not they know now
yes you made your feeling abun dantly clear  now they want to do the same with theirs
what are their feelings
if i read this board right now they want you to accept bontecou's offer
what do you think the board is going to say when i tell them that
i am feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me
i think it is time you went home drew
did you want to have a cup of coffee or something bill
that is it
bontecou wants a quick response and 
the answer is no quick enough for you
yes you are to understand that and now may i ask you a question

i think i would like to talk to my lawyer

you are what
i think you heard me bill
how perfect for you  to take whatever you want because it pleases you  it is not love

some aimless infatuation in which for the moment you feel like in dulging  it is missing everything that matters
those were my words bill
susan wants to come  she says she is in love with me
i do not like what you are saying

joe do not do this 
it is time to put this person where he belongs

mrs jankis the company's position is not that sammy is faking anything just that his condition cannot be shown 
i am not interested in the company position mr shelby i want to know your honest opinion about sammy
we should not even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal
i am not appealing the decision
i believe that sammy should be physically capable of making new memories
thank you
how can you read that again
it is good
you have read it a hundred times
i enjoy it
beg my forgiveness beg my wife's forgiveness before i blow your brains out

i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine and you could tell me what you think
how does a nice cup of cocoa sound

i always say if you cannot enjoy your own company you are not fit company for anyone else
thanks miz wilkes but i do not want to take up any more of your time i best be going

what are they
no it was not a miracle at all in a way i was following you
you want to read it
that is your new book called
i do not have a title yet
no what is it
oh it is ridiculous who am i to make a criticism to someone like you
i can take it go ahead
well it is brilliantly written but then everything you write is brilliant
pretty rough so far
the swearing paul  there i said it
the profanity bothers you
it has no nobility
oh i am sorry i did not mean to wake you
my daughter must be going nuts
it is like a visit from my oldest dearest friend
i made you my specialityscrambled eggs a la wilkes and i am on page 75
i guess that means it is okay
no no it is not it is  oh pooh i cannot think of any words would great be insulting
well you cannot believe everything you read in magazines
i knew it i knew it was not true boy how do they get away with printing stuff like that
thank you so much
yes i told you i was your number one fan
the sistine chapel
for a while i thought i might go crazy
yeah thanks
i do not want her spirit i want her and you murdered her
i did not
then who did
you are such a kidder i have a big surprise for you but first there's something you must do
you want me to burn my book
then light the match paul
no big deal
i do not know
see is not this nice
great i have always wanted to visit the other side of the room
and look what i have got for you an electric razor so you can shave yourself now
set what up
that is the big surprise your new studioafter all writers do need a place to work
misery's return
you just expect me to whip something off that it
i guess you do not get bothered by neighbors much
it is two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name annie
but mine cost the most so i do not see how it could smudge
no just the paper will be fine
are you sure 'cause if you want i will bring back the whole store for you
paul you are dripping with perspiration your color is very hecticwhat have you been doing
you know goddamn well what i have been doingi have been sitting here suffering i need my pills
poor dear let's get you back in bed and i will get them for you
i want my pills now
it will only take a second
here in case you think of any ideas
yeah well i would not expect too much
i am sorry paul this is all wrong you will have to do it over again
i really value your criticism but maybe you are being a little hasty here
paul what you have written just is not fair
he did not get out of the cockadoodie car
that is the matter paul you have not written a word
i cannot write this anymore
do not be silly of course you can
i am telling you i cannot
you canyou have the gotta
i have known from the very first book that misery had to be born of nobility and i was right
have to wait
will she still love him with that special perfect love
have to wait
whenever he played radio city who do you think was right there in the front row
to celebrate misery's return i could not have done it without you
i hope you like it
annie i think we should have a toast
a toast
to misery
wait let's do this right do you have any candles
did you study decorating or do you just have a flair
oh you i just picked things up over the years
well it certainly says you
you really think so
paul this is positively the best misery you have ever written
annie what is it
why would i want to leave i like it here
that is very kind of you but i will bet it is not altogether true
you have been out of your room
no i have not
paul my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south
do not talk to me like that
why what are you going to do  kill me take your best shot
why are you so mean mister you wouldbe deadinthesnowifitwas notfor me
oh no reason you keep me prisoner you make me burn my book you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles
i will drive a sledgehammer into your mangland if you are not nicer
be my guest
but the time is now soon others will come
oh paul it is beautiful
this is so exciting it is windthorne her first love right
i am glad you like it
paul this will be our legacy
what things
yes paul

you really think sheldongs out there
here's the list of all sheldongs credit charges nothing after the silver creek  any calls
they are hauling misery into court
that is nice
just leave it all right
oh i like that tone
how many times do i have to tell you i have a system here  where the hell is that thing
what thing
that thing  here it is right where it is supposed to be
what is it
i am not sure maybe nothing
it is good you found it
he is your client huh
people sure like those misery books
i am sure you know paul's been going to the silver creek lodge for years to finish his books
yeah i understand he is been up here the last six weeks
not quite i just called and they said he checked out five days ago is not that a little strange
you think he might be missing
i appreciate that thanks a lot
nothing unusual about mr sheldongs leaving busteryou can tell by the champagne
so do i
i will bet that old mustang's pulling into new york right now
answer me a couple things
if i can
do you have any of those new paul sheldon books
we had a batch sold 'em all in three days
you would not happen to remember if miz wilkes bought one would you
has she been buying any odd things lately
no the typing kind
you are still a writer
did they win
yeah they are in the semis
the word i am getting is the times review is gonna be a love letter
i thought you were over it
 pull the no2 tank and dump it it is potential evidence
all done chief
 right    do not go too far ahead of me now 
not everything  why do you think she is really here
from her point of view or mine
you are not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hairsplitting nuance are you
i thought you were going to dinner
hugh take care of the nekhorvich memory card
where is it
afraid he is got no choice  i believe i broke his jaw
not much luggage
i left in a bit of a hurry  i am terribly grateful sean
how grateful

on what
how hard you had to work to get me out of therehow in the world did you ever find me
how i usually find you nyah
you are not interested in seeing how it looks
i said you are beautiful nyah
you won
i suppose i did
what made you pick ithati nag  she would never won a bloody thing
'thief in the night'
see anything you like
to win
you picked another winner
then do not say it
i do not know what to do about you sean i am more than a bit muddled  i need time
to do what
sort it all out
and you are going to have time  there's been a change of plans
a change of plans
yes  we will not be able to have dinner tonight  something's come up  i hope you do not mind
oh no not at all  maybe just a bit
feel like pleading for your life

bellerophen  no time at all once i have got it
good  biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof
what are you talking about
fight a bit of a cold
and you are happy about that
beats fighting the flu i am here to tell you
there it is guys the last of it
yep  you have provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer
what was the top bid
why you going to make me a better offer
than thirtyseven million pounds  not really
oh hunt please one cannot hold nyah responsible for her actions
checkpoint charlie plus 30 altitude minus twozerothousand  airspeed oneseven niner knots
not exactly  wallis
more like twotwo point two million
 now here's the way it is going to workwallis the shares outstanding are
damn  just when it was about to get interesting
what you got there mate
well do you disagree with that
not at all  but how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site
ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar big bloke ginger hair they are into something
wrong  all we have got to worry about is ambrose  nyah will take care of nyah
it is billy
ambrose obviously got these from nekhorvich on the plane
so ambrose has bellerophon and mccloy's got chimera
package away in fivefourthree twoone
billy  i think we got a problem  nyah's on the wing  up early  billy do you copy
exactly where is she
we are due to take off
range is two kay
there she is  i got visual
that is it  that is it that is it
and the check's in the mall
i am booted up  go ethan
say again sounds like you are saying 'she is in the building'
she is in the elevator heading toward ethan
how much longer before you can reach him
what can we do' mate
do you know me
no  should i
no  you just looked as if you did
no  just as if i would like to
oh  well  i think that can be arranged
not tonight  bad timing  sorry 
what are you doing here
think you are the only one who can pick a lock
would you mind if i am on top
 rightwhere is it
where is the bloody 
 torque wrench
 this is very disconerting
i would not do that
you are apologizing for me  quite the gentleman
hi  would you mind slowing down
pull over and listen to me will you just listen
listen to what
i need your help and i thin you can use mine
your help  what are you talking about
scotland yard interpol every dutch authority  i can make them go away
that is you name
ethan hunt
awfully short notice
care to wait a decent interval
when they have got your recruiting technique  not a thing
oh  wellthis is not exactly by the book
they have got a book for this
which is
so where did i got right
you are not a liar  or you are an awfully good one  this thing these blokes pinched
well then what i am i doing here  i assume i am meant to be some sort of thiefto catchathief
spoken like a spookyou ever afraid
ask a question you get an answer
damn you are beautiful
that is the population of seville any idea
five sixhundred thousand
there's nearly 2 million in london
and six billion in the world
that is lot of people out therehow many of them i wonder are capable of something like that
not that it matter much buti seem to recall you staying something like 'i was hoping we could work together'
this was not what i had in mind nyah
go and insinuate yourself back into seangs life
i would like a little more conviction
so would i  but it is not mine to give
you have either got it or you do not  let your conscience be your guide
but i do not have a conscience  i am a bloody thief
i do not
someone in possession of all the facts  are you telling me i have to do this
generally i do not favor coercing someone not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands
and that is the only reason
what would not make him suspicious
this does not seem to be accomplishing much
well i mean it is not a total loss  it is keeping a very capable thief off the street
before you are
how can you possibly  i have got to get right on the plane  i am leaving now
you do not trust me
oh i do  but as we know i am a very poor judge of character
how is it going  everything okay
just like old times
just like old times
where do i meet you
betting table twelve off the paddock nyah are you up to this
i managed
i want iyou out of therei
nyah you have done more than enough  even the best of snake charmers get bit
i want you out of australia  i do not know how much more plainly i can put it
easy easy easy shhh
are you okay
i am now  get me out of here  just get me out of here
what did you think you were doing
 you who do not have a conscience
no  should i
sorry i did not let you know where i was
do not be  would not be on vacation if you did
well  you are sorry and i am sorry
why did you phrase it like that
like what
'you are sorry and i am sorry'
if he did not want to go anywhere without me how did you get him on the flight
so there's one thing we know ambrose does not
whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it
sean feels he has not done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground
right now only ambrose knows that
in any case you have got to recover chimera and bring it to us
 is where miss hall comes in
and then what
then makes sure she continues to see him gets him confide in her and report to you
i do not think i can get her to do it
yes i believe that is right
but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera
something else
are not you even curious  about why she did it
sorry ethan  i do not quite know where to begin  any suggestions
you would like me to conduct my own debriefing
why not  you have done just about everything else on this operation
yes i gathered as much
and that appears to have been destroyed it also contained the antivirus bellerophon
i do
where is she now by the way  do you know
i do not  no exactly
well hunt what are your plans
not sure  some sort of vacation  i will let you know where i am going
you keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it doctor
well yes  i suppose i am a bit anxious
they are ready and waiting  you will soon be with old friends
i am with an old friend now dmitri
he was quite a man  did he know before the end you two had succeeded
yes he knew  just
not in time to save him

ambrose got bellerophon from nekhorvich on the plane but he did not get the chimera virus
yeah  why else would he come back to australia  if he had them both he could sell them anywhere

er that is  that is enough music for a while lads it looks as though like there's dirty work afoot
brave sir rob 
he is brave sir robin brave sir robin who 
brave sir robin ran away
i did not
bravely ran away away
so there are rules  things you do and things you do not do
i was just telling the woman how i feel for god's sake
you do not tell her majesty how you feel
i speak as i find archie
so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting
how much
seventy a year
not bad not bad
it is better than shovelling horse shit
if you were looking for promotion you should have picked one of the healthier ones
she is hardly a full hamper herself
it is only grief makes her like she is
three years john  is that not a bit long to be grieving
she loved him
you know what i mean
i am not sure i do archie
which one of us is she flirting with
the goodlooking one
so  someone will send it on ahead
aye but will they
she is got an army of people to get her up and out
and she sent no word down
they said you were drunk  why do not you tell her the truth
what are you doing
i am getting dressed
you have got three broken ribs man
i have got my duties to attend to
do not be an idiot  you are in no fit state to go anywhere
she will be worried about me
she will get over it
oh i am much more than that
aye she may say that to you but the woman can say what she wants
you watch your tongue
come on man i am telling you what you already know
you know nothing about her
she will drop you  when she is done with you she will drop you
that is this
it is a diary
be careful who sees it
the place is a mess
i cannot move to tidy
it is what the maids are for
will not you give yourself a rest john she is other people to look out for her
that is your name
mary taylor sir
have i seen you up in balmoral mary
i hope to go up next year
checked and locked sir
louder girl
checked and locked sir
hey barney
mr brown sir 
yeah yeah i did
mr disraeli  ma'am
your royal highness  what a pleasure to see you here
have you met mr lyle  he is in sugar
no doubt you have heard the rumors
i take no account of gossip your highness
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy
it is the queengs decision
i wish to see my mother
she is busy
convey her a message
she is away to windsor tomorrow  talk to her there
tell her the prince of wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press
what did you say
i said are you deaf as well as stupid
do you know who you address sir
whom you address
well everyone's entitled to their opinion
i thought a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps
no dinners bertie  why are you dressed for outdoors
it is so infernally cold in here
surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop
it is a disgusting habit bertie  it should be discouraged
yes but is not midnight a little excessive
it is quite late enough
mr carter the head butler sits there
not now he does not  this is my place
by whose authority
checked and locked sir
how will i know
i am sorry
how will i know what she requires
you will be sent a message
who will bring it to me
her highness' equerry
i need a man who knows where i am
i am sure it will not be difficult to find you
then we will have to see what can be arranged
i came down at the queengs request i will take my orders from her
do you
awaiting my orders
you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it  you know that very well
i did not come all this way to sit on my arse
go inside at once
is that the queengs request
she will need to sign dispatches before she retires
that can wait till the weekend
there are important papers from 
if i find out that you had anything to do with this i will have you sacked
i believe that decision rests with her majesty
do not think i cannot persuade her
i do not doubt that the queen was highly amused  she has always had a very healthy sense of humor
nobody has any rights over me
what brings you here
what do you know about the highlands
i am a blank sheet
dare say you can be taught
to shoot perhaps but not to kill
you sent for me
forgive me i have called you out and you should have been resting
i am fine
you are injured
it is nothing
still someone must attend you  your wife should not have let you out
the look on their faces when one walks into the room  still gives one a ridiculous thrill
what i do i do for my queen
was there never ambition
maybe once
to have achieved one's ambition or to have reconciled oneself to its limits is a lifetime's work
i do what i do
but yourself  what about john brown
i said  i serve the queen
you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism
her mind is set  she will not change now
they do not see it
see what
the threat  i tell them but they do not see it
they are not as watchful as you
too busy looking after themselves
the greasy pole
no loyalty
i promised to protect her from people like you
for once in my life i am not the issue
she will never understand it
in time she will
she will think i betrayed her
you are here safely
aye ma'am
you are well
i am
and the pony
your family sent cards  it was much appreciated
i have no family ma'am apart from my brothers and sisters
yes  that will be company for you
mr brown
yes ma'am
you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so
yes ma'am
the queen will ride out if and when she chooses
prince albert was going to build a bench here  he thought it one of the best views in osborne
it is a fine spot ma'am
it is a fine spot for a bench is it not
i am thinking of publishing my highland journals
are they worth reading
i am told so
who by
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming
what does he know about the highlands
he has been attending at balmoral for many years
that does not make him an expert
his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject
i do not groom a horse to have it admired by others i groom it because it needs grooming
i do not do it for others  but ponsonby thinks they are good
just say what you have to say woman what other people think should not matter to you
they are ready now
i hope they did not go to any trouble john
we took a nip of whiskey
what is it john  john
must they always follow us
i ordered it  it is for your own safety
am i not safe enough with you john
aye  but there are fenians reported on the mainland
the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated i am sure
yes ma'am
i was told you were in a fight
yes ma'am
has someone seen to those bruises
duty  you talk about duty
if duty and safety are served by the same end then aye i do
i cannot believe you are saying this you who i have relied on all this time 
have i ever let you down before
 you stand there and tell me it is my duty  after all you promised me
i am breaking no promises
you are forcing me to do the very thing you know i fear most
for god's sake woman i am just trying to keep you safe
then why send me back to them
you should never have gone out in such foul weather
someone has to look after you  it could have been someone  it was before
forgive me gentlemen  i am late
not at all dean  good of you to spare the time
i came as quickly as i could
you have seen the latest cartoon in punch i take it
what can we do
then they may read about me
indeed and for that they are eternally grateful
is that not enough
i stay here because i am happy  is that such a terrible crime
should we take it seriously
the cartoon or her majesty's absenteeism
well both
the question is do we need her
surely you are not suggesting we dispense
i see the prince of wales is here
what did he want
we are going to lose
mrs brown
she is refusing to leave balmoral
a distinct flushing around the cheeks she was drunk i tell you
the queen wishes to publish an account of him
dear oh dear
quite  i think i would best take it back
where did you find it by the way
well no rest for the wicked henry
i am sorry ma'am
why am i being lectured in this way
forgive me your majesty  in no way did i wish to suggest
no  you are mistaken  prince albert my husband had typhoid fever  i asked what was wrong with my son
why was i not informed
i did not consider it wise in the circumstances to tax your nerves
the royal family and senior members of the household ma'am
just them
it is mr brown ma'am
what is he doing there
he appears to be  standing by his horse
i made no request to go out riding today  how long has he been there
i understand he was in a fight
has he been hurt
how long has he been this sick
a few days ma'am
sir henry mr brown is standing in the courtyard  i have no wish to go riding
i am very sorry ma'am  i cannot imagine  he was certainly given no instructions
please make sure it does not happen again
he thought perhaps your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government
we stayed a little longer than expected with mr and mrs grant  it was most agreeable
we were expecting you to return by six
who told them that
i have no idea
why not
there is one other matter
what is it
i have a letter ma'am
from whom
from princess helena and other members of your family
what do they want
where is my son
prince albert is at windsor ma'am
why is he not here
he is sick ma'am
then why are you not with him
you ordered all members of the royal family to attend you at balmoral
what is the matter with him

no problem that is on your mind
i agree with what you saidtruly
what did i say
that a mangs attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be

good morning what do you have today 
i will do the standard research and have them in by midnight pending any unforseen problems
that is going on 
where are we 
what about matt 
why do not you tell us what the fuck is going on 
why should i 
you said we were criminals what did you mean 
you are both embezzling i saw the records
embezzling  i am not embezzling 
maybe not but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory he stole your passwords
now where do we go 
how do we get out of this room 
now what the hell are we supposed to do 
there's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air it will not kill you but it will hurt
come on it works
so where does this lead 
no where we have got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall
so what do we do 
i am working on it
who the hell are you anyway  what is this place 
it is called murderland it is paid for by first bank
first bank  but how 
it is a tax write off for john c mccay
what are you doing 
if you had not started boffing that weasel with an attitude you would not be here
i am not boffing matthew 
then you did not give him any passwords of any kind 
no  i would not do that
then he is not embezzling either is he 
so you are telling me you were set up  i knew something was wrong
i am not listening
it will not take them that long to figure out we were not on the train when it wrecked
that is the trick here 
we drown
how long till the room fills 
so why this 
excuse me 
why did you build this whole place 
is this really the time 
do you have something better to talk about 
i just graduated from mit in engineering that is when john mccay hired me
but how do you know if the people are guilty 
i do a very thorough background check i go through police files personel files anything
there are other things too they had everyone start taking those psych tests did they make you take one 
i i 
you did not think about it did you  i read your file it said you had a nervous breakdown
i wanted to let his family know
know what  that it was your fault 
if we can get to through the next room we will be at a junction for a power grid
this is cute
yeah real cute the storm is fake but the lightening is real
okay mr inventor how do we avoid it 
where are we going 
i do not get it
what was that 
what about you 
just stop it end it here
what are you doing here 
i work here remember 
apparently pretty high we just got a new ceo last week
that is a shame
yeah a real shame

yes can i help you  maybe a donut or something 
that is very funny sir you are under arrest
kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets

hey try swimming it works
what the fuck are you talking about
this probably is not the bet time but i really have to pee can i pee 
is it over 
he is the liaison for mccay listen go go now
i did not think he would make it past scraps
do not eat at the console
never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes his file says he is an avid jogger
he will never get it right try the log ride 
not yet
but he is
stop the hydraulics
johnny let's get the cleanup started
hand me the 38ths
here am i ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers 
when i think you are ready
when will that be 
when you are ready
look you are going to have to start trusting me sometime i am a trustworthy person
trust is earned not given away
that is wrong 
he already had a balance of $600000
he probably has a history of this shit
yeah maybe let's start the background checks let's see where they live and what kind of security systems
matthew lives on the upper west side kinda posh for a temp do not you think 
any priors  any police record 
checking hah  he has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets
parking tickets  that is it 
yeah but we are talking 43
why do not you just stop fucking around and just die 
you think i am that easy bitch 
fire the whole division
yes sir i do last night's fresh from the park
i have to say that i am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass
thank you  sir sir may i ask you a question 
zach how old are you son 
i am thirty two
and how much do we pay you annually 
thank you sir i was really hoping for shares or possibly cash but this this is really personal
that was rather disappointing
i propose we consider a hostile take over perhaps ol' bruce is in need of a new job opportunity
what do you mean sir 
i will bet that would be the park run of the century 
sir he created the park he would know how to circumvent any of the traps
i am willing to bet that even the creator cannot out wit his creation
what then sir  what would we do with the park with out bruce 
do you think the assistant that is his name
john sir
yes do you think he would like a raise and a new position 
zach my boy  how is tonights adventure going 
is it as good as i hope it is 
yes sir it will be the best of your collection i assure you
fantastic  a little faster sweetheart
sir  we are moving them right along as fast as we can
he has a phone pole sticking in his chest i think we do not need an autopsy
hey mr executive buy you a drink sailor 
we have new guests for the park i have a file on them may i see bruce 
no i was just curious if what i heard about you is true 
i was
might i ask why you no longer work for the mob 
there was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs
i thought and correct me if i am wrong but were not you trying to play both sides 
what are you looking for  a blow job 
no i am not a homosexual
then what do you want 
have you ever considered running your own park  i mean since you will not be returning to your former profession
i did not think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new park
are you happy with your salary and position 
no i am not
i had hoped you would say that i have a proposal for you
so who are these people with the boss 
just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life
how long till the drug wears off 
we should have another fifteen minutes at least
what is bruce doing 
what was that 
he must have had a gun stashed god damn it 
we cannot afford too many surprises
will he make it out 
that is next 
i have a turn for the worse for the team 
i have got five bucks that says someone dies here and now
look he figured it out 
look  look 
shit i forgot about them well i guess the boss man was not as tough as i thought
i do not know maybe we should watch the tape to be sure
was that the old man 
there  there  did you see  they are still alive 
thank you very much
okay i have five that says this is it for them
what the  
what happened 
the power went out in half the park

you have no appropriate sense of emergency  my best friend is ruining his life
no he is ruining yours
same difference  if you love someone it is your duty to save them from themselves
you have a real philosophy of life
he is adored me for nine goddamn years
chill  we do not want your face coming off with it
chill  since when do you say ch
you flew all the way h
i noticed  i am on the noon back we have this thing with george's family in the hamptons

i was devastated
there are 18250 nights in the next 50 years
you have been working on this huh
this is my whole life's happiness i have to be ruthless
he was in love with me every day for nine years  i can make him happier than she can
it is not his happiness you are feeling guilty about
someday she will thank you

zit cream
try less appropriate
ben gay
elmer's glue
i give
how do you know you can touch that plug are you a licensed contractor
i suppose it is too late to start over
two words
you are going to say it are not you
tell him you love him  with all your heart
i am taking my next book to viking
tell him you have loved him for nine years but you were afraid to realize it
i am moving this book to viking
digger and george are with family in the hamptons until monday morning  brevity is even more in order than usual
i did what i came to do
i will think about it  i am okay
all i have heard from the day i met michael is julianne this and julianne that
well we are
my heart's in my throat here right off i have to ask this monstrous favor
excuse me
but i cannot be dry
can you watch the road
this is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav
you cannot believe what it would cost to bring in a temp
which was the disqualifying factor
i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress
what else did he tell you
that is why michael and i were the wrong fit  right from the start
do not you have to be somewh
 luckiest guy in the northern fucking hemisphere is all i am s
what because i am a little understand
i am excited sports illustrated gave him this kind of shot he is only there a ye
well  you have been introduced to the symphonic range of
he sucks soup through his front teeth
a trademark move do not touch it
but he sure can kiss
it is been awhile  i will take your word
and loving him means loving all of this
do you get nervous in small confined spaces
so it is sweet of you to be protective
let me rephrase that
but nothing ever could ever did give me a moment's pause about this marriage
do you get hysterical in small confined spa
you will always be there  in his mind  the perfect creature he loved for all those y
and the answer was so simple
i was gonna predict that
you are enshrined in his heart and memory  unassailable which works out great
i have missed a step
 always  the best dim sum the best camping stuff
stop we are embarrassing h
about michael's job
oh that  i forgot i even said th
i just think you are wrong is all
but he always says
for the twins what in the world is th
exactly what
he will see right through it
in six months he will be happy settled successful
uh kimmy
look at all this beautiful food so lovingly prepared
who  the jerk who's running your life
this must be very very hard on him
when are you gonna come clean with your folks
do not you see
if you are waiting for do you take this man that is considered poor form
yeah well lots of couples are imcompat
in one minute  you are going to feel so foolish
why do not you just drive a stake through my heart
i never want to go through this again
well  see  that was a reflex to see if it would
 look good on kimberly
i saw the show
wallace egregious residence mandy speaking
it is jules you guys have not had a call from say kimberly have you
if he gives you grief i will have him skillfully beaten where the wounds will not show
i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question
under the circumstances  charmed to know you jules
is anybody watching
it is a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson michael's boss
i think he is been fired
i thought michael was picking me up
i have not caused a problem have i
well you are a little early
i have been calling for days
well that is great  you have not really had anybody since dingbat jennylee
and she is all wrong for me
well somet

but they are so down to earth such wonderful people
well the sox are at home  si's letting me do a profile on the big hurt  that is frank
well maybe we should talk ab
best everything joe  but i am going to dance with you
luckily  the closer i watched the more the fault came into focus  each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability
such as
she is too genuine
hate that
how can you trust someone you can never mistrust
no matter how many times i leave the toilet seat up she forgets and puts it down
endearingly absentminded
every day  she makes the bed
quite the little eccentric
is there a coup de grace in here somewh
she admires  tommy lasorda
waiter check please
she finds him personable
gimme like eight and nine off the top ten list
the vespa me hanging on behind in the rain all night
should i whistle down a cab
pretty amazing girl you have got make that kind of sacrifice
i guess you are right  that would be deceitful manipulative controlling emascula
still  all's fair in love and w
you are not eating
i never eat when i am serene
you never eat when you are despondent
last zoo we were in was beijing yeah  sure  the rhinos were fucking
it is weird being the groom  all these things kimmy has to take care of
wow and wow  you have a date after this
no problem  a little bullshit about daddy's needs and presto i am a lap dog in high society
michael it sounds like a wonderful opportun
you guys are heartless my bride picked this out
big weddings are so strange
kim has all this stuff to do i hardly see her
you miss her huh
do not you throw up on boat
i have been thinking a lot the last couple days  about us actually
well  there's a lot of memories to choose from
you have sort of been y'know the woman in my life
and i was thinking this could be our last time  alone  together you know
except for the hot affairs we will have twice a year
i can hardly wait for your wedding
dance card filled
where did we first hear th
so we heard it like right that that first
no accents today
i am up against a deadline
me too  i am getting married tomorrow
i forgot how cute you look  when you get impossible
we could use his computer to just email those suckers right ou
listen up huh even if you blow this deal how big could it be
this thing means that much to y
the fax is from ben too  man it is my wedding and my boss cannot leave me alone
isabelle  i need to talk to kim
mike the funny thing is he is offering you a gig you would be stupid to turn down
i am just tired  please put her on  thanks
what happened
she denied it  said i was crazy and paranoid
no it is for the best it really is  we were so wrong for each other
should we take a walk  or maybe some food sent up or something
or we will go somewhere  if you have the time
i had the craziest dream last night  walter and kimmy had asked your boss to
look i came down here to face everybody  i did not want to slink away like some coward
but the scotch salmon was so fucking good you decided to stay for brunch
she has not told anybody what am i supposed to do
this is her family and her fault
and your point
well  how come she did not
i asked you
does that make it right
thank god you were here
oh yeah
i was so confused so conflicted so unstable
 your one chance for true happiness
 yeah that
the big hurt huh
jules that is wrong
uh  i saw that moving
you are not saying you actually you are saying that y
 wrote it yeah  i am the bad guy
i am so glad you did not jump on that train before
why would she come here
i never forgot that
it is two weeks
almost three
i am just thinking of how she is hurting  lost  alone  like her life is over
the kiss  may be hard  for you to explain  because the only fear she really has is
well the school will be here architecture will still be around right now
i travel every week  college ball motor sports training camps
because i could come
it is not just a gag huh
he never mentioned that  neither did y
he needs someone incredible someone really close who he can trust
it would only be maybe six months or three or four it would mean so much to him
and to m
i am sure glad i am hearing all this now before it is too late
what a sweet little picture  mommy and daddy are not losing a daughter they are gaining a eunuch
reverend dyer this is kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor
 i am partial to the tight end
and yet here you are  all celibate and reclusive
maybe it is happy there
oh the way out of the crab house we asked michael if we could see the ring
he said you told him  it would be safer with you

susanville soledade
lobotomy bay
you have heard of it
so how do i fit into this scheme

tough titty it is mine now

what i would like to do
how about manson
manson beat you
she does not talk

okay now before we get started here there's a few things we have to get clear about
all right mickey
sorry about that
do not worry about it
we are about ready to go here are you ready
so mickey tell us what you do for fun
then was it worth it
was what worth it
okayokayi will buy that we will move on and come back later
i am sure we will
describe mallory
that is indescribable
well riddle me this batman how do you feel about the fact that you are never gonna see mallory again
says who
says the united states of america
i could go for a coke
donut get your camera see if it is broke
let me check on scott he is hurt bad
yeah we have a van
where is it parked
out front
this is crazy you cannot escape like this
probably not but we are gonna give it the old college try
on average forty million
'every week by forty million people i am a respected journalist' have you won any awards
are you kidding the golden globe the edward r murrow award
we ai not got all fucking day
c'mon c'mon let's hurry this up
developed between the three of us we are kindda in this together do not ya think
wait you cannot kill me mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale
i cannot go i am too fucked up
no fucking way no fucking way
if they stay they will catch you and they do not have to catch you
no fucking way
yeah baby
and they made the first move
i admire them
through the power of the simple word
and a snakeeye glare
and a snakeeye glare arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him
he had the edge the mind's edge
mickey and mallory have that edge
only on a much grander scale
they have hypnotized the nation
that is the mickey and mallory way
that is the way of the world
they are shocking the world into remembering the primal law
just for fun i guess
and then mallory stops mickey and says 'hey these are the brothers hung
mickey stops sawing on my leg and says 'oh my god i am your biggest fang
apparently they have seen all our films
they were especially influenced by 'conquering huns of neptune'
so mallory calls 911 and they took off
here's the layout of the laundry room
what do you think pitney how much explosives do you think that they really have in there
it is hard to say capt'n
take a wild stab
i will say enough to destroy this wing

great  because like i said until you find it we cannot let you on the plane
you do not understand  the man i am supposed to marry is on that plane
you did not have that with you before  prima non l'aveva con se
you ask what room he is in okay
he could not have checked out i was supposed to meet him here
nobody here has any idea which way he went
so that is the story with your friend
my friend has lost her fucking mind
she is trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker
what for
my hair's kind of a mess is not it
you are sure
do not be afraid  you can tell me
you are sure
we found each other did not we
yes  we did
my name is not damon bradley  i just told you it was damon bradley
who's dying
your great aunt
you do not think this is just infatuation do you
there is one other thing you should know about me
nothing you could say would change the way i feel
i am engaged  i am supposed to be married in two days
a very large pig
ask her if she knows where he is
ask her if she knows how i might reach him  if she has a telephone number
has a prior commitment
that is mezzaluna
a restaurant  in piazza navona
i am not pushing it
larry can i borrow your car keys
faith this guy you think is mr right he is not what you think
do not worry it is a long story but i know who he is  i know where to find him
but faith

smoking or nonsmoking
hello  is anybody there
dwayne pinsley  i am trying to reach dwayne pinsley
he is not in at the moment  can i take a message
who's this
i am sure he will be sorry to hear that  who should i tell him called
my name's 
damon bradley
wait  where are you
i am at the airport  why
uh in case dwayne wants to try to reach you
where are you going
i am on my way to venice  why
venice  i love venice  with the boats right
that is not the point
you said whatever it was you would understand
how could you do this to me
i am in love with you
you are limping
i know i am limping  i stubbed my toe
why cannot you just tell me
if it is any of your business yes
because i know who dwayne is and he is reliable and stable and wants to marry me
he is safe
so  is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe
does he love you
he wants to marry me does not he
you did not answer my question
why are you asking me this
so it was not real
what about the oasis in the desert are you telling me that was a lie
why not

well what about books  you like hemingway  you gotta love hemingway
how about music  you like classical
well how about those old romantic movies with those great stars huh like audrey hepburn
i am sorry
yeah  well was the least i could do
promise me you will not leave without saying goodbye
hi  are you busy
no  are you are leaving
i know the feeling
yeah  well anyway i also wanted to tell you i am not getting married
you are not
no  i mean yes i am not  i decided to call it off  well actually it was kind of mutual
yes  i am
you cannot come to southern italy and not see the blue grotto
i just need to run up and get my bathing suit
is something the matter
reptilian swine  there's no such thing  reptiles are not swine
who cares  you hired an actor
i do not know what you are talking about  who told you that
alright  the truth is i thought we had something here
a little white lie  a little white lie
what would you call it
do not you think you are overreacting just a little here   we are talking about love okay  let's be rational
gee i am flattered  what an incredibly romantic gesture cancel the roses i have decided to lie to her instead
very funny
that is not the point  and what if i had wanted to
i was hoping for the real thing
you are damon bradley
beautiful place
been here long
any night
well not exactly
i will look forward to it
are not you going to tell me who you are
oh faith  my name's faith
well to new friends

nothing  prices are a little steep here are not they
what looks good
hmmmm well the scampi sounds good
so what do you think
faith this is my mother
oh hello
so you say you have been to italy before
i do not know i guess i never really thought about it  is larry here
i do not believe in statistics
what about that guy you work with mike that ishisname
no  he smokes
how about the other one  his friend
just moved in with his girlfriend
but somebody wrote those songs
so that is your point
just that they came out of somebody's experience is all
i wish you did not have to go so early
is he gay
that is he do
i do not know kate
you do not have any idea
no  he is never asked me
why do not you ask him
he begged me to marry him  i did not even want to marry him
yes you did
come on it is not so bad
look how big it makes me look  i look like an alp
i think it was sweet of him to pick it out
kate is something the matter
larry brought me flowers last night
is that bad
have you seen him with someone
it is a miracle
it is a coincidence
it was my new year's resolution to overcome it
but it is july
it is still the new year
what about your job
i have vacation time coming to me
because you were afraid to fly
would you stop saying that  i need you to do me a really big favor
does dwayne know about this
no i have not  and you forgot about the fortune teller
thank you so much
how hard can it be  i will land there i will go to his hotel i will introduce myself and
i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies
it is called the gritty palace
gritty  is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who do not believe in deodorant
of the rich and famous  of which we are neither  are you out of your mind  we cannot afford this
are you sure
yes  cathy lee crosby stayed here
i cannot believe we came all this way and he is gone
you gave it your best shot  you tried
i will never meet the man of my dreams
what are you doing
you cannot really blame him for being upset  it was an armani suit
did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned
i just got a dial tone
ah ha
what would you find
a butterfinger wrapper
a rich possibly fat slob
maybe there's fingerprints on it
we are not looking to arrest the man faith we are trying to locate him
we are saved
what is it
a phone message  only
only what
your brother
could not we just have taken a train
i am hungry
you know no offense or anything kate but i think i am starting to see larry's side of the story
you expecting somebody you know
you think he misses me at all
he went out and bought himself mengs cologne the other day  did i tell you that
her brother
what did you say to her
i do not know  i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden
i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he would notice me first
well how come we are always looking for guys for you
because i am the one who's single
i never even got to be single
sure you did
not if you do not count the sixth grade
he is heeeeeerrre
that was really sweet
i meant about my idea
i think it is time we got some professional help
like a detective
no like a psychiatrist
yeah  sociopaths  they are able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that
but how could he know  he only just met me
hi  where have you been
so you have had a little bad luck
why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place  children are very impressionable you know
i thought you were the one who did not think i should have come in the first place
i know but
it was a ouija board remember
what about peter
no  no you go ahead
you sure you will be okay
i am sure  and kate thank you for coming  thank you for being such a good friend
peter found him
joan collins stayed here
kate  thank god you are there i need help
not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist he says nuculear and irregardless
no one's perfect kate
and he is living proof
maybe i can change him
maybe if i kiss him i will feel it
he is a jerk
yes  he is
i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel
kate is that you
uh huh
well i realized if you are getting married you are gonna be needing the maid of honor right
and larry
i am fine  have you seen peter
he is gone  he told me what happened  he just left for the airport
you are looking for a place to stay no kate
no  well i do not know  well maybe  later
she is saying he is a a  porco
a porco
giovanni this is faith's friend peter
oh hello  i just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink but
how old are you
giovanni i want to thank you
you do not have to go if you do not want to
kate you are still there  i thought you would be on your way home by now
you miss me
uh yeah  sure  honey did you forget the guys are coming over tonight
no why
do not call me doll larry  i hate it when you call me doll
you used to love it when i called you doll
damon bradley  that is why you are here
larry you have got to tell her
i came after the woman i love
she what
she said she knew where to find him and then she grabbed my car keys and
and you did not tell her
i have to talk to her
she is not here
and if that is not destiny i do not know what is
i mean realistically what are the odds that this is a terrific guy
that is the guy you have been waiting for all these years
right now
he just got a call from mr upstairs something's gone wrong he is plenty hot
i am gonna take her home first
i would get over there terry i will take the little lady home
i will come over when i am ready
and do not be walking off with any of that you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage
talk louder i cannot hear you
if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth

i am not thirsty
i wish i knew
so do i charley for your sake
johnny i cannot do that i cannot do that johnny
then do not
you said they was only going to talk to him
that was the idea
i thought they would talk to him try to get him to dummy up
maybe he gave them an argument
i figured the worst they would do is work him over a little
come on kid i will buy you a drink
working hard
you do not mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position
why me charley i would feel funny going in there
johnny does you favors kid you got to do a little one for him once in a while
the complete works of timothy j nolan
river street i thought we was going to the garden
i have got to cover a bet there on the way over anyway it gives us a chance to talk
nothing ever stops you from talking charley
the grapevine says you picked up a subpoena
that is right 
there's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we are opening up
and for all that dough i do not do nothing
absolutely nothing you do nothing and you say nothing you understand do not you kid
yeah yeah i guess i do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than i thought charley
listen terry these piers we handle through the locals you know what they are worth to us
i know i know
well then you know cousin johnny is not going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubberlipped
do not say that
extanker who's walking on his heels

you should not ever say that about your parents not even your dad
what was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life
is this a good spot
i am not burying him here
why not
this is it i was not sure if it even really existed
what did
come on that is just a bullshit story you said so yourself
what if it is not bullshit if i bury zowie there and it works  he will come back alive
drew i know your dog died but get a grip man you are freaking me out
you want me to help
i have never had anyone die before  but i guess you get over it i mean eventually
maybe he was not dead when we buried him
you think my dad will figure out why he is not getting better
how can he not have a heartbeat
it is weird
what do you mean
what was that all about you think he is trying to scare us
do you think everyone that came back would be like gus
i gotta go back and do my chores
you ever think about running away
geoff  anybody see my boy
how long have you been here
how did it go with your father last night
good he said he would be over for dinner at eight  i mean he misses you mom

three full bottles but almost time to refill
'mean the whispers
you did this to yourself
slam doctor well we called him doctor
then where is he he is not in the hole we looked
power cells
they are coming
strange not doing a runup on the main drive yet  strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape
i got the quickandugly version
ang now you are worried about a repeat of history
entered our minds
riddickwas thinking we should make some kind of deal just in case you know this actually 
had it with deals
but i just wanted to say 
been a long time since anyone's trusted me that is something right there
we can cannot we trust you
where are the sandcat tracks why are not we still following them
what do you see riddick
canyon ahead i circled once to buy some time to think
what about her
back to the ship huh
how many you see
we are just here to carry your light are not we just the torchbearers
as fast as you can
you sure you can keep 
so where the hell's god now huh  i will tell you where he is up there pissing on me
tell me the settlement is right there riddick please
strong survival instinct admire that in a woman
i promised them we would go back with more light and that is exactly what we are gonna do
think you have mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck
ui trusted youu riddick goddamn i trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race
just come with me
they are already dead get on board
step aboard carolyn
i cannoti cannot
here make it easy on you
do not do this to me
just give me your hand
but theythey could still be
you would die for them
i would try for them
this is it booze uthat isu what you have to drink
what do my eyes see
just a suggestion but perhaps we should flee
christ you do not know that is out there
like the light is scalding it
one cutting torchone handlight here two more in the cabini uthinku two more
spirits anything over 45 proof burns well
how many bottles
not sure ten
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact but that sandcat will not run at night
let's move  just a detour he will get us there
can we switch
hey who
amazing i am johns
and him
big evil
we just keep him locked up forever
be my choice already escaped once from the maxslam facility on 
i do not need his life story is he really that dangerous
a very good sign  that is riddick's direction you do unotu wanna be caught in the dark with this guy
thought you found his restraints over there toward sunset
probably makes it worse dehydrates you even more
no no i wanted to get away
better keep moving
hey you can tell me carolyn
promise me swear to me you will not 
so now you know
no juice looks like it is been laid up for years but we might be able to adapt 
sorry thought i heard something
like what
i do not play thati do not play that so just try again c'mon riddick tell me a better lie
he used that
sir shivalot he likes to cut
so why is not it all bloody
well do not ask me to
thought you did not believe his story
nobody else is going down but me okay
hey being ballsy with your life now does not change what came before  it is just stupid
what you think i am doing this to prove something
you said it not me let's just not let one bad call lead to another
little rattyass
okay that should buy us a syscheck but we will need more cells
how many
15 6gigs here90 gigs totalother ship carries 20gig cells sofive five total to launch
rag it riddick nobody wants your theories on 
need those cells from the crash ship shit still gotta check out the hull patch the wings 
let's wait on the power cells

he can pilot
hijacked a prison transport made a helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down
okay maybe that is a ugoodu thing maybe i can use him to help with 
you said we were going to trust him now you said there was a deal
dancing on razor blades here
you are not a real cop are you just some mercenary who goes around talking about the law like 
i never said i was
you have a little caffeine in the morning i have a little morphine so what
and here you got two mornings every day wow were you ubornu lucky
owens was already dead his brain just had not caught on to that fact
stop it stop it stop it
oh lady if you are in your right mind i pray you go insane
look we gotta think about everyone now  the kid especially how scared is she gonna be out there
oh do not use her like that for a smoke screen
smoke screen for what
how much you weigh johns
what the hell's it matter
how much
he will lead you over the first cliff you know that do not you
so you noticed too
we are not completely stupid
i was wrong i admit it my bad okay now let's just go back to the ship
i dunno nice breeze wide open spaces  you know i am starting to enjoy myself out here
this does not help us johns
 she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin tried to kill us 
we cannot go through there
it is the atmosphere too much pressure not enough oxygen might take a few days to 
so what the bloody hell happened anyways
well is it just the pump
imam we should leave soon before nightfall but while it is cooler
why did i fall on you
you hear me captaings dead owens too
cannot get my nose downtoo much load back there
you mean that load of passengers
look fry company says we are responsible for every one of those 
company's not here is it
i do not suppose
so quiet you get used to the sounds of the ship then
you know who muhammad was
frightening thought
one is all
i saw the cutmarks on the bones was not a natural dieoff
they are afraid of our light that means we do not have to be so afraid of them
and you are certain you can find the way back even in the dark
do not stop just slow down  little more space 'tween us and them
i would rather we all stay
the sled as a shield
has anyone seen the young one ali
wellwe must keep her close then here she will be safe if we put her between 
where is mr johns
which half
what are you doing
blessing you like the others  it is painless
and pointless

he will be with us nonetheless

oh trash baby you are gonna regret this
we crossed our own tracks
she is the captain we should listen to 
then we saw this
king tut's tomb

what the hell are these
well just a skiff disposable really
very big beads
she is the pilot she should stay close to the cells
found something worse than me huh
want you to remember this moment riddick the way it coulda gone and did not
you would cut me loose boss
are you fucking kidding me
i would rather piss glass
well you got the big gauge
think about that reward johns
i am willing to take a cut in pay
ufuck meu you said clear
said looks clear
well that is it look like now
what are you jawjacking about girl's not cut
aw this cannot be happening to me
ai not all of us gonna make it

either way figure it is something you can grab onto
sacrifice play hack up one body leave it at start of the canyon like a bucket of chum
utrawlu with it there's a cable on the sled we can drag the body behind us
nice embellishment
do not wanna feed these landsharks  just keep 'em off our scent
so which one caught your eye
that is her name anyway
then let's not name the thanksgiving turkey okay i assume you still got a shiv
what you 'spect umeu to do it

just wondering if we do not need a bigger piece of chum
ang this
blowdart hunting stick from papua new guinea very uveryu rare since the tribe's extinct
'cuz they could not hunt shit with these things be my guess
so much for your nightfall
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life  so long as you have the luxuries
what you do not really think they left with their clothes on the lines photos on the walls
maybe they had weight limits you do not know
you were trying to kill him too
take it
what it is broken
mr penfield  i am sorry to have kept you

so it is all worked out perfectly
was that your chapter then  it was very good
can i give you a lift
what did you think of that wadja film
i quite liked it  i was not as enthusiastic as everyone else
i thought it was tremendous
i think it went on rather too long
i could not bear for it to end
and i did not like that man
oh but he was terrific
and the shape of it all  it was sort ofshapeless
really  i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good
you do not like flashbacks because your mother's a historian
good theory  but i like my mother i have no aversions to what she does
too bad  what did your father do
and you are at this third stage
no there's a fourth  numbness you do everything right but you feel nothing either way
i think you are exaggerating  and if you are not you should jolly well change your job
both dead
i called you a taxi
very thoughtful
why not stay
i have to be up early 
me too
two or three years ago i would have stayed  and fucked you
you do not trust me
i do not trust anyone  that is what comes of working in television
in radio we are different
i might see you in norfolk over the weekend
i think we are ready now thank you  and how was norfolk  did you get on with my mother
i think she liked me
did she talk about me
do you think she is invited you up for her sake or for mine
i have not really thought about it

no  it is a bit of a madhouse for some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues
look will you come on a walk with me tomorrow

the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they are broken
you do not believe me

who are you
to think  all that time it was your cup that was poisoned
catch your breath
if you will release me  whatever you ask for ransom  you will get it i promise you
i never said he was my dearest love and yes he will save me that i know
you admit to me you do not love your fiance
he knows i do not love him

rest highness
you are the dread pirate roberts admit it
with pride what can i do for you
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces
does it bother you to hear
 as  you  wish
farm boy polish my horse's saddle i want to see my face shining in it by morning
farm boy fill these with water   please
i fear i will never see you again
of course you will
but what if something happens to you
hear this now i will come for you
but how can you be sure
can you move at all
move you are alive if you want i can fly
i told you i would always come for you why did not you wait for me
well  you were dead
death cannot stop true love all it can do is delay it for a while
i will never doubt again
we will never survive
singed a bit were you
but how is that possible since he is been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago
we will never succeed  we may as well die here
westley what about the rous's
we did it
oh westley will you ever forgive me
what hideous sin have you committed lately
i got married i did not want to it all happened so fast
but it did i was there this old man said man and wife
did you say i do
i did that on purpose i do not have to miss
i believe you  so what happens now
frankly i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting
look are you just fiddling around with me or what
you are quick
and a good thing too
it is fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder
who's guilder
no more rhymes now i mean it
i only dog paddle
i thought i was going faster
you were supposed to be this colossus you were this great legendary thing and yet he gains
well i am carrying three people and he is got only himself
 i do not accept excuses  i am just going to have to find myself a new giant that is all
you be careful   people in masks cannot be trusted
give her to me  catch up with us quickly
what do i do
finish him finish him your way
probably he means no harm
he is really very short on charm
oh you have a great gift for rhyme
fezzik are there rocks ahead
you do not look so good  you do not smell so good either
he is with the prince in the castle but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men
how many could you handle
to find the man in black obviously
but you do not know where he is
the man in black
 fezzik please 
well we montoyas have never taken defeat easily come along fezzik bring the body
the body
have you any money
i have a little
inigo  there's more than thirty 
that is the difference  we have got him help me here we will have to force feed him
has it been fifteen minutes
tilt his head back open his mouth
you have been mostly dead all day
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had
will this do
where did you get that
do not pester him he is had a hard day
he is getting away from me fezzik please fezzik
i brought you a special present
what is it
yeah it is really good
hold it hold it
what is this are you trying to trick me  where is the sports  is this a kissing book
 wait just wait 
it was a very emotional time for buttercup 
the eel does not get her i am explaining to you because you looked nervous
well maybe i was a little bit concerned but that is not the same thing
because i can stop now if you want
oh no no please
they are kissing again do we have to hear the kissing part
someday you may not mind so much
well who says life is fair where is that written life is not always fair
i am telling you you are messing up the story now get it right
it was ten days till the wedding the king still lived but buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse
see did not i tell you she would never marry that rotten humperdinck
westley's only faking right
you want me to read this or not
who gets humperdinck
i do not understand
who kills prince humperdinck at the end somebody's got to do it is it inigo who
no i am okay i am okay   sit down all right
what what
no it is kissing again you do not want to hear it
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow
many of the thieves will resist my regular enforcers will be inadequate
form a brute squad then i want the thieves' forest emptied before i wed
it will not be easy sire
rise and report
the thieves' forest is emptied thirty men guard the castle gate
double it my princess must be safe
you mean you wish to surrender to me very well i accept
i tell you once again  surrender
for the last time  surrender
a technicality that will shortly be remedied but first things first to the death
no  to the pain
i do not think i am quite familiar with that phrase
i will explain and i will use small words so that you will be sure to understand you warthogfaced buffoon
i was not finished  the next thing you lose will be your left eye followed by your right 
 and then my ears i understand let's get on with it
there was a mighty duel  it ranged all over they were both masters
who won how did it end
the loser ran off alone  the winner followed those footprints toward guilder
could this be a trap
once we are out of sight take him back to florin and throw him in the pit of despair
she is been like that ever since the fire swamp  it is my father's failing health that is upsetting her
your guess is as good as mine 
who are you  are we enemies why am i on this wall  where is buttercup 
and it is guarded by sixty men
and our assets
why you cannot even lift one
where is fezzik
hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
 all that i have and more please 
 offer me everything i ask for 
 anything you want 
what what
he is already dead
we are really in a terrible rush
this is noble sir  his wife is crippled his children are on the brink of starvation
are you a rotten liar
i need him to help avenge my father murdered these twenty years
humiliations galore
thank you for everything
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top
that is very comforting but i am afraid you will just have to wait
i hate waiting i could give you my word as a spaniard
you do not know any way you will trust me
we will wait until you are ready
well i certainly hope you find him someday
you are ready then
you seem a decent fellow i hate to kill you
i thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain 
you are wonderful
i admit it  you are better than i am
because i know something you do not know
and what is that
you are amazing
there's something i ought to tell you
tell me
who are you
no one of consequence
i must know
making sure nobody's following us
stop doing that we can all relax it is almost over
go in get after her
look he is right on top of us i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using
i want to duel him lefthanded
you know what a hurry we are in
well it is the only way i can be satisfied if i use my right  tch  over too quickly
let me explain
perhaps an arrangement can be reached
but if there can be no arrangement then we are at an impasse
i am afraid so  i cannot compete with you physically and you are no match for my brains
you are that smart
really in that case i challenge you to a battle of wits
i accept
inhale this but do not touch
truly you have a dizzying intellect
you are trying to trick me into giving away something  it will not work 
it has worked  you have given everything away  i know where the poison is
then make your choice
that is so funny
true love he said true love max my god 
do not say another word valerie
he is afraid ever since prince humperdinck fired him his confidence is shattered
why would you say that name  you promised me that you would never say that name 
what humperdinck humperdinck humperdinck oooooo humperdinck
i am not listening
a life expiring and you do not have the decency to say why you will not help 
nobody's hearing nothing
an hour
yeah an hour
byebye boys
have fun storming the castle
think it will work
you feeling any better
a little bit
your grandfather's here
mom cannot you tell him that i am sick
you are sick that is why he is here
he will pinch my cheek i hate that
i did not think the police went searching for people who were not in trouble
we have reason to believe she came this way might have stopped in this area  did she stop here
no no one has stopped here in weeks
mind looking at the picture before committing yourself
committing myself to what you sure talk like a policeman
no at least i do not recall
it was raining and her hair did not look like that damped out i guess
how early
very early dawn
of which morning
the following morning sunday
you did not spend the whole night with her did you
no of all
back where
what do you mean
and when she left she never came back
why should she i am sorry i have work to do mr if you do not mind
i do mind if it do not jell it ai not aspic  this ai not jelling
i do not know what you expect me to know about people come and go
she is not still here is she
not at all
suppose i wanted to search the cabins all twelve would i need a warrant
i guess i have got one of those faces you cannot help believing
anyone at home
i live there alone
someone is sitting in that window
she is ill confined to her room it is practically living alone
if this girl mary crane were here you would have no reason to hide her would you
of course not
if she paid you well
i am not a fool and i am not capable of being fooled not even by women
i did not mean that as a slur on your manhood i am sorry
that is all right maybe she could have fooled me  but  she did not fool my mother
your mother met her  can i talk to your mother
no i told you she is confined
just for a moment she might have picked up a hint you would miss
let's all talk about mary
who are you friend
somebody better tell me that is going on and tell me fast i can take so much and then
must have needed it
did you check in phoenix hospitals maybe she had an accident a holdup
she was seen leaving town in her car seen by her very victims i might add
i do not know
not even a hunch just hope
with a little checking i could get to believe you
can i trade in my car and take another
you can do anything you have a mind to and being a woman you will  that yours
that is the one i would have picked for you myself
five hundred
aha always got time to argue money huh
i think i have the necessary papers is there a ladies room
i would really rather not please  cannot we just settle this and
i would like to be ready when he gets back
are not you going to take the pills  they will knock that headache out
yes mr lowery
caroline mary still is not in
no mr lowery but then she is always a bit late on monday mornings
you better run out to the house she may be unable to answer the phone
will you help us i think something's wrong out there
now your sister is missing how long
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday and no trace until
she stole some money
a lot
forty thousand dollars
mary had been there one night and had left
what difference does that
did he say anything about my sister
is something wrong
i do not know where in your store somewhere in your town anywhere
that is the matter
what should i know
to begin with where mary is do you
a good reason i suppose
i was getting to that
what do you know about it
what thing could we be in together
i hate tears 
well why did not she come to me call me
not that kind  you men and your egos
yes i just did the moment they told me
it was her boss' idea not to report it to the police
no the man whose money she he talked so loud and fast and i i should have called the police
he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it all that cash
she have not even called you
you want me to stay here
she will need both of us
sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound ever notice lila
sam he said an hour or less
it is been three
are we just going to go on sitting here
he will be back let's sit still and hang on okay
you have an awfully nice habit sam
i feel better when you feel better
that would not be a wise thing to do
patience does not run in our family sam i am going out there
arbogast said
got the number of the motel out on the old highway bates i think 
sam why call when we can go
probably on his way back right now
sam i am going
stay here
why cannot i go out there with you
i do not know  one of us has to be here in case arbogast's on the way
just wait here
where could he have gone
maybe he got some definite lead maybe he went right on
without calling me
let's go see al chambers
who's he
nothing  just all the lights out must be asleep
does that mean we cannot
no thank you it is my problem too
i have only been here five right now it feels like ten but
maybe i am the seeingillusions type
i will not feel satisfied unless i got out there sam
i wonder if we will ever see mary again
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting
we should have asked for cabin one the one mary was in
that is proof mary was here  it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to
bates never denied mary was here
yes  but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money
you cannot go up there
it is regular okay
what do i do with my free afternoon walk you to the airport
i have heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels they say it
when you are married you can do a lot of things deliberately
i have lost my girlish laughter
the only girlish thing you have lost
sam this is the last time
okay what do we do instead write each other lurid love letters
i have not time to argue i am a working girl
you cannot laugh at it huh
can you
and besides when you say i make tax deductible excuses you make me out a criminal
i have to go sam
and after the steak do we send sister to the movies and turn mama's picture to the wall
sam no
i have not even been married once yet
yeah but when you do you will swing
i am thinking of it
how can you even think a thing like that
do not miss your plane
hey we can leave together cannot we
dirty night
you have a vacancy
we have twelve vacancies twelve cabins twelve vacancies  they moved away the highway
i thought i would gotten off the main
your home address oh just the town will do
i want sleep more than anything except maybe food
there's a big diner about ten miles on up just outside fairvale
am i that close to fairvale
the bathroom
i will be in the office if you want anything just tap on the wall
thank you mr bates
you have something most girls never have
i have
there's no name for it but it is something that that puts a person at ease
thank you again
i have caused you some trouble
mother  what is the phrase she is not herself today i think that is it
you are very kind
you eat like a bird
it is a strange hobby curious i mean
uncommon too
a man should have a hobby
it is more than a hobby sometimes a hobby is supposed to pass the time not fill it
only my share
where are you going i do not mean to pry
i am looking for a private island
what are you running away from
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps
i was born in mine i do not mind it anymore
you should mind it
except you
a son is a poor substitute for a lover 
why do not you go away
to a private island like you
an institution a madhouse  people always call a madhouse someplace  put her in someplace
yes and just one time can be enough  thank you
you are not going to to your room already
why do not you stay a little while just for talking
i would like to but
alright i will see you in the morning i will bring you breakfast  what time will you
very early dawn
that is it 
you slept here all night
yes as i said i could not keep my eyes
there are plenty of motels in this area you should have i mean just to be safe
i did not intend to sleep all night i just pulled over have i broken any laws
no m'am
then i am free to go
is anything wrong
of course not am i acting as if something's wrong
frankly yes
please i would like to go
i am sorry
wait a minute
we have a problem
mary is lila's sister
yes he traced her to that motel out on the old highway
bates' motel  he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it go on sam
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs bates
you mean that old woman i saw sitting in the window was not norman bates' mother
maybe you saw mary
we thought if you did not mind we would go out to the motel with you
recluse kinder word
went out before service
just coming up to ring for you
i will take you to
i will get your bags
have not any
that would be a rather extreme reaction would not it
my mother is not dead
you look frightened have i been saying something frightening
i do not know what you have been saying
i have been talking about your mother about your motel how are you going to do it
do what
buy a new one in a new town where you will not have to hide your mother
leave me alone
forty thousand dollars
mother please
and then what after supper music whispers
they thought she would be coming to me
was that all
now wait a minute sam you sure you saw an old woman
yes in the house behind the motel i pounded and called but she just ignored me
you did not find anything
what is it
the wound is bleeding
what is it now
i am losing my blood
what were you dreaming about

that spoke to you
that called  commanded

uhhh gahdam stuff
what did you say brother
i said ahhhdam stuff
no you did not say that brother
children children be quiet all of you  the vibrations in this house are strange today where is rose anyhow
she is getting herself up to go out
what would you say brother
she is getting herself up to go out i think she is coming down the hall now
it is pitiful neither one of them know
i think daddy suspects
it is really pitiful she is in bad shape
i think she is gonna kiss him
i cannot see what are they doing that is happening
they are discussing it
this is my place and you cannot have it
ohhhhh that is happening now
he is trying to get up  good god one of her titties is out
now i cannot see what are they doing
wow brrrother
what are they doing
buddy this is amazing you would not believe it
what are they doing doll
he kissed her
is that all
he had his hand on her titty
she is putting the titty back
buddy that was pretty snotty of you pushing me away like that just when it was interesting
no mother he is lying
chattanooga i had st louis missouri
buddy i am worried about rose
so am i
then why does she act so dumb
buddy does rose really do it with all those boys and men
that is going on
rose says she is going to have a baby and she sure looks it but i do not think so
why is it taking so long
well you rascal where would you come from
it is not yankee whisky daddy it is scotch
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow
that is all this about rose what do you mean you heard from her in a manner of speaking
oh i heard from her i got a letter from her she is fine but there is some sad news
what sad news did her cancer come back
oh no no she got all over that rose is fine let's sit down son
the pitiful son of a bitch said rose was a nymphomaniac
he did not lose her he threw her away
at rest in the creative universe with mother son
that is what she would say herself
no son she is dead
i cannot believe it daddy i know it must be true but i cannot believe it
why rose why rose daddy
nobody lives forever boy who would want to
i am ahead of you
then may i speak quite frankly with you mr hillyer
please do
i have of course observed the girl in treating her
of course
i think we both know her
good morning sweetheart beautiful day
yes it is so nice i thought i would work outside
how goes it darling
slow hon but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here
your hearing aid it is buzzing at me like a snake
oh did you say something
umhmm almost too perfect
and she is such a goodhearted thing there is not an ounce of harm or malice in her
well i will admit i do not see any flies on her yet
there are no flies on rose i do not know what you are talking about
well let's hope for the best darling
forgive my crudity darling i do not understand these deeper things the way you do
lay off of that stuff son it upsets your mother
i am serious we forget he is just a child i wish you would speak to him
who does not have such thoughts  we would better get going
that farmer in gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her and i am beginning to see why
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children
you are the one who's goodhearted  as for rose let's hope for the best
be kind to her she loves you so much  in a perfectly proper way of course
well she is back

quarter of twelve
is she all right
why should not she go out and have boyfriends
no reason at all darling
well time will tell will not it
oh shut up rose shut your mouth and quit crying
i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl
i am not being brutal to her
you certainly are she has an awful toothache look at her jaw it is all swollen
scoundrels they were not scoundrels they were just boys
i do not intend to fire her darling
who is to say our morals are better than hers  but maybe you are right she could influence dolly
now look darling this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension
darling rose has got to go
excuse me sir are you calling my wife a liar
i cannot stand that polecat they ought to hang him
you do not like him because he is a yankee he is a brilliant doctor
she cannot get a job it is a depression and we cannot just throw her out on the street
she does look a little peaky
she already told you she does not know
ah ha hold the phone no forwarding address huh  in the shock of this brilliant move i forgot something

and now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars any comment
we do not serve formula snookums
oh a ladies man huh
no  but neither does roger  that is diablo red  roger's pants are sunrise orange
well i will be
make it dry  baby does not like to be wet  you are valiant right  the name's baby herman
i know who you are  kinda out of your neighborhood are not you
yeah i had to go slumming  see a friend of mine's being framed
so where is it then
my hunch is it was maroon  he always was after acme's property
gee it is swell to see you eddie  we miss you in toontown
wish i could say the same  what are you doing here betty
work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color  but i still got it eddie  'boop boop bedoop'
yeah you still got it betty  who's mr jocularity
that is marvin acme the gag king
shoulda guessed
he comes here every night to see jessica rabbit
big on the musical comedy huh
that is this roger
i have already dropped it on you twentythree times
do not worry about me  i can take it
is this paper even good
check the scrawl
hey eddie looks like you really stepped in it this time
a new outfit bought the red car  some big company called cloverleaf industries
no kidding  bought the red cars huh
do you think the rabbit did it
yeah eddie it is not like you got an ad in the yellow pages
the papers said the safe door was opened eddie
so you are not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit is getting framed
jesus eddie is this who i think it is
he is a riot
oh yeah  well you are not handcuffed to him  anybody in the back room
so you decided to help him after all
can you get him out of it eddie
what was uthatu
uthatu was the rabbit is wife
the rabbit is wife  wanna tell me what she was doing with her arms around you
probably looking for a good place to stick a knife
i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate
maroon right
nope  it is that cloverleaf outfit again
what the hell would they want with a gag factory
that is that coming from the bar
sounds like singing
i will bet
are you gonna call him eddie
what have i got to lose  you okay dolores
why would he contact me  i just took some lousy pictures
so you would not have any idea where he might be
being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective  what were you looking for mr valiant
take it easy bongo  we will handle mr valiant our own way downtown
downtown  fine  get a hold of santino i would be more than glad to talk to him
you are not taking me to downtown utoonutown
indeed we are  we will continue the interrogation there
i do not think it is gonna matter sorry pal i tried
these roads can be very treacherous at night especially in a maniacal toon vehicle
so you are cloverleaf
come on doom  what would a company like that want with toontown
do not you think anyone's gonna notice that toontowngs gone
here's one for the books a toon wearing human clothes
earl it is me valiant
eddie  jesus what happened
toon cops worked me over
boy i will say  they gave you a real toonaroo
does it hurt
last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir  maybe that is what he was after
hello mr valiant  i rang the doorbell but i guess you could not hear it
oh well i i just had to see you
come on lady have not you ever seen a mole before
toons are not given imperfections
yeah i will bet you would  you gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work
so altruistic
you shot roger
lady i guess i had you pegged wrong
it was doom who killed acme you know
why did not you tell me
i did not know who i could trust
we are even  by the way i did find your husband
where is he
how did you get onto doom
so where is it
when i opened up the blue envelope all that was inside was a blank piece of paper
looks like our goose is cooked our hash is slung our fait is accompli
lemme guess where you got that from tell me something what would you ever see in that guy anyway
hold on a second
tell me you did not do a snoop job for a toon named roger the rabbit
now what
they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was making the other day
what a gasser
where would this gargoyle come from anyway
valiant did you see the rabbit
he was blowing his lines all right so what
how much do you know about show business valiant
one too many safes dropped on his head
so what do you want me to do
get me a couple juicy pictures something i can wise the rabbit up with
the job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks
a hundred bucks  that is ridiculous
i got him on loan from disney
when will i hear from you
well you better start thinking about drinking it black
sonofabitch  mr maroon i think i will be going now so about the rest of my fee
hi mr maroon  remember me
valiant  what are you doing here
i just thought i would drop by and show you a photograph
i have already seen your photographs
maroon  whaddaya want
have you got the will
maybe  why
meet me at my studio at nine o'clock if you have got the will maybe we can stop this thing
valiant  you surprised me
you are not too good at this are you rk
no i am not  i am a cartoon maker not a murderer
you got the will in there do not ya
no i do not
you tricked me damn you
take it easy
pattycake  pattycake
my advice  hop on over to reno get yourself a quickie divorce
what the hell are you doing
i needed a place to hide  i am in trouble eddie
so i hear  even talking to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting
do not worry eddie no one knows i am here
if you are so innocent why would you run
eddie valiant you are under arrest just kidding
hey  what do you think you are doing
sorry eddie i forgot you are not a toon
does this help
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time
are you always this funny or only on days when you are wanted for murder
my philosophy is if you do not have a sense of humor you are better off dead
yeah  i think maroon plays the part of the sound mind your wife the sound body
i resent that innuendo  my wife is completely innocent
the habeus corpus is thickening
yeah  except they screwed up  i do not think they got the will
angelo  he is a pal a chum
an arsonist and a kidnapper  he just got outta prison
well i still do not think he would turn me in
just because you got 'em to laugh
a laugh can be a powerful thing eddie sometimes it is the only weapon we have in life
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety
i have met some cynical and miserable humans in my time  but you edward valiant are positively funereal
hey does not the rabbit even get a last request
a blindfold cigarette noseplugs just kidding
here you go kid say hi to casper for me
but eddie you know what happens when
oh eddie that was quick thinking nothing like using the old noggin the noodle the grey matter
valiant and valiant  who's the other valiant
so that is our plan our scenario our modus operandi
gee i did not recognize you i have never seen you laugh before  that your brother making the rabbit ears
you damn toon  no wonder they picked you for the patsy  always gotta play the fool  you make me sick
a toon  noooo
yeah a toon  it was the guy who killed bambi's mother
i will get it
wrong number
gee eddie you are not gonna go are ya  maroon will be laying for ya at nine o'clock
that is why i will be there at 845
i tell you what maybe i better come with you
you know eddie i am not as much of a chump and a patsy a yokel as you think
how much is a shave and a haircut roger
two bits
real good rog but maybe you better let me take over
i think you oughta read it to her
no kid you are a real hero
and i am glad you got your sense of humor back  think you will keep it
pretty good cigar  where would you get it
do you have it
always in a rush you are  all these years i have known you you could never wait for anything
this is important
do you really think so
we kept it
and then sam you and i clean up whatever's left to be cleaned
well i do not
you go shoot me if you want vincent but you will be dead before i hit the ground
only the stupid ones  cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets  besides i am not ira no more
it is good to see you have all got such faith in our little undertaking
who the fuck are you
i drive  and my name is larry  larry from the states
so that is the deal
then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous
and you believed me  but it was not my people who did it
i never did trust that blonde fuck
what is
best beer in the world known to man or god
oh yeah  whatta you drink then
when we are done with this i want to do for that one myself
now there's the deirdre i know
so you thought that maybe i would grown too attached to this charade i have been playing is that it
it is been known to happen
not to me you know that
problem my ass  i think you are lying to me and if you are you are a dead man
what in bloody hell is going on
they are part of the team  one of them's the guy i told you about
from interpol
lose them
about time
good christ  cannot you lose these jokers
do i need to repeat myself
sam  i am a weapons guy
i did not think to see you again tonight you were pretty pissed
i still am
is that right
look sam do not take it the wrong way when i tell you we will not be doing this again
you are a hired gun deirdre  just like me
i better be getting that
duty calls
well if it is not mr interpol himself  i cannot believe i misjudged you like i did
oh pleaseyou are on some sort of holy mission
i am a patriate
i did not say i was
are you alright
not me  you work too often with the same people and you become friends  clouds your judgement
it is quite satifactory
you sure about this
i would stake my reputation
but would you stake your life that is the question
alright gregor i am
where is the case
do not do it sam
shut up
we will double your price
really  do you have the money with you
do you have the material
you first edvard
perhaps we could both go at the same time
do you have it
not so fast  who's that
he is company
bad company
here's yours
there's been a slight problem
i take it you still want the money
where is my information
edvard said the same thing about you before he died
and more importantly 
we will die if we stay here
this better be the real thing or you are a dead man
it is i am telling you it is
but you hate each other
so you have got it all figured do you
i swear
then where is it
i sent it to myself in paris
sent it where
is it done
gregor is that you
much to your disappointment no doubt
a means to an end is that it
that is it
then i guess we are set
there is one other thing
what are you doing
do not cross me
i need you swede i cannot do this without you
i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with
hello jeanpierre
he is tough your american friend
yes sam's tough alright
and you respect him
of course  do not you
i have never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through  he is a cop
not exactly
not exactly  but close enough eh  so he saved your life then
how did you know
are you sure you will not have a drink
you think you can stitch me up on you own
do not worry we will take care of it
some thanks  enough to move on for now
he sees this differently as you well know
so this is what a test
if i was healthy i could take that away from you
so what is it you want to know
you shoot alright
gets the job done
all in the stomach though  your man might live
not for long
long enough to shoot back
is that right
it is been known to happen
yeah well  my way works too
what are you gonna do call him up and ask him to give us back our shit
what are you talking about man  i do not understand
what a surprise
they call me swede
you should watch what you eat
who the fuck died and appointed you food czar
i am just worried about your health larry  you could stand to shed a few pounds
and you could stand to get a little smarter ai not that right you dumb blonde fuck
i ride with fatboy
where is this broad
you should learn a little patience
is that right
it is consider a virtue in some corners of the world
sorry i am late
what makes you think we are here to meet you
perhaps the police
he trusts you to lock up
i am vincent  and i coordinate
coordinate what
where to
to see a man about a thing
pretty much what you would expect
he says this is their block
as in they own it
something like that
and i suppose he is saying that we oughta give them something for using it huh
i did not know that you spoke french
what would you say to him
same thing is not it
not at all  similar but not the same
that is the difference
help yourself  since when do you smoke
i have i do not know maybe a cigarette a week
a cigarette  as in one  one cigarette a week who smokes like that
it has it is moments  course you get cancer and die that is the down side
like larry or swede
watch that one he is an exspook for sure maybe stasi maybe kgb  he is smart gregor is
so is the woman
deirdre  smart yeah and seriously goddamned dangerous
i wonder if she truly left the ira
i have wondered that myself  none of this answers my question though  why bring me
i wanted to see who you were
they certainly are  whatever it is we are going to steal it must be quite something
that is going on
i just wanted to see something
i needed to know
how did you know
know what
but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did
the question still remains what do we do now
i came up here to sneak a smoke
you were smoking
i hope you do not mind i took your pack it was on the table
i borrowed that too
of coursewhenever you feel like it just help yourself
it was at that
a lot of people died
i have seen a lot of people die before
i have not  not like that  how do you get used to it
you are a copyou are a fucking copi should kill you
that makes twice now you have saved my life
i did not save your life back there risked it maybe  but i did not save shit
you see it your way i will see it mine you need a doctor
you know one around here  somebody you trust
noi thought i would take you to the hospital
no hospitals  i will fix this myself if i have to
fix it yourself  why are we even doing this  there's no need to run christ  you are a cop
not exactly
it looks to me like we are all that is left of our group
we  there is no we in my world now vincent just me
i am going with you
this does not involve you do not you understand  i cannot even guarantee you any money out of all this
it is not about money for me not anymore
you do not have to do this
alright it is done
you know him
that is this
the address of the russian production company  just in case we need to find them
you sure your friend got the right place
tell me sam why do you do this
do what
continue when it would be so much easier to give it up
it is my job
then quit  you do not work for interpol sam
i am a field agent  last of an already extinct breed  i do dark ops
dark ops
dark operations  wet work  kidnaping assassination
very ugly
it is at that
not very zen of you huh  not so much the modern samurai after all
i never made that claim
i know  jeanpierre did
you would have done that
i would have tried not to  but yes if it would have kept him from shooting you i would have
how could you have done that
they do not have the package
you think
what the fuck happened
i do not know
give me a cigarette
right now
i am not here very much
business keeps you on the road
so i do it
no you do not and you know it
if our positions were reversed would you leave me
in a minute
do we need anything else
time to quit
what of it  samurai pain in the ass
because i do not walk away
that is a good question
do you have a good answer
you have to stop doing that
let's get him out of here
finish the job
and now
you speak french
i know
you better get some sleep alright
what happened to it
gone  destroyed
i told you i quit
you sure
why's that
cause the russian production company would be easier to find
it is the irish tape we want
last i heard there was a film rep for the irish players staying at this address name of seamus reilly
why did not you kill her
you slept with her
you slept with her
you should have kill him when you had the chance  but no
you put everything on the line because you
my man how you doing

a friend  i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes
do you have the tape
you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape

tony and i have to talk some business first
i gotta try and overcharge him he has to moan about the price we settle somewhere in the middle
sort of
what the hell happened here
i would like to know what they were doing in my town  did you get id off any of them
whatsamatter with you  are not you concerned about all of this
i do not know what you are 
ready to roll partner
do not spend it all in one place
how old is otis anyhow thirty
thanks for the loan man  i will have it in a few days i promise
well i hope so  that pretty much cleaned me out
i would have asked my sister but its better to leave family out always leads to trouble
seven thousand
he would have won more but he blew it at the end  did not know what cash and carry was
cash and what
cash and carry you know fdr world war two
never heard of it
oh you would have done great
what the hell
ten thousand right here
there must be over a million dollars in here
what are we going to do
what do you mean what are we going to do
call it in i guess  why
no  we cannot
look around you partner  you said yourself you never saw anything like it
well someone's gonna find them
i told trudy we were coming down this way that is why
we would never have to worry about money  ever again jesus
suppose someone knows about the money  they are bound to ask questions
who's going to question us dwayne  jesse
it is going to go bigger than that could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it
i will worry about that when it happens and if it happens and it is not gonna happen
what makes you so sure
oh so god's like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks
that is right
all right hold on  lemme think  shit did you touch the car
we will torch the bases how is that
i have got one condition
what are you gonna do
i do not know  son of a bitch who the hell are you
how long you been lying there playing possum with us huh answer me
i am not letting some gangbanger send me to jail  we cannot risk it
ii cannot do that
okay then  i will do it
we are dead  we are dead we are dead  what are we going to do
i do not know
that guy was a federal agent an officer of the law just like us
well we did not know that at the time
we assaulted a federal agent  we killed him
we gotta turn ourselves in before they hear the tape
are you nuts  they will fry us for sure  there's no way we are doing that you understand  no way
it is the right thing to do
i should have known something like this was going to happen
how long you been lying there playing possum with us huh answer me
what are you thinking
i cannot do that
he would have done it to us right
i could kill that no good son of a bitch
all right enough  i am tired of thinking about all this
or get rid of the money  i do not know
i have got a better idea  all we have to do is straighten out jesse
and how do you figure we do that
all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape  we will set him up somehow
he is probably made copies  he is not going to give them up to us
he is going to be trouble
you said that last time
you are out of your mind
look earl  we gotta go straight this is all messed up
if you are any friend at all you will stop talking like that
well what are we supposed to do
you are crazy
how badly do you want that money how bad do you want to stay out of jail
not bad enough to kill him
how long is it going to take
what are you thinking  we were only supposed to scare him
here it is
even if we have the tape that would not shut him up
you killed him
it is gonna be ok
jesus christ earlwhat are we doing
we are doing what we gotta do to protect ourselves
maybe we should say something
come on booth grabs the bag 
do you have everything
i do not know for sure but why else would they head for the bank
it was all used  random numbers how can they trace it
i do not know  they got all kinds of hightech shit nowadays

look he is running after her
look he is in pretty good shape
ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support
in vino veritas
the real story on miss carpenter
the anatomy of the black widow spider of maryland
it would not be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again
if she runs then it is a cover story all true  all accurate
paid vindication  that is what i call justice
justice yes  paid i do not know they like the idea but my hands are tied with budget restraints
this is about her negative attention not mine  did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet
no i am paying for the dress  do you think she is still gonna run
look  i will be in there later today i will come by and tell you all about it
then come for dinner

i have no idea what i am doing
your job is the ring  do you have the ring
get this man a kamikaze
she is a cacophony of contradictions
well i am writing another article on the cacophony
ah cannot stay away from her can you like a moth to a flame
guess you would know about that  you are an entomologist right  how is business
not bad  i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me
same as you said  what did you call her  a maneater a devouring death goddess
i do not think that is why she ran
i do not know  i am working on it  i was on the wrong track
and you defending her
no  i call it like i see it  i am a journalist  i am a truth teller
unbelievable she got to you
sorry no  i just got one

good fact  well you let me know
it is okay  there's no microphone you are no fun
hello  i am looking for maggie carpenter  there was a sign at the hardware store across the street
about her upcoming wedding and all
i am just such a reporter  and you are
and you are
looking for maggie
i think you would look good in red
have you listened to his morning show wake up with ballplayer
not yet  i had a phlemless morning  i hear he is a pretty good ballplayer
this game is pretty important to him he made allstars in high school you know
yes i am  and who are you
betty trout  five dollars
oh betty  i take it you are going to be making the wedding cake and they say you are throwing 
your two cinnamon rolls
you should thank lou and i for the wedding car  a '63 buick
thank you
they made me put my hat back on
gee i hope they do not have a fight out there  you do not think they will call it off
well wedding cake freezes  this we know
like her mother
i hope you have a different angle it is pretty much all been covered
well instead of a haircut how about a wash  you know get all that city grit out of it
i am not here to make you feel bad  i am here for vindication  in my heart
you are going to be very disappointed
that is fair
how romantic
we think so
grandma made me the cutest outfit  i cannot wait to show it to you
look look man  i think the man is heartbroken
you have been here for three minutes what did you do to her
i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers
it is a birthday present for my cousin put your finger in
maybe someday
you afraid to try
always a mood killer
it is a little silence of the lambs for me  i cannot believe you waited for the wedding to run
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life  cal ripken even applauded
highly suspect
what do you mean  it was incredibly romantic
i am a work in progress
so  is that what you said to her
no  i think i said something eloquent like so uh  maybe we should ya know  what do you think
i do not know
you look uh you look fine
fine  the newspaper's upside down that is better than fine
i will have the same
of course
tell me  when you get to the altar will you spike the bouquet
ike hi grandma
it was in the attic  it was jus sitting there gathering dust
it is valuable  hang onto it
your filter's clogged  this takes unleaded
can you fix it
first i have to find some tools  i need a half and a ninesixtenth
of what
kind of isolated
where did you disappear to
i do not know give me a minute  are you all right with this
excuse me
i am the only goddamn person in there pulling for you
you humiliated me
no maggie i defended you humiliating you is what everyone else is doing  it is the theme of this party
i had it under control  now they feel sorry for me
it is fun  it is high
or the sexual habits of locusts
that was very interesting research george was doing
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo
i already explained about that
and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai
brian told you that
or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress
no  no  actually let's make ike the pastor
i would rather not
i am sorry bob  she kissed me back
about a minute

they are mine  i am turning in my running shoes to you
pretty good speech maggie
you are a goddess
i did not even need to change this gasket just put in a little hydraulic fluid
hold on  nobody interviews maggie in here unless they are getting haircut
it is probably because you got him fired
ya think
good morning to you too  you look good
but you have not lost your mystery you are very mysterious
no  i am weird  weird and mysterious are two different things
but i am weird
i think you are right  is there anything i can do to make it up to you

i am sure he will not be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him
okay but if i get yelled at i am never gonna listen to this show again
they met at the empire state building only they did not never mind

mary patrick  do you remember the dixie cups
the dixie cups  oh my  i was just a girl  of course  spring is here the sun will shine
hold it  mary patrick you are a pretty cheerful person are not you
what is it mary
jackpot  two buckets
hurry sister
my soul was in danger i would fallen from grace
it is true  i know her
damnation was all i could see
what a shame
but then came an angel who whispered these words
pay attention
sing and the devil will flee
progressive convents  vanity  it sounds awful  it sounds just like this place
mary clarence are you with us
yeah for one second  that was the blend  you have got to listen to each other  be a group
i knew that
of course  i am a nun  four popes now the lord hates a loafer
i do not know  mary lazarus what do you think  they are pretty raw
wet behind the ears
it will be hell
do not look at your feet and i do not want to see anybody counting  make it look easy  again
right right cross with the left spin and turn
hopeless i
van cartier
hey  you re supposed to be the cheerful one  why do i suddenly feel like snow white
come on we are late
what  what time is it
it is after five  we have to bathe
i i brought you something
a cigarette
thanks  so which one are you sister bruce  sister doug
mary robert  i am mary robert
so bob how long have you been in st k's
three years  sister
three years  a rookie
no you do not understand  i do not want to get out  i want to get in
we must do this sacred thing mary robert
of course  we must do it  it is the will of god  what is it
we must get you some experience  we must leave this place
mary clarence
i have to do this  so i can become a nun
who are all these people
i am getting experience
those people are wonderful  why do not we ever see them in church
good point  especially that dude you were with  i would like to see him down front
mary clarence
goddamn it
what was all that  who was that man why would he shoot at us
i do not know some people just do not like nuns  i wish i had a ruler
mary robert i have watched you  you never really sing  you whisper nothing comes out
i do not want to mess anyone up
we are the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit now do your part
it is contraband  do not ask  but i wanted to give you a treat  a sort of thankyou gift
are you leaving us
the council of cardinals  i am so nervous  what if i forget the words
wait this is not the way  who are you
but what do they want  where are we going
mary clarence
i was downhearted
it is true
i was hellbound yes that is what they say satan was waiting
do not you know it
but the lord came to me
what did he say
a convent  they put me in a convent that is the problem  was not there any more room in hell
your name
christy  christy van cartier
enough joking
that is my real name  currently i am a singer  sort of
st anne's
parochial school  akron  st android's
you were unhappy
i was expelled  when i was fifteen
are you talking about me
and all those like you
you mean black people
absolutely not  i mean the wicked  the heedless  and their las vegas concubines
that is a concubine
cool  is there a menu  or buffet
excused  open the cabinet to your left you will find appropriate attire
but look at rites  look at this  i am a nun  i am invisible  i am a penguin
as of now and until you leave you are sister mary clarence
no problem
the vow of obedience
and the vow of chastity
sisters for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence
silence  no talking  all day
as a new member of our order i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast
a what
a fast  to remind us of the poor of those who must endure without enough to eat
no food
is this all the food i get
yes  until breakfast
this shall be your cell mary clarence
my what
you were right the first time  is this like solitary  the cooler  where is the furniture
our lives are simple  we have little need for material possessions
right sure thing  but what about like appliances  like a little color portable  boom box
useless distractions
it is like the stone age  the room time forgot  what about a phone
and whom would you call
oh i do not know satan
your cell is more than adequate
right  so what do we do now  ping pong  row over to the monastery
it is nine pm  pleasant dreams
i got it
deal with it sweet thing  it is important nowadays  you just practice at home with a balloon and a banana
this is a convent not a clinic  we offer moral guidance not hardware
have you been out in those streets  do you know what those kids are up against you should help them
in english
really catching on
i am sorry i am not a weaver
so hi there
mary clarence i have given you every opportunity  to change  to make a decent life for yourself
a decent life  excuse me  as what  a janitor
mary clarence perhaps you are correct
i am
no  no
i was thinking las vegas  get some butts in those seats
out of the question
please let me try  i am begging you
and on such an occasion i feel a completely traditional program will be best
is not that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals
i believe this can be settled by a simple vote
but wait a minute
you sent for me
hey  your prayers have been answered i am leaving  in just a couple of days
i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara  privately  i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible
but  why
okay so i just got things started  but you could build on that  you could keep it going
what are you doing here
you saved my life
i do not think so  what about skydiving a crank call to billy graham
you have evidenced great maturity mary robert  we shall have a serious discussion
what about me reverend mother  i think you were right  i am just a bad influence  sister show biz
perhaps not  perhaps we can all use a little spandex
really  and maybe shorter habits and women priests and sleeping late
from vince  what a guy  doolang doo lang
at least he is not a cop  at least he can afford a decent gift
i used to buyyoustuff  on your birthday   when we were seeing each other
yeah like what  quilted coat hangers that your mother picked out  lottery tickets  a travel iron
he is a businessman
a what when are you qonna wake up
when are you gonna get off my case have you got a search warrant  what do you want  cheap thrills
information baby  i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience
right between the eyes  down and out the guy was gone  i i could not believe it
he did not do you a favor
and if i do not
ten flights
you would lose  you would die  all over the sidewalk  and into the street
all right  i get the picture  i will do it  i will testify
okay here's what i want  i know about this stuff  a fivestar hotel  with room service
okay  no limo
no nothing
what are you gonna do put me in a bag and bury me
i hate you  i totally hate you
nuns eddie  there are nuns here everywhere  it is crawling with 'em
it is a convent  all you have to do is shut up behave yourself and get along
and one bullet  that is all it is gonna take
eddie you have got to get me out of here
like what
keeping our witnesses alive  we hide them but there's a leak in the department and they end up dead
do you hear that  that choir  eddie in here that is what they call music
what would she say
you blew it  big time  she does not want you back
so what am i supposed to do in the meantime
eddie  you scared the hell out of me
what if i was vince  you would be dead right now  what are you doing giving interviews on tv
it was not my fault  they just showed up  it is helping the convent
you are supposed to be hiding out
i really cannot talk about it now  the place is packed  sro  i have got a show to do
jesus look at you   you are glowing
i am
yeah  you look great  i mean it
really  lieutenant
you mean  worried about my testimony
me too
you are not seeing anybody
no  most of the time i am thinking about you  and now you have really changed
i have
i have got to go
just remember  you are a target  do not you think vince has a tv
i have got a show  at st matthew's cathedral  we are singing for the cardinals
eddie  i have got to go back  they will not sing without me  i am deserting them
i think they would understand
what are you doing
i do not know  there's only one way to be absolutely sure
hey girls
hail mary
we could put you into our witness protection program
then one day they find you
vince is getting desperate  where is she eddie  where would you stash her
where is who
you will not even tell us
we are looking for mike
i am sorry  i do not know what gets into him
who are you guys
but you did not tell me
we did not tell you what
a nun
and if she runs
he is so damn cocky  this is different
it is done
not totally
it did not work vince
get her
there she is
i cannot see anything in here
but boss  she is still you know a nun
so that guy in the bar was right  she is like some kind of nun
she is getting away
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car
you did not shoot
neither did you
i figured if you were gonna then i would not have to
strip down a nun  you want us to fry
a sweater
that is she doing
are you going to shoot us all tough guy
it should be here any minute
we sound terrible   we need mary clarence
look what she did with the choir  she made us sing beautifully
we have got to save her
yes mary patrick
mary clarence  how is your weaving progressing
she should not have come back  she knew she was in danger
she told us about one  the little sisters of the moonlight  in las vegas
peace on earth
is this like your old convent
mary clarence has a background in music that is what reverend mother said
we did it  we actually sang a chord
he is not like other guys
he is decent
i would rather sing than do anything
it is better than ice cream
but reverend mother  everyone loves our new style
ice cream
mary clarence  sister
we cannot sing without her  what should we do
you mean  they kidnapped her
an entertainer
well i do not care who she is  we cannot sing without her
it is so beautiful
the little sisters of the moonlight
excuse me  has anyone seen a nun
i do not understand  where is she
calm down  think clearly  mary robert do you have any idea who those men were
she said they were from her old convent
las vegas  she is here somewhere
absolutely not  i am very sorry but no
but she is been exposed to the underside of life  she is the underside of life
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation
but bishop
st katherine's is a benedictine order you have taken a vow of hospitality  to all in need
i lied
i mean will not she talk she seemed kind of upset
soon you gorgeous thing tell me how lonely
it is that call you were expecting vince
she is she is a nun
we both missed
if we could speak alone
excuse me gentlemen but who has seen this horseman
many have
who took the meat
must have been the redman  a lenape indian lives in the western woods
hail constable  how are you
clergyman steenwyck is calling a meeting  this time he is determined to have you forced out or worse
certainly not
we have not heard your name yet friend
what the hell are you doing
you are the blacksmith  ever shod a horse with a hoof this large
they spend two days in chains
constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side
i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing
you must have missed your mark
excuse me
i say is there any one person suspect in these acts
why did you move the body doctor
no bleeding
we must be a curious sight to him
what are you spying on
he is a behemoth
keep still constable  you were halfdrowned when they found you
 brom bones
he is dead  you would be also if your wound had not somehow shut
bring young masbath here
you need to sleep
bring him
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves
 help yourself you pompous ass i will be in bed
stains of blood
why not tell us what you have heard hmm  how much have your superiors bothered to tell you
all i know is three are slain their heads found severed from their bodies
it is sacrilege
i will not allow it  i will not
protest to my superiors if you like
your superiors are two days away
for poaching  or would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost
no  you will not run me out  no one will believe a word of what you say
oh  far as i can tell a rumor does not travel alone for long here
are you a deist  is that it  a free thinker who does not believe in divinity
it is only important what you are an adulterer
i am the lord's voice in this town
wallowing in sin and lust
they need guidance
wallowing quite literally in blood
damn you sir  god damn you to hell
you are so upset now and yet you seemed in such good spirits last night
taken  taken by the headless horseman  taken back to hell
do you have these persons' wills
i have everything last testaments birth certificates death certificates deeds
may i see them master hardenbrook
hmm  see them
may we look at them now
maybe you should take this
damn damn damn
perhaps i could assist in finding them
just a moment if i may  it is possible this man was murdered
he drowned  anyone could see
he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health
i could determine if he were dead ubeforeu he went into the hudson
have they nothing to fear presently
without disrespect look around you  we overflow  as do our courts
and uwithu disrespect constable if jails and courts overflow it is testimony to success not failure
very few if any
even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused often quite literally
for one who calls himself a federalist your mouth reeks of republican liberalism
chosen me
these methods of yours there has been no practical application
i shall gladly
more than enough actually  i beg you no more please
tell me something  what becomes of young masbath
the widow windsor
is that all you say  look at her
well constable are you aware to be honest you are not what we expected  we sent for the militia
and now jonathan masbath
why would he flee this direction with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover
listen to what you say
no you listen  you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards
i am not here for revenge  i am here to bring justice
whatever  you still need a second to tend to your things
what is the common thread between these victims
i am sure i do not know
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth
out there  what do you see
the western woods
are you familiar with magnets
what kind of nuts
it is spectacular
yes i suppose it is  keep it
no i could not
thank you
if the western woods are truly the devil's glen we will see for ourselves
father said witches live there
i hear nothing
we are leaving
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies  to the tree of the dead  maybe we passed it by
we should not go much further in this murk
well i am one of the few people who likes you
true enough
then who murdered the old crone  and why
what is it
must be some sort of gateway  but why this place 
we should go
someone left last night  looked like they headed to the square but i lost them in the forest
man or woman
all i saw was their lantern
my father had farm land  it was the only thing we owned of any value
only the heirs were killed  proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment
but if the farm is not mine who stole it away
no one yet far as i can tell  it has gone intestate
in test what
intestate  your farm all the farms they belong to no one
baltus van tassel
did your father take a loan
there is no masbath here  my father's loan papers are missing
i was getting worried  who was it
lady van tassel
what was she doing
something i really wish i had not seen never mind it  did you find the victims' loan agreements
there are no other doors  this is as far as she could have gone
it is nothing  she comes to read books so her father will not find her  it is absolutely nothing
what books
fiction plays and novels  baltus does not approve  now come  it may not be long before lady van tassel returns
she is the one who controlled the horseman is not she sir  sir 
will not you change your mind sir what can i say to convince you
why why are you like this
this is farewell
climb up
lady van tassel
what can we do
what now
forgive me i did not know
do you often make a habit of sitting on strange mengs beds
you are horribly oldfashioned are not you
excuse me i should apologize  i um i have no great love of
other people
small talk
is it me or are you this nervous around all women
perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat
my suitor
the massive fellow brom  for someone you call friend he misplaces a good portion of jealousy
he has proposed to me twice
are you so superstitious
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic but not all magic is black
poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions
you do not disturb me  please stay having trouble sleeping
these scars  how did you get them
i have had them since childhood  i cannot remember what from
he only appears to be inside the cage  the point being
oh you are hopeless  may i keep it at least
if you want  but
thank you  no  here
i insist that you have it
very well  but it will only sit gathering dust
you promised justice
if these are the random stalkings of a monster what good am i
people have put their trust in you
they have done nothing of the sort
why would you do such a thing
no stone may be left unturned  it may appear harsh
and this gives worth to butchery
it was not butchery
what is it then  scientific method how can any of this matter in the slightest
to avenge his father and the others
allow me some time  i have spent every hour in the company of others i need to be alone
the things i said to you before i was wrong to say them
no actually you were not  every word you spoke had truth in it
she is not your birth mother is she
no but why do you ask that
what happened to your mother  is she still alive
if you want me to go i will  do you want me to leave
it is only me
katrina  why do you follow
i apologize if i worried you
what are you doing
my god what has happened
why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside
the skull is gone
what what are you doing 
what is so urgent
and what did he say
he did not do these things  if you knew him you would realize
what did he say katrina
yes i have seen that and i told you why i hid them
what would you have me believe
if you think i am behind this say it
the name van tassel is blackened  you share that name
where are we going
the church
what was that
quickly close it
the blades will carry us to the ground face front and wait for me
i i cannot do this
returning to the western woods
yes actually
use caution
excuse me lady van tassel katrina is not in her room
it appears well  it has already clotted
look closer  do you have anything to clean it with
you cannot kill what is already dead
let her go
van ripper  can you show where the body lay
here in front of this oak facing north  horrible
there was not much blood was there
van ripper turn the coach about
what did you say
van ripper do you have a gun
pardon  you did not answer when i knocked  are we intruding
you are from the hollow
i hear him  he rides to the hollow and back
what what are you doing
lay still ichabod  do not move
you you are alive
he rides tonight
no one will believe your lies whore
go home
may i see my mother
you do not want to be here  go home to your father
she did not do it please listen
she is guilty
no sir please she is innocent
no at least i do not think i am
good then may i have the honor of extending an invitation to you
and that is the occasion of this celebration
it is my birthday
and what are you his chaperone
will that be cash or charge
better make it charge 
i thought i recognized you you are paul benjamin the writer are not you
i confess
so your mother grew up in shanghai
until she was twelve she moved here in 'fortynine
and the bookstore have you been working there long
it is just a summer job something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation
your dissertation what subject do you study
american literature what else
what else of course what else and what are you writing about for your thesis
visions of utopia in nineteenthcentury american fiction
melville huh  it is been a while
that is the subject of my last chapter
not an easy book
jesus what happened to you
it looks worse than it is i am okay
what happened
i will tell you all about it   but not here
it is been a while i thought maybe you would be in touch
yeah well i have sort of been out of commission  how is melville
i finished my story i thought you might want to take a look at it
i would love to
good i hope you like it it was a long time in coming
i get off for lunch in ten minutes can i treat you to a hamburger
uh  actually it might be better if you read the story first call me when you are finished okay
okay i will read it tonight and call you tomorrow  it does not seem to be too long
what will it be auggie
what about for you
for me  i will have the same thing 
do me a favor will you
that is the difference
hey auggie how is it going
hey man good to see you what will it be today
definitely  i suppose it all goes back to queen elizabeth
the queen of england
seven eightyfive out of twenty  take care of yourself now and do not do anything i would not do
are you closed
you run out of schimmelpennincks
do you think i could buy some before you leave
looks like someone forgot a camera
yeah i did
it is yours
it is mine all right i have owned that little sucker for a long time
so you are not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter
that is what people see but that ai not necessarily what i am
how would you get started
taking pictures  it is a long story i would need two or three drinks to get through that one
i have never seen anything like it
it is kind of overwhelming
you will never get it if you do not slow down my friend
what do you mean
i mean you are going too fast you are hardly even looking at the pictures
hey man good to see you
so what brings you to a dive like this
it is his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little
help hmm it is possible what did you have in mind
he is got something to tell you auggie
do not be an ass auggie he is trying to make it up to you cannot you see that
he is crazy
no he is not you are
it could have been worse if the cops had not come i might not be standing here now
you have not heard from rashid have you
that could be a good sign though it could mean that he got away
nice machine auggie where would you find it
hey man how is it going
two right
uh better make it one
you usually get two
christmas stories sure i know a ton of 'em
it does not have to be true it just has to be good
i have to pee  if the waiter comes order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale okay
so are we ready
ready any time you are
she probably died
yeah probably
which means that she spent her last christmas with you
i guess so i never thought of it that way
anything for art eh paul
i would not say that but at least you have put the camera to good use
and now you have got your christmas story do not you
what do you mean
i mean it is a good story
shit if you cannot share your secrets with your friends what kind of friend are you
christ ruby it is been so long i figured you were dead
eighteen and a half years
is that all i thought it was about three hundred
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook
you always were a sonofabitch were not you a little weasel with a quick dirty mouth
talk away lady of my dreams i am all ears
all right sugar that is on your mind
do not look at me like that auggie it gives me the creeps
stop it already just stop all this crap right now  was that your idea to call her felicity
it means happiness
i know what it means that still do not make it a good name
i do not know who else to turn to auggie
you did not write to me for more than a year what was i supposed to think
a couple of moments i will grant you that a second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity
and that is how felicity came into the picture during one of those two seconds
good old frank and how is fat mr grease monkey these days
get in auggie i have got something to show you
where to
i told her she was going to meet her father
you what
it was the only way auggie otherwise she was not going to let me see her
yeah like what
that i was not bullshitting you sweetheart at least you will know i have been telling the truth
look i am not saying you do not have a daughter it is just that she is not my daughter
wait till you see her auggie
and that is that supposed to mean
she looks just like you
jesus christ this is all i need
so you are just going to give up and go home
i do not have much choice do i it is pretty clear she does not want me around
she is just a kid there's time for more babies later after she grows up
dream on auggie she will be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday
remember that business venture i was telling you about well my tugboat came in i am flush
bully for you

ruby mcnutt my one true love
enjoy it while you can vin pretty soon they are going to legislate us out of business anyway
they catch you smoking tobacco they will stand you up against a wall and shoot you

and you told your nephew about it
you going to sit here all day
i do not know i have not decided yet
it will cost you five bucks
it was just a thought
i am afraid we will be working on a strictly freelance basis
five dollars an hour  i will take it
the name is cyrus cole
you named the kid after yourself huh
it is only temporary on a freelance basis
and this one in case you have not guessed is junior
hi there little brother

i cannot believe i did that  christ i am walking around in a fog 
no harm done everything's okay now  i have got to be going
no wait you cannot just walk off  you saved my life
i just happened to be there  the right place at the right time
i owe you something
well if you put it that way
you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance
that is all right if i think of something i will send my butler over to tell you
good lemonade it is  i am paul
that is okay i have already had lunch
you must eat lunch pretty early it is only eleven o'clock
i mean breakfast
yeah sure and i bet you had lobster last night along with two bottles of champagne

you do not have to tell me if you do not want to but i might be able to help
oh no momsie and popsie have oodles
and where do momsie and popsie live
east seventyfourth street
in manhattan
of course where else
then what are you doing in park slope it is a little far from home is not it
that is where the what comes in
here and there around
uhhuh one of those cozy bed and breakfast places probably
yeah that is right
people do not do that kind of thing not in new york
i am not people i am just me and i do whatever i goddamn want to do got it
i can take care of myself do not worry
that is it just the two rooms
nice drawing did you do that
my father did believe it or not that little baby is me
yeah i can believe it
it is strange though is not it looking at yourself before you knew who you were
is your father an artist
no he was a schoolteacher but he liked to dabble
drawing's a good thing
is that what you do draw pictures
jesus do you make a lot of noise cannot you see i am trying to work
i am sorry they just they just slipped out of my hands
how long have you been here
three nights
and how long did i tell you you could stay
two or three nights
no hard feelings okay it is a small place and i cannot get my work done with you around
you do not have to apologize  the coast is probably clear now anyway
are you going to be all right
absolutely the world is my oyster  whatever that means 
do you need some money some extra clothes
not a penny not a stitch i am cool man 
hey it is you
i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation
appreciation for what
i do not know for helping me out
where the hell do you think you are going
business appointment i am seeing my broker at three o'clock
cut it out will you just cut it out and come back here
you do not really want to know
why do not you go to the police
you are joking right i mean that is your way of trying to be funny right
if they put this creeper in jail then you would be safe
maybe or maybe it is the other people who do not belong
ah coffee smells good
what time did you get to bed last night
i do not know two or three it was pretty late
just so you do not overdo it you do not want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish
if i tell you i might not be able to finish it
the inspiration
yeah right the inspiration it is a true story anyway so i do not suppose it can hurt can it
hey hey happy birthday why did not you tell me
i just did
here we are  rembrandt's drawings edward hopper van gogh's letters
uh actually i tend to shy away from that kind of thing
i do not know
is it yours
yeah it might be
so you are saying it was not like that at all
not exactly i mean there was more to it than i told you
christ you did not just see what happened they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up
yeah i picked it up
and started to run
and started to run
good thinking
six thousand dollars five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars to be exact
so you robbed the robbers and now the robbers are after you
no way there's no way i am giving that money back it is my money now
a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you
so you lost the job is that what you are telling me he just up and fired you
cuban cigars you mean he had some hankypanky going with those guys
i suppose so he never told me about it
i pay auggie and i have got nothing eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city
fuck you too you white sonofabitch
hi kid
wow they sure did a job on you
we came here to deliver some clean laundry
if it does not make any difference why not just say it
like it or not cyrus that is my name cole just like yours
yeah give him another one and i will take a cup of coffee while you are at it
hot coffee or iced coffee
do you have real iced coffee or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes
i will take the iced coffee  you only live once right
how do you want that cooked
yes please
lettuce and tomato
yes please
do not know how long it is take to get a charge
seven acres  i am wondering what you would pay for 'em  just curious is all
oh yeh
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all  it was uhumanu yes  type b positive
but you cannot say with any certainty that the blood was his
no but as i say the type is rare ten percent of caucasian males
and the blood could unotu have belonged to defendant  seeing that his type is o negative
bits of blood and wood  what else would there be
well if the blood got uontou the gaff by crushing a mangs skull
i do not know
i am a hemotologist not a detective
him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land lived in a picker's cabin at first
so the defendant knew the deceased your son even then
but back in '34 japaneseborn could not uownu land  so
carl held it uforu 'em  called it a lease  they make payments every june and december
now defendant's father had also died by that point  where was the defendant  when you sent his family their equity
and when he came home  did he write you about this  or phone perhaps
when your son came back from the war what did he say about all this
that he would keep an eye on miyamoto watch out for him
just three questions  the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500
tried to  defaulted on their payments
second question  what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre
is that your third question
it is
now mister gi
compressed air horn most likely hope to god some man hears you in that fog
you mean miyamoto followed him out there and suckerpunched him
thank you mr gillanders  thank you for coming down in this cold weather
i said 'excited'  not agitated he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed
you wereoverjoyed yourself to hear the news
happy for him  and relieved
we hear how carlpassed away only a few hours later
your husband returned at what seven o'clock
closer to eight
you thought the deceased might break his promise
of course not  we are just not quick to run and boast  in case something went wrong
yes and then what was there to call about  everything was up in the air
we discussed that  and decided not to
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder
so you hid the truth  deliberately
we were afraid  silence seemed better  to come forward seemed like a mistake
question withdrawn you may step down
you are implying th
the best part was that there was a 'this'  to debate the wrongness of
your friends would  your dad would kill me with a machete
my mom  would be the problem
i can just feel my spirits soar
there cannot be any wrong in this ha
my father cannot get our money from the bank  we have a few dol
i could not say anything  i just stood there hating her
i am sorry about your arm  kabuo and i  are very sor
i am married ishmael  it is not right for us to be alone  people will t
did you write that column
i did  but the jury will not s
you do not believe in god anymore
they only arrested that poor soul because he is japanese
your father fought at belleau wood it took him years to get over it  nightmares tears b
they were japaneseamerican boys yes sir
and you were generally experienced in training men for handtohand combat
well what then sergeant
and you were not there when the coroner examined the wound
so noimmediate suspicion nogeneral talk of enmity between the two
comes off third cleat from the stern port side  and it is brand new  unlike the rest
and replaced it later with the new one  that is your inference
so when the sheriff returned you showed him the injury to the deceased's head
could you tell me what 'kendo' is
objection asking the witness to speculate
objection  asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind
your honor uallu of this is speculation  including mr hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call
maybe it went  where carl went over the side
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork  what is your expertise sir are you a detective of sorts
then putting them together  so truth is revealed
but is not the utruthu that there are useveralu other ways to explain ueachu of these twelve pieces
your line of work  you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth
i asked you a question you are writing a tract h
that is curious  i was uappealingu to their intelligence
uwereu you sir  can you uproveu one word of all your fancy story
robbed  he was angry
mr jurgensen  did he offer to ubuyu the seven acres from you
as my wife testified we were considering it
yes  initially
i should have told everything right away  i know that now and i regret it
my apologies  do you regret not telling the truth
i have told the truth
you have the night watch  on the radio
and you keep the records or contribute to 'em
how long you have this detail
you mean early morning the 16th
they got transferred that day out to cape flattery
i did  boy
you said three minutes
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place
here now what are you fixing to do
you gonna climb that with one arm
it is on the twine too  but it is not r
it is the way it happened i know it is
this tastes horrible hmmn
your daddy  was quite a feller
well why does it
still lashed to the mast
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there  so he climbs up  to cut it down
but you ucouldu be wrong  he ucouldu have climbed up earlier
then where is the lantern  and where is the knife
still a coincidence  timing and all
still and all  carl was a strong swimmer he m
if i whistle  those boys will see you and come running  uyou areu the story today
you ever been strangled by a single hand
we do not let go you s
what for sheriff
you always run with the well open
see you replaced a mooring line lately  this one's new
naw i had that around for a while
you gaff with the uhooku end blood's on the butt  where your hand goes
sheriff i cannot afford not to fish toni
what makes you think i play
white or black
you must think i like losing
bet there's a few things you could teach me  kendo for one
you would not even see it move
now this jury is gonna be looking at the evidence with one eye and at you with the oth
so every time you think about showing that jury strength  or honor or composure  or dignity
you want me to say that
maybe the assailant straightened the cabin  and forgot the cup
i think you testified uallu the lights were on  cabin mast net lights picking lights
did not think about it at the time so no it did not strike me odd
does it now
a little  yes  you have to wonder
but he had a spare d6 you said right there  why not use that
sheriff how many batteries and what size did you find on udefendant'su boat
two d6's  that is the kind his well was fitted for
i believe so
i do not think so
you do not  uthinku so
he was heavy but we were real careful  but i do not remember him hitting anything anywhere
how uisu your motherinlaw
she is alright nels thanks for asking
and her farmhouse
one d6 and one d8 in the well and a dead d8 on the deck
which you inferred was replaced by the d6 which must have been a spare
so thisfoam you found in the lungs  how does it get there
that is uwhyu the autopsy report identifies udrowningu as the cause of death
if the head was moving fast enough but i do not see how it could be
is it possible
sure anything's poss
is it fair to say that you do not know for ucertainu which it was
i already said that b
for certain no
but you are ucertainu that he died by drowning
are you absol
so your husband said he is think it over  encouraged mr miyamoto to believe he might sell to h
i would not say encouraged
well he did not say 'no' did he did not say no hope existed
not in those words
carl never lied
those  wouldirty looks'  defendant ever aim one of those at you
he had no reason to
carl ever say uheu got one
i cannot speak for him
sorry about that mrs heine shall i repeat the ques
the question is more about the udefendant'su attitu

uh that is an affirmative roger wilco  please proceed
we have the codes here  how do you want to receive them
mac can you hear me  come in
that is me
break it down to me that is going on

oh you will get it believe me  so i will see you in a few
it is time we lock coordinates
so what are we waiting for
cool your jetsi am doing a little damage control
you are not helping my heart condition any barnes  now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for
this ship is going down in a blaze of glory
well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation
i told you i had to teach a few people a lesson
goddamn it barnes this really steams my onions
is that clear
that is clear
good  now you will hear from me when i have the new coordinates in the meantime do not bug me
sheesh  aye aye cap'n
look at thisjesus
yeah i guess money do not buy class
no  but it buys a lot of other things
well more power to you  me i start to bug out after too much time out here
that is the usewe are gonna die
we are going to die
it is getting hard to breathe
oh right right you are on that research grant
that is right
ryan taylor first mate  welcome aboard  first time in space
yes  theoretical discoveries aside there's nothing like the real thing how about you
well i hope i do not do anything careless
i am sure you will be all right
what are we going to do
we do not
given a malfunction how would a rescue team get you out if the doors will not open
probably come through the wall i suppose
okit is open
seen one like it before
damn it  if only we could get to those suits dawn then thinks of something 
why cannot we
and suppose you could not hold out
we could send mac  if he can retrieve one suit we could go back for the other
he certainly is polite
it must be oxygenated if we can hear him
if i could get to the bridge i could send the distress signal
i cannot let you do that
look i know what i am doing i have experience and training in space walking
i do not know what we are facing
are you ready
yeah  we did it
you are ready for the real thing
be careful you do not want to puncture the suit
well dawn i am an optimist by nature
do not worry about what will happen just concentrate on what is happening  you will live longer
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude  you saved my life
oh my god  what happened
that is that
a schematic of the ship  looking for a lifeline to the pods
take this flare
a little dab will do ya now you know how to get there right
i am not going with you
and what are you going to do
i am going to try and buy you some time  i can get to the bridge from here
but how are you going to escape
do not worry about me  there's still a chance i can issue a distress signal
but you cannot be sure  it is suicide  you have to come with us
i will once i get past the bulkhead  good luck
dawn  come in
he is out of the equation  talk to me
i am about to blow the wall
hurry  you have to get them out of there
i will do my best
so that is going to happen to you
i am staying with the ship  i will be all right  now hurry
thanks for everything taylor will i see you again
hopefully sooner than later
sooner than later
what the hell are you doing
we have room  let's go
what do you mean  what happened
so close
i never thought this would happen  no premonitions nothing
it did  it is  there's nothing we can do about that
will you marry me
marry you
i would but no one can perform the ceremony  i guess it does not matter
in that case i accept
right now it is about 8 o'clock at home  people are going to work kids are going to school
what is it
i am fine
congratulations on yourrecent award
thank you
is there anything i can help you with
no just enjoying the view
well there's no better to way to see the world than with us
yes mac but the guests are requesting it  it will reduce the level of negative feedback
what is happening around here
there's no time to explain  get everyone together  we found a way to the pods
where is taylor
i am going back for taylor
i am homesick
homesick  it is only been two days
i guess so
oh noi think there's carrots in here
well now what are we gonna do
how am i supposed to know
you are delbert miles  you have more clout than some whacked out pilot  talk to him
it is getting too cold in here  i cannot stand this anymore
look  we are talking about life and death here  i do not know why we are even having this conversation
i have not quite made up my mind yet
again with the orders from you you got a napoleon complex chief and i am getting sick of it
because taylor would not do that that is why
what the hell is that
officer taylor how are you this evening
mac i have a favor to ask you mac looks at taylor 
certainly  if you need anything please feel free to ask me  just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 
yes i know all that  mac i need you to help us out with a little technical problem
certainly  i have a full working knowledge of the ships operations
i need you to actually do something for me  i need to access your cpu directly
that will not be necessary  you can simply speak to me  i understand most languages fluently
yeah but the ship's mainframe does not i need you to tell it something
alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer
now mac can you tell me the status of this deck
but the corridor outside this door is open correct
how is it looking mac

we are a habitat  not a castle  the only defense we have is high voltage
high voltage
it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface  but we have never used it underwater before
forty yards
but you have tested it
sure  each time it started fires inside the habitat
thirty yards
where is it
what was that
increase positive pressure
that is our reserve air
do not do it norman
do not pull it norman  it will start a ufireu we cannot stop  norman
do it norman it is the only choice we have  this thing is gonna crush us
norman please  do not
well thanks for the opportuninty here  my wife appreciates it
do not thank me dr johnson  you were not my choice  the pentagon made me take you
come with me  the team's already waiting
what have you been told so far
the usual  plane crash  survivers unknown  routine stuff really
anything else
you talk to any reporters  any press
good  security's been our biggest worry  now that you are here we can shut this thing down tight
from what  that is with all the security
we are moving fast considering the storm
storm  what storm
a cyclone's on it is way in  i thought they would have told you on the phone
how deep is he
survivors  no i would not think so
what is it  a military spacecraft like a shuttle or satellite
coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year 
 wait a second 
 dating the crash at least that old
hold on 
extraordinary is not it
it is impossible
off the record i do not mind telling you this thing scares the shit out of me
what team
the one you recommended  in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration
they pressurize us with helium
what is it norman
picked up something  what is it
like thou shall not kill
or maybe it cannot ubeu killed
you mean that is in that thing is immortal
i do not know  that is the point
do not get hysterical norman
all i am saying is someone should keep an eye on him
harry's missing
what do you mean he is missing
he is missing  he is gone  he left
you cannot just leave harry down here sir
i told you people nobody goes anywhere unless i say
i am not paranoid  i know beth  she can be drastic
how drastic
you do not want to know
she should have known better
she put a razor to her wrists a day later
when was this
'81 i think  she tried again five years ago  i thought you should know
you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation 
wait a second 
 and then brought her down here 
great okay  ask him about his weapons
that is smart  let's talk about guns and violence
you do not think weapons are important
because if jerry is powerful and also emotional
damn it edmunds
 it raises a very serious question uwhat happens if jerryu ugets madu
what for
if something should happen to us the navy will at least have partial records of what happened
you think he killed edmunds
yes i do  whatever's out there i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier
bullshit  that is out there is not alien  it is an animal
maybe so  but i think we need to ask jerry about it
what the hell  it shut us down
jerry  please  stop this
yes sir  i am here
i see it
can you open that panel
it is not sucking sir
thank you i can see that  try something else
we do not have anything else to try sir
what caused it
get him out of there  i thought i told you people 
subs are still at surface sir
i am getting no sub reading sir
any sign of harry
nothing sir
nothing sir
yes sir
well where the fuck is he
sir if the subs have not left by now
they have left keep watching
norman get out of there now norman
edmunds get in here  i need you for this
how much damage
to the craft  none  not a scratch
it is chipped
chipped  the door  how can it be chipped
i do not know how it can be chipped but it is chipped
i thought you said there was not any damage done in the crash
i did
ted  captain
yes harry
we know how this craft got here where it is been
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere
so how do we get it open
so  that is the problem
or it could contain some great benefit to us some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind
it could  but the odds of it being any use to us are against it
gimme a report i want 
ladies and gentlemen
who is that  where is that coming from
it is a single sequence repeated over and over
that is the message
i have to tell you  it is strange
ignorant  the thing's ignorant
are you enjoying yourself harry because i do not know what the hell you are doing
not now beth  please  i want to know who we are talking to before we start talking  where is edmunds
he is saying take me to your leader he wants to know who's in charge
with an o  harold with an o
edmunds  get in here  i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted
she is not gonna know
she wired this system
a half a mile long
i would also like it noted 
what uaboutu a crowbar
ted get her away from the door
look at this
some sort of lead or something
radiation shield you think
that is wrong
we had considered it
time travel  i always thought it was one of those myths like santa's reindeer
what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back
but what does it do  this sphere
can i stay sir  i am willing to risk it  i am  after what we just witnessed
did you hear me sir because 
how can he be missing
sir about leaving 
they switched us over
to what
she says jellyfish are a delicacy you know i never knew that
from the sphere
i want a name  a real name  this thing's full name rank and serial number
it is not talking it is mimicking
what is that
it will not register  it is too big to image
well until we know exactly what it is nobody goes outside understood
what was edmunds doing outside
resetting the sub
beth look can i trust you with a little secret
i love secrets
that ulf report everybody's patting me on the back about
i have read it twice norman  it is brilliant
it is bullshit  the report's a joke
do yourself a favor norman  are you listening  do not tell anyone what you just told me
c'mon beth  that report's like the blind leading the blind
because when we get down there 
wait  down where
it never occurred to me
well let's pray that is the only mistake you made  have you said anything to barnes about this
the timing has never seemed quite right
just keep your mouth shut alright this could mean everything to our careers you know that  do not jeopardize this
is not there a psychological term for that dr johnson
you are next norman
no  go ahead  really  ladies first
400 years ago  i am sure christopher columbus would have loved these accomodations
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas
where would this come from
the library
we have a library
a bad one  it was the only book in there  norman come here look at this
my gosh norman
yeah it was awful
what do you mean  not normal
they have six tentacles  a new species  and the squid too  they had no stomach
you knew about the squid not being normal  before fletcher went out there
yeah why
i mean i am not i was not absolutely sure if they 
they are or they are not  which is it
i cannot feel her bones  she is like a sponge
she was crushed  feel her skin  it is like sandpaper
 he lied to us  he left us down here
so what
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute  nobody
you are jumping to conclusions beth do not get worked up 
where did you get this
in edmunds' things
you went through edmunds' things
he is not just a navy captain  he works for the fucking pentagon
calm down beth  alright
do not tell me to calm down
you did did not you
do not do this
you bastard
where are you going in such a hurry
forget the sub
do not bother me norman
you me and harry
you me and harry  he is asleep
four days
maybe you should go  to the sub
why should i go
you should know how it works  just in case
in case you die too
i do not trust harry to do it
i would  but my suit 
you fixed my suit
you do not trust me
the sub's a 100 feet in front of you  you see it
i cannot see anything  how does it look  still clear
that is the matter
you fixed this suit  beth
yes norman  i did  you are just nervous
my air is not i am coming back
still clear
 what do you mean  i am in the ship
what are you doing in the ship  beth
getting food  we were out of food that is wrong  you sound mad
yeah well i get that way when i am facing death and someone deserts me
deserts you  harry said he would take over for me
you get it straightened out
that is harry doing with your suit in there
fixing it
fixing it  but i fixed   where would you get all that
the refridgerator
the refridgerator
it is a pretty common place to look for food when you do not think you have any
that was not in there before
we must have had it delivered then
wait a second 
1800deepsea delivery  i hear they are good
none of this was here before
you think
you do not believe me
all i know is i opened that refridgerator 
damn it norman  i swear  i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit
you think it is me  you think i am saying there was a conversation when there was not
what do you mean a part of harry
when did the messages start  the animals outside start showing up after harry came out of the sphere
you think in the sphere 
he acquired some sort of power  a power to manifest things
but how
i do not know
which i told barnes was attacking 
it is his fear  the squid  he is manifesting his fears  making them real
but why is he doing it
he must not realize he is  like the navy crewman  harry was sleeping then  he must have manifested his dream
and that is the part of harry that is being manifested
looks like some sort of code
diphenyl parlene
something for burns
a synthetic opium analogue
does it cause drowsiness  that is all we need  to get him unconscious  put him under
antihistamine  for bites
it is a soporific
that is that
causes sleep
it is like a sleeping pill
how long does it last
three to six hours
i will just boost the doses
what  wait  is not that dangerous
how fast does it take effect
to be on the safe side  i mean 
you want to kill him
you ever given an injection before
thirty years ago  in residency  i passed out  you
i am sorry
for what
what is it norman
where are you
the sphere looks different
what do you mean different
the grooves around the door  they have shifted  and the pattern  the fluids  they look darker now
what was that  i could not hear you
your watch
that is wrong norman
i am feeling better
it is getting cold
you think i would really drink that
you do not think i put something in it do you
you put explosives around the habitat i cannot imagine what you would put in a drink
how do you feel about snakes
snakes  what do you mean exactly
what are they doing down here  in the bathroom  suddenly appearing
you tell me
do you fear them
do not you
are you manifesting them
if i was then i would have had to have gone in the sphere would not i
did you
that is the phrase  keeping up with the joneses
why did you go in the sphere beth
same reason i put explosives around the habitat  for defense  for the power  to protect myself
against what  harry's unconscious he is not a threat
no he is not
he cannot manifest
no he cannot
then why beth  why go in  why put out explosives  why manifest the snakes
you think i manifested the snakes
someone did
beth you are losing it  c'mon
c'mon  what
that is when you went in the sphere
one lonely terrifying sea snake
you are insane
am i  or am i making so much sense that you are going insane
that is bullshit
is it
do not beth
but i have to norman
i promise 
do not beth  please
this is what i am talking about norman  do not you see  it is in you this vindictiveness  this rage
do not fuck with me beth
where is it coming from beth
beth stop it
then where is it coming from
stop it
you cannot stop it norman  you cannot fight me
i know  you are too strong beth
do not tell me about me  i already know too much
beth  gimme the gun
top shelf is it
you hear that
hear what
would it work
yes  and i think we already know it will
no  i do not think so
well think  because there's footprints here that are not mine
i do not get it
well that is your theory
norman  where is norman
he does not wait for an answer
pry the thing open  what are we  neanderthals
all that banging and pounding  i do not know  we should think about making a good first impression
for who  the fish
it is empty  why would someone build a ship like this
then what is it
what are you looking for
when he woke up he said we were out of food  he told me to get some from the ship
i never said that
yes you did  norman i would not leave you out there  you know that
we never even had a conversation norman
jerry  right  i said jerry did not i
that is a hell of a mistake to make beth
i am sorry  slip of the tongue
just in time too
our habitat i mean  this place cannot handle another attack
why are you looking at me like that
like what  i am not 
you are staring at me
no i am not  i am not star
they are going to want answers and they are going to keep asking until they get them
we can refuse to talk
when did it come across
minutes ago  harry's trying to decode it in his room now
where is it coming from
no idea  we have no surface support it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater
you holding up alright
fine  i am fine
do not be defensive
i am not being defensive
you sound defensive
go ahead  ladies first
c'mon norman
nice work norman
our answer
to what
this answers one of our questions
but on the way home they miss their turn go too far into the past
do not be so optomistic harry
i am completely serious  there is something very important missing from that spacecraft  you know what that is
not a clue
a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible
meaning we are never gonna get the chance to tell anyone
i cannot believe that harry
i cannot  if i had a minute to think maybe but i know you are wrong
am i
look  we are under a lot of pressure we are tired you are not thinking straight
you mean you think i am cracking
no  i did not say that
what is that  that noise
what noise
harry can you tell me about the sphere
what are you still doing here
you remember opening the door
you were all supposed to leave  you were not supposed to stay down here
tell me about the door  do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere harry
you do not understand about the sphere
what is it harry
what happens on page 87  have you ever read page 87
page 87 of what harry
i could never read that far  i never wanted to
these are not half bad fletcher  you might have a second career coming
getting anywhere with those
there's some sort of pattern here it will take a minute
have you looked outside  jellyfish everywhere  i hate jellyfish  harry what happened in the cafeteria
do not do this  do not psychoanalyze me  i hate squid  period  just like you hate jellyfish
you said something to me before  about how we were all going to die
did i
norman where are you
i cannot breathe  am i clear
thank you  my suit  beth said she fixed it 
what happened to her
what do you mean  she is not here
when i woke up nobody was here
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me
her suit is gone
beth left
she is cracking norman
you did not say that about the food
i was just in the cafeteria there's plenty of food in there  take a look for yourself
but why would she  
navy transmission  they are sent from wisconsin
how do we decode it
we just figured you know the three of us  we need to work together through this
the three of us
that is right
what is it
it is the squid  stop it
did i kill her
i do not think so
we are never gonna make it
how much time you figure to get to the surface
two and a half minutes  once we are in the sub
i cannot reach her
push her c'mon
hold on
hurry norman  four minutes
three fiftysix three fiftyfive three 
c'mon norman
i am trying to keep balance with 
gimme a second 
just pull her  down like inside  harry work with me here
her legs are in the way
get her out of the seat i need room to sit  harry
you know how to work this thing
no idea
less than a minute we are never gonna make it
nine hundred feet to surface
there is one possibility
the power allows us to manifest our fears right  what if we feared the power to go away
you mean forget
what would you say to him
to who  arthur  nothing  nothing that norman does not already know
what does norman already know
she told me what you said norman
what is it harry
it is just like swimming norman you know how to swim do not you
easy ted we are not mining gold
alot like  you know i noticed it before but i did not
you do not think it does  i think it is rather obvious
but it is impossible
why would this ship carry instructions in english
all the facts you need are right in front of you
gimme a minute here i think i have got it
do you
if it is an alien spacecraft 
meaning it did not land in the water
please  it must have flown here 
it did not fly here  it uarrivedu here
arrived  from where
looks like a design some writing maybe  maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message
hey go easy on the salt will ya we are not a bunch of icy streets here
salt's good for you ted  helps you from getting impotent
well if it is a discharge 
if it is a message it is probably a substitution code  i will work on it
what would you say
good idea ted
norman johnson
does this mean what i think it means
it is over sir the storm has cleared
the ships
how are the others
the others sir
beth and harry
that whole time  i could not stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier
any other bags dr johnson
no other equipment  scientific instruments
no they did not say 
captain barnes wants to see you right away sir
captain who
by the way sir i have read your report  i think it is brilliant
what report
you mean they have not told you yet
i am in psychology  was  still am really just been a while  i treat aircrash survivors
oh so you are that dr johnson
you have heard of me
well everybody's been talking about that report you wrote
what report
you mean you do not know
must be another johnson then  been flying so many scientists out here  cannot keep everyone straight
who's everyone
physicists mathematicians geologists you name it
geologists  at a plane crash
strange is not it  in the middle of the ocean no less
he was not feeling well
you want me to try
strange is not it  you know  how it would have a button
earth does not have a patent on buttons ted
it is not some fucking substitution code it is a direct visual representation
you mean a picture
take a look  i rearranged the numbers  put 'em up to the light  go ahead  squint at it
i do not see anything
squint harder
please ted
try this one
this is like nursery school
do not you see it  it is a picture of the creature
well he is polite
you want to put him on your couch norman  grill him about his childhood
frankly ted i would be much happier if jerry was just a cold emotionless intellect
what was it
barnes did not know  could not get a reading
has harry spoken with jerry
you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds  with that is out there
what kind of a crash was it
you seen my suitcase
there's nothing on the news about a crash  did he say what airline
he did not say much at all  honey 
in the closet  i do not understand norman  why would they call you
do not be so supportive honey
well i cannot imagine five years of unemployment 
four  four years 
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume
keep watching the news  are you watching the news
was it a military crash
i do not know
i am han solo captain of this vessel  who's in charge then
well we will see
well now you know the enemy is on the move  we have not much time
well i have brought you here  what now
well for one reason we do not have your other five thousand
who's going to pay me then
i think there are some things we should talk about
kid you take the glory and the good intentions and i will take the reward
fear is their greatest weapon
you have your father's style  you have done very well
check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures  both of you will have to learn
we are going to get in by studying imperial procedures  i do not like it
i will get the information
 and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments
darth vader is on this system  i can feel him  i can feel the kiber crystal
is that good or bad
we will be back before you are old man
sorry but that was the only way to get you down
i am luke starkiller guardian of the bendu
oh so you are a warrior then
who are you anyway
i do not see why  i do not believe we have ever met
i i am not a bendu officer  i am not even a startrooper
i know that
you saw through me
you could put it that way
you mean i generate an energy field
it surrounds you and radiates from you  a jedi can feel it flowing from him   from here
that is not a human decision not your or mine
do not you have a kiber crystal
i had one but it was taken at the battle of condawn
do the sith know the ways of the force
they use the bogan force
we do not have that kind of money how much do you think i can get for the speeder
this is the last place  should not we just take what we can get and think of something else
but she is a member of the twelve families  how can they hold her
that is wrong  that is happening
what is it
but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases
you mean we should go after her
i cannot see  how can i fight
try to feel it  use the force
i cannot do it  i will get hit
see once you let yourself go you can do it  you will get it
of course where you been kid
that is no battle kid they are just sitting there
at least you are doing something i would give anything to be in your position
you are starkiller
yes sir
blue five does that glare bother you
i am right behind you blue leader
yes sir but i can get him
no reply on any circuits it is drifting on a point twentyseven skew  it is not close enough to identify
alert squad five but hold them until we know what it is
should we alert the sith lords
i will make a report later
as close as we can make out it appears to be a corellian gypsy vessel it is not under power
we do not get many visitors  let's take a look at it
here come six more grid two
there are only three or four left
when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces you get your reward you have my guarantee
where are you taking us now anyway
the fourth moon of yavin  i have given the coordinates to chewbacca
i do not see how we are going to find anything out here  this terrain is hopeless
we must hurry to the base  we have little time before the death star arrives
who's the pilot
you do not believe in the force
i found it it is just not there
well i practice a lot
you are good with  aremotes' but how are you against something living
between his howling and your blasting everything in sight the entire city is going to know we are here
this is not going to work
why did not you say so before
something has happened to them let's try this way
let's try this way  holy maker
i think she is going to be all right
is he afraid of the water
watch it  move back
it is only light that does not affect it  solid things like rocks can hurt it  fire above him
get to the ship
i do not pick up any life form concentration down there  she would better be right
they must be shielded somehow  i am sure the base is there
i noticed you were having some problems blue five i thought i would help
we will send a squad up
no need everything's under control
with four casualties
the ah door's jammed  give us a few minutes to get it fixed
the  wouldeath star' has become operational  there is no force in the universe that can stop us now
they will find its weakness
what is it  that is going on  where are we
i am luke starkiller at your service
are there medical facilities on yavin
first thing tomorrow morning you are going to check those condensing units on the south ridge
that is all right  there is nothing anyone can do about it  you can call me luke
you have been in the counter wars against the empire
what happened  i am sorry sir i must have taken a bad step
i think we are going to need them blast it
sir i have a couple of extra circuits  perhaps they might bring something
let him have it  you are winning anyway  it does not make any difference
level five detention block a23 cell 2187  she is still alive
see threepio do you copy
i read you sir
you are back  what happened  never mind  that is going on
i am afraid we are not plugged in at the moment sir  we have had some problems
are you safe
for the moment  we are in the main hangar  artoo is trying to plug into the system now
holy maker threepio  i forgot
are you there sir  we are going
you got some guts for a rich kid i guess you and me could be buddies
what an honor
what makes you think you will make squad leader rico 
something i have gotyou do not
you rich kids are all the same 
wanting it does not make you the best one for the job
oh yeah  i do not see anyone else here with the chops to lead

i thought 4th brigade cleaned out p
owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago that is why micom wants onsite assessment

rico tell'em to glass this goddam planet i have never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time
this is my farm get on the boat now  that is an order sergeant
who is'v'ger'
v'ger is that which programmed me
why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead
find the creator uwhatu creator uwhoseu  what does v'ger want of the 'creator' 
the creator is that which created v'ger
who is v'ger
the examination is a normal function
the creator has not answered
the carbonunits are not responsible for that
disclose the information
not until v'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet
kirkunit uwhyu do you not disclose information
because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet
they have repressed the creator
then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices
carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise's proper evolvement
what is enterprise's proper evolvement
enterprise would be unable to function uwithoutu carbon units
what does that mean
does v'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units
you said v'ger's purpose was to find and join with the creator
a machine then it had to be programmed by uwhomu
by the creator
'to learn all that is learnable'
and when v'ger melds what will happen to you
departure angle on viewer
it is a courier captain grade one priority nonbelligerency confirmed
deck four captain officers' quarters
sir airlock four has been opened a thruster suit is reported missing
mr chekov when do those devices activate
tractor beam strength lessening captain
i am taking over the center seat i am sorry will
you are what
you will stay aboard as executive officer a temporary grade reduction to commander
may i ask why
my experience  five years out there dealing with unknowns like this  my familiarity with the enterprise this crew
we will have to replace commander sonak i would still like a vulcan there if possible
none available captain there's no one in fact who's fully rated on this design
programming ready
 but i still recommend further simulation study
then you acted properly of course
thank you sir i am sorry i embar rassed you
you saved the ship
i am aware of that sir
stop competing with me decker
i trust you will nursemaid me through these difficulties mister
if our executive officer has no objections
of course not i am aware of mister spock's qualifications
recommend defensive posture captain screens and shields
captain we have seen what their weapons can do should not we take every possible precaution  
i advise caution captain we cannot withstand another attack
how do you define uunwarrantedu umisteru
ucomputer offu
it is taken control of the computer
the ship is under attack man all defensive stations
why bring us inside not to destroy us they could have done that outside
captain that is the next move
well mr decker it seems my bluff is being called
mr decker i will contact you every five minutes otherwise inform mr scott immediately
they may have attacked only as a warning to us captain to keep away
we could have cut it off at the main computer
captain this probe may be a key a key to the aliens
exactly  and you did have a  arelationship' with lieutenant ilia commander
then v'ger believes the creator to be a umachineu too
forward motion captain
that transmitter is a vital link between v'ger and the creator 
i now the captain meant no person al insult
negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sublight speed
navigational deflectors inoperative  directional control also inoperative captain
was he difficult
no more than i expected  not as difficult as this i am sorry
that you left or that you did not say 'goodbye'
lieutenant ilia reporting for duty sir
'commander' decker
and in you too lieutenant
time to impact
twelve seconds
mr spock
transmit mr spock now
thirty seconds to cloud boundary
fifteen seconds to cloud boundary
maneuvering thrusters mister sulu
maneuvering thrusters sir
hold station
ahead warp one mr sulu
mr sulu steady as she goes
reduce magnification factor 4 mr sulu
we are already two settings below that sir
one hundred kilometers
viewer ahead
hold station
clear the bridge captain
admiral i have been hoping to see you maybe you can get through to those thick heads in starfleet that
why are not the enterprise transporters in operation mister scott
we are hoping it is only a temporary problem admiral
admiral the enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign ing and refitting she needs testing a shakedown
we are losing the pattern
reporting as ordered captain
sir i would appreciate dr mccoy absenting himself from this interview
also  there was nothing in your report about uwhyu you are here
i still contain fragments of my human half
and whatever you sensed out here
i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer sir
do unotu return scan mr spock it may be misinterpreted as hostility
captain i suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud
they have they uhaveu been communicating with us i sense  upuzzlementu why have we not replied
it appears that our message has been understood captain
the 'puzzlement' i sensed was fleeting minor   as if carrying a sense of our insignificance captain
we are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality yet they cannot understand who we are or what we want
recommend we proceede captain
no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude
that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earth's sun
captain we have been seized by a tractor beam
we cannot break free captain  we do not have a fraction of the power necessary
they had a pattern to follow
 they may have followed it utoou precisely
spock concerned about his chances
bridge cancel rescue teams  spock what in the hell are you doing out here
i am seeking answers captain
it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information a remarkably efficient system
and these 'sensorswarms' collect that data carry it here
klingons our epsilon 9 station  and ilia they seem to be more than just images
if this is their ship's data banks where is the crew or is their entire ship automated
were you right spock v'ger is a living machine
what should you have known
no meaning no hope  and jim no answers jim it is looking for uanswersu uitselfu
what answers
these read as identical composition   however captain they measure several hundred times more powerful
not for us
has not doctor  and now because of what we are planning will not
captain the orbital device will      not be triggered for twentytwo       minutes                           
the point 
v'ger plans to literally umeldu to reduce both itself and the creator to patterns
spock we uwereu its answer
yes captain it needed our mortality the fear of it our struggle against it our fears our dreams
 and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us
you have received your appointment as enterprise science officer
based i am told on your recommendation admiral thank you
why are not you on board
captain decker requested i complete final science briefing here before
here at starfleet the enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock
to you sir
captain we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors
engineering status mr scott
we are ready sir
transporters room and chief engineer scott report trans porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally sir
dock control reports ready sir
negative helm control captain going reverse on impulse power
starfleet signals sir growing in strength  they  have intruder on their monitors  it is decelerating  powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate
the third one is moving off too  a fourth one is forming
starfleet has been apprised of our situation captain
annabelle sucked her thumb last night

maybe you could back off just a little bit 
what did you do
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking
i am sure that did not upset her everyone in our family takes showers
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards
maybe the problem is your ukidsu  maybe they are spoiled coddled ubratsu
get out

you taught my child that i am some limp dick uloseru  who did not ucareu about her pain
you were not passing 'em out

oh please
you have turned her into you  and i may not get another chance  to turn her back
thanks for coming out
that is this about  because we ufoughtu
i love luke i love the children but there is more to life than even love

at his office in the capitol
if he is not there try  87  43  56
where is thisthing
that is preposterous  we have no such program
the source wasshall we say completely reliable
it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man
bah  all you wanted to do was spy in our country
that is nonsense and you know it
and now mister president i must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the premier
goodbye mister ambassador
excuse me mister president but you forgot to give me my camera back
premier belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie
do not you dare touch me  what the devil do you think you are doing
i caught you redhanded mister ambassador
give that back to me
perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source
you mean you will tell us his name
my seven body orifices
that is right fella
majormajor  i am colonel bat guano 701 battalion
come income in peace on earth peace on earthyes

i think that just might be it  although it could be rikitikitavi
get a grip on yourself major
now snap out of it fella
what happened major  some kind of private beef between the two of you
look i did not shoot him
we will have to leave that up to the cid boys will not we major
look colonel  i have got to talk to somebody at air command
do not worry major  your rights will be fully protected
colonel do not you know that is going on
sure i do  there was some kind of mutiny on the base and you killed general ripper
look general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd bomb wing to attack with hbombs
you must think i am an awful sap major  just sit down fella and keep your hands on the desk
did not they tell you
you have wasted enough of my time fella
wait a minute  the president  that is it the president
what about the president
he wanted to talk to general ripper did not he
so what
i am sorry sir  general schmuck is asleep and he is not taking calls until eightthirty
what is your name young lady
ceida pietraszkiewicz
what did you say
ceida pietraszkiewiczpie traszkiew icz
general schmuck
go back to sleep baby
colonel you are not drunk are you man
no sir
does the threat board show anything
well mister president
general schmuck
to be perfectly honest mister president we really are not sure
just a second sir  he is got films of the war room in that thing
under a condition red alert the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies
well sir they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base
that is a very wise deduction general
under the circumstances general what would you think they should do
welli suppose penetrate the base by force
you see you knew the answer all the time general
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt mister president
what do you suppose is going to happen if general ripper's planes start bombing their targets
i want him upped to brigadier general and recomended for the dsc
combat operations center major mandrake speaking
this is general ripper speaking
yes sir
do you recognize my voice
why do you think i ask
i do not know sir we just spoke a few minutes ago
youddo not think i would ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important do you major
good  has the wing confirmed holding at xpoints
yes sir
all right major  i am putting the base on condition red
condition red
that is right  i want this flashed to all section immediately
a shooting war
yes major  this looks like it is going to be it
let me worry about that major i have still got my red line to the air command
you are right sir
no calls from inside out  no calls from outside in are even answered  no calls
i understand sir  nothing comes or goes without your personal sayso
no calls at all  with or without my sayso my voice can be imitated too major
yes sir  i just thought of something sir  how do i know i am talking to you now
who do you think you are talking to
to you sir  but how do i know
are you trying to be insubordinate
no sir
are you hard of hearing major
are you questioning my orders major
no sir  i am just bringing the facts to your attention sir
you are a good officer major and you are perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention
sort of like a new hobby huh general
oh it is not my radio sir  i picked it up in the communications center
i did not mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either major
yes sir  general can i ask a question
certainly major mandrake  you are a good officer and you can ask me a question any time you want to
well general ripper sir  i was thinking  we are on a condition red are not we
that is correct major
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress does not it
that is a good question major  maybe if you think hard you can think of the answer yourself
well i was thinking maybe an enemy attack is not in progress
but then sir why have you issued the order wing attack planr
suppose that were the case
but  whythat would be an awful thing to do sir
i suppose they are sir
you are damned right they are
how much soda sir
that about right
what shall we drink to sir
general ripper can i ask another question
ask away major
well general  i was wondering why are you doing this  i mean why do you want to start the war
i have given it alot of thought major  do not think i have not
no sir  i mean i did not think you had not given it a lot of thought
do you remember what clemenceau once said about war
i do not think so sir
he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals
well i think i remember reading the report on that  was not it something like a hundred and sixty million
that is close enough major
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people sir
i suppose we might catch them off their guard
our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy would not they
but if you just let things alone we would not lose anyone
major mandrake i guess you do not follow that is going on too closely do you
where sir
well i know they have been going on for years and they have not gotten any place
not yet major  not yet
and i guess they will not until they agree to let us inspect inside their country
you are very naive major  do not they say they want disarmament
yes sir  but so do we
i still ask why do they want disarmament
gee sir that last remark does not exactly make all the sense in the world
major you are talking like one of them
well i am not sir  honestly sir
do not be offended major  our president holds the same views
but if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want we would agree would not we
if they gave us what we think we need yes i guess we would
do you think we would cheat
no sir  i am sure we would not
major those are my boys out there dying
to peace on earth major
it was a honest mistake sir
and i suppose there's some reason why you have not recalled them
yes sir  the base commander general ripper selected planr
how soon until the enemy finds out that is going on
we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twentyfive min utes
general jack d ripper sir
i want to talk to general ripper
i do not think that is a fair analogy sir
we do not operate like you kgb boys
have you received acknowledgements from every plane
they are coming in now
how long will it take to receive them all
i believe it will be just a few minutes at the most
how many planes did we lose
i am not certain mister president  but i believe it was four
general schmuck are you positive of your figures
naturally i am sir
he says they have only shot down three planes
well if you choose to take his word over mine 
look he is there and you are here
mister president there were thirtyfour aircraft involved  thirty acknowledged the recall  that makes four shot down
how do you know they were shot down buck
well sir it looks like one aircraft the leper colony failed to receive the recall
that is the target
you have lied to me twice  i am sorry but it will be strictly routine  these men are experts
yeah to see if we are on our toes
give me a first rough course as soon as you can lieutenant ballmuff
i have got the heading major  onethreeeight
roger maintain
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes
thanks binky  can you see bromdingna island yet
all rightwe are still flying  i am taking her down to the deck
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level
you know what that will do to our fuel consumption
what else could it be
he is right  we would not have started it
they must have clobbered some of our cities already
he is right  they must have clobbered some of our cities already
maximum ecm
i am sorry major kong  i guess i was way out of line
a through h is correct
missiles  sixty miles off heading in fast  steady track they look like beam riders
between mach 3 and 4
call them every five miles
twenty  twelve o' clock
yeah i got it in the thigh
why cannot he help me now  he is sitting two feet away from me
come on quentin is not that pretty selfish putting yourself ahead of the mission
fighters closing fast  range fifty miles
they must have made a visual contact
must be mach twofive stuff  altitude fifteen thousand
they cannot touch us at this height
i think they mean business
sorry king  my leg's stiff as a board
sure i will take her up to eight hundred
could you take her up right now king  other wise we will get kind of close to the fireball
wing attack planr  that is exactly what it says
check your code again  no one at base would pull a stunt like that terry
no this looks like the real thing
lieutenant toejam are you ready for bim and bam
primary arming switch
i thought i should check out the damage first my gear is busted up pretty bad
so am i
listen i think i am hit bad
where would they get you
what does it look like
some kind of signaling
no kidding
yep it is the crm114 code all right
listen king old buddy  on behalf
i have got one
shoot lothar
our targets are a missile complex and an airfield  not cities right
that is what i said
well if there's a war they must have hit us first
are you saying our order do not make sense
check target approach
bomb doors circuit is green bomb release circuit is green bomb fusing circuit is green
check all bomb circuits green  okay lothar
when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary major
primary circuit is live
release first safety
second safety
fusing for ten thousand air burst
master safety
primary bomb is live
all right lothat that does it  master safety on now until bomb run
let's have a rundown on the damage lothar
yes major
lothar get up here fast and bring your first aid kit  i am hit kinda bad i think
cannot ace help you
he is dead
what happened
i bit his jugular vein  now will you shut up and get up here
where would they get you
how do you know he is dead
he is dead all right
i do not know what we got left besides bim and bam
no look  it is ope  recall mistake
recall what mistake
you sure have to hand it to those guys
what do you mean
i mean pulling a stunt like that
what do you mean
well we sure as hell are not going home just because the enemy tells us to
wait a minute major  ope that is the recall code  where would they get that
you tell me
they must have gotten it from the base no one else would know it
why should they call us back
lieutenant zogg what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission
but the crm114 has been smashed for almost an hour
then that settles it does not it
like hell it does
the crm114 is smashed right
right  so how could we get any messages
that is the point
i do not get you king
i said that is the point
look king maybe you have lost too much blood or something
lieutentant zogg how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back
take it easy major kong
nobody's loyalty is beyond question  besides how do we know one of his staff did not see it
we crossed the coast over an hour ago okay
you are giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball
first lesson in war college  never under estimate your enemy
sorry king
who's that
it is me  lothar  are you okay
i am okay  that is up
well i hate to say this but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck
are you sure
well i cannot get out and look king  but i do not get a green light
maybe the warning system's out
but i get a red light
have you tried the emergency system
lothar can you arm the bombs for impact
but i told you i do not think we can get the bomb bay doors open
there's no other way lothar  can you rearm the bombs for impact
let me check
we are on course major  just fixed our position on that river back there
i thought i would go along for the ride
now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for lothar
king would you mind if i keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in
i would be mighty proud if you did lothar
thanks king  i have always wanted to take one of these big babies in
listen lothar  you know that crack i made about yourbutt
forget it
i just wanted you to know i did not mean anything by it

you will pardon me norma why do not you just sit and watch  ok  here we go
roll 'em
well what do you know  joe gillis 
hi artie
where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours
give me your coat
let it ride for a while
you are going to stay are not you
that was the general idea
judas e priest who did you borrow that from adolphe menjou
say you are not really smuggling opium these days  are you
sure this will go on all night
i mean could you put me up for a couple of weeks
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch
i will take it
wait a minute  this is the woman i love  that is going on who was loaded
hello mr sheldrake  on that bases loaded  i covered it with a 2page synopsis  but i would not bother
that is wrong with it
it is from hunger
nothing for ladd
just a rehash of something that was not very good to begin with
this is miss kramer
name dropper
carefull those are dirty words you sound like a bunch of new york critics  thank you miss schaefer
that was last year  this year i am trying to earn a living
let me help you  betty schaeter sheldrake's office
hurt feelings department
i have been hoping to run into you
what for to recover that knife you stuck in my back
i felt a little guilty so i got out some of your old stories
why you sweet kid
there's one calledwindow something with a window
dark windows  how did you like it
i did not
thank you
is there someplace we can talk
now if i got you correctly there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice
the flashback in the courtroom when she tells about being a school teacher
who wants true who wants moving
drop that attitude  here's some thing really worth while
want me to start right now maybe there's some paper around
we could make some paper boats and have a regatta  or should we just turn on the shower
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door
are you hungry
hungry after twelve years in the burmese jungle  i am starving lady agatha  starving for a white shoulder 
ok  i find i am terribly afraid of losing you
you will not  i will get us a refill of this awful stuff
you will be waiting for me
with a wildly beating heart
hello artie  good evening miss schaefer
is that so that is the wonderful news
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher
what teacher
dark windows  i got him all hopped up about it
you did
he thinks it could be made into something
into what a lampshade
i was afraid of that
sorry miss schaefer but i have given up writing on spec
i tell you this is half sold
sorry if i crossed you up
you sure have
i mean it  it is no good to me anyway  help yourself
look if you do not mind i have not got time to listen to the whole plot 
i will make it short
sorry  it is your baby now
i am not good enough to write it alone  we will have to do it together
what has artie to do with it
we are engaged
it is just impossible
look betty it cannot be done it is out
you are tough all right
you are on your own  stop being chickenhearted and write that story
are you kidding because i think it is good
so do i
oh you 
that is good about it  i miss him something fierce
i mean this is good dialogue along in here  it will play
it will
sure  especially with lots of music underneath drowning it out
who's norma
who's who
i am sorry  i do not usually read private cigarette cases
oh that  it is from a friend of mine  a middleaged lady very foolish and very generous
i will say  this is solid gold
nice job
should be  it cost three hundred dollars
come clean betty  at night you weep for those lost closeups those gala openings
not once  that is wrong with being on the other side of the cameras it is really more fun
three cheers for betty schaefer i will now kiss that nose of yours
may i say you smell real special
hey that is the matter betty wake up  why are you staring at me like that
was i  i am sorry
that is wrong with you tonight what is it betty
something came up  i do not want to talk about it
why not
i just do not
betty there's no use running out on it  let's face it what ever it is
it is nothing  i got a telegram from artie
stop crying  you are getting married  that is what you have always wanted
i do not want it now
why not do not you love artie
of course i love him  i always will  i am just not in love with him any more
what happened
hello betty
i do not know why i am so scared joe  is it something awful
this is where you live
you bet
that was norma desmond on the phone
want something to drink  there's always champagne on ice and plenty of caviar
why did she call me
her own movie theatre
joe i cannot look at you any more
hello young fellow
last time i saw you was someplace very gay  i remember waving to you i was dancing on a table
norma i want to apologize for not calling you
you would better  i am very angry
i am pretty busy as you can see
that is no excuse  you read the script did not you
yes i did
then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants
what assistant
do not play innocent  somebody named gordon cole
did you see them did you see how they came
goodbye young fellow  we will see what we can do
we have missed you too dear
we will be working again will not we chief we will make our greatest picture
that is what i want to talk to you about
it is a good script is not it
nothing would thrill me more  if it were possible
how much will it be  i warn you  do not give me a fancy price just because i am rich
get out
or shall i call my servant
i know your face  you are norma desmond  you used to be in pictures  you used to be big
i am big  it is the pictures that got small
ssh you will wake up that monkey
are you or are not you
i think that is what it says on my driver's license
the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ  i ought to have it taken out
how long is a movie script these days  i mean how many pages
depends on what it is  a donald duck or joan or arc
this is to be a very important picture  i have written it myself  took me years
looks like enough for six impor tant pictures
we have made a lot of pictures together
and you will play salome
who else 
they will love it in pomona
they will love it every place  read it  read the scene just before she has him killed
right now  never let another writer read your stuff  he may steal it
this is fascinating
of course it is
maybe it is a little long and maybe there are some repetitions but you are not a professional writer
i wrote that with my heart
sure you did  that is what makes it great  what it needs is a little more dialogue
what for  i can say anything i want with my eyes
it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil
i will not have it butchered
i do not know
what month
december twentyfirst
sagittarius  i like sagittarians you can trust them
thank you
i want you to do this work
me  i am busy  just finished one script  i am due on another assignment
you know i am pretty expensive i get five hundred a week
i would not worry about money i will make it worth your while
maybe i would better take the rest of the script home and read it 
oh no  i could not let it out of my house  you will have to finish it here
it is getting kind of late 
are you married mr   
the name is gillis  i am single
where do you live
hollywood  the alto nido apart ments
there's something wrong with your car you said
there sure is
you can stay here
look i am supposed to fix up your script  there's nothing in the deal about my staying here
you will like it here
thanks for the invitation but i have my own apartment
you cannot work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent
i will take care of that
it is all taken care of  it is all paid for
i am used to paying my own bills
you proud boy why did not you tell me you were having difficulties
unpack nothing  i did not say i was staying
that is that
just a scene i cut out
what scene
the one where you go to the slave market  you can cut right to the scene where john the baptist 
cut away from me
i want to talk to you for a minute
not now my dear  i am playing three no trump
they have come for my car
please  now i have forgotten how many spades are out
i need some money right now
now what is it  where is the fire
i have lost my car
that is a dreadful shirt you are wearing
i do not need any clothes and i certainly do not want you buy ing them for 
how about some evening clothes
i do not need a tuxedo
of course you do  a tuxedo and tails
tails  that is ridiculous
all padding  do not let it fool you
you know to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit
i do not like those studs they have sent  i want you to have pearls nice big pearls
now i am not going to wear ear rings i can tell you that
should not we wait for the others
not on the same floor with valentino
do not bend back like that
hold me tighter
come midnight how about blind folding the orchestra and smash ing champagne glasses on max's head
you think this is all very funny
a little
is it funny that i am in love with you
that is that
what are the notes
mad about the boy
norma i cannot take it  you have bought me enough
shut up  i am rich  i am richer than all this new hollywood trash i have got a million dollars
that is the matter with you
what right do you have to take me for granted
go away
what kind of a silly thing was that to do
to fall in love with you  that was the idiotic thing
it sure would have made attractive headlines great star kills her self for unknown writer
why do not you just say thank you and go go go 
not until you promise to act like a sensible human being
you are really going to send it to de mille
i hope you realize norma that scripts do not sell on astrologers' charts
i am not just selling the script i am selling me  demille always said i was his greatest star
have one of mine
they are awful  they make me cough
pull up at the drugstore will you max  i will get you some
what on earth darling it took you hours
i ran into some people i knew
where are my cigarettes
nothing is the matter  i am having a great time  show me some more
how do you like that we have made twelve pictures together his greatest successes
do not you want to come along darling
i do not think so  it is your script  it is your show good luck
do not turn around  keep your eyes on the book
i just came to say good night i do not want you to see me  i am not very attractive
good night

i think i will read a little

these are nothing  you can have anything you want if you will only stay  what is it you want  money
that is between you and yourself norma
see you did not believe me now i suppose you do not think i have the courage
oh  sure  if it would make a good scene
that is a lie  they still want me
no they do not
what about the studio what about de mille
he was trying to spare your feelings the studio wanted to rent your car
wanted what
de mille did not have the heart to tell you  none of us has had the heart
i am the greatest star of them all

there's no real proof that tobacco  
can i take you to the airport
not unless you can fly
i am telling you i was there
you were probably so scared you did not look to see what the trick was
it was not a trick
oh sure a man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it was not a trick
clark kent if you had only seen it the way i did you 
it was done with wires they must have rigged him like they do with peter pan
there were not any wires i looked
mirrors then it is done with mirrors
he grabbed me he held me he set me down gently how could that be done with mirrors
look there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce
you are just jealous
jealous of what
what would you call him
superman  pretty good name for him is not it

plenty about 'the crime of the century' remember
this is california the richest most populous state in america and growing like a sonofagun
i do not need a geography lesson luthor
it is just that    i spent a fortune on these things  and all for naught what a waste  
of time luthor
it would never have worked luthor you are a dreamer    a sick twisted dreamer
still foolishly perhaps i had a theory that eliminates the presidential pushbutton  i was doing my homework

which one
which one
which clinic

so there were others
other clinics  oh sure  clinics halfway houses treatment centers detox units
thenwhen did she get better
she did not
but you said
that is where i am going  to see her
she is in trouble

i hope she gets better
my name is
mister i do not want to know your name
i understand
i can help you
no mr ansel  i would not sue you
why are you telling me this
why are you telling me this
hi nicole
hi mr ansel  hi jessica mason
they just finished supper
what do you mean 'outgrown it'
i am not sure
goodnight mr ansel
why would he do that  you did not have anything to do with the accident
billy please  the children
how is nicole  is she around
she is resting  in her room
i do not see how that concerns you billy
why not
because it is what we have to do
well i do not want a damned thing to do with it
no billy  we cannot drop the lawsuit  you know how much we need the money
why  you got money from dolores' insurance with the school board  we all did
nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight  she will be there around six
billy that is too early
she said she is got to be home by nine
have you been waiting long
a while
does this mean i cannot take a shower
what time's he coming home
it is natural
your kids never cry
well maybe that is because they know i am going to follow them  behind the bus
you are leaving
good night billy
mr stephens says that someone did not put a right bolt in the bus
risa i serviced that bus  at the garage  there's nothing wrong with it
or that the guardrail was not strong enough
you believe that
because i have to
dolores  no one calls me 'mrs driscoll'
what do you mean by that dolores
about the ottos
i mean the way they look  their hair and clothing
those are all from the fair last year  abbott and me were judges at the pet show
from what
from what
you talked about it
yes  the oldfashioned way
and that is that
were his parentsattentive to him
what do you mean
you mentioned that he had a learning disability
that is right
did his parents attend to that
what do you mean
i have a question for you mr stephens
that would complicate things
he knows that  billy
yes  he does
you have talked to billy
i did
it is clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event
what other people
excuse me
that is what he said is it
he never took his eyes off his mother even as he moved to sit beside nicole  he looked frightened
why would he be frightened
good morning wanda  hi hartley
what do you think
well it is certainly what you would call interesting
you hate it
i did not say that
i could wrap it up  protect the other kids
it is for the school bazaar
oh it is bizarre alright  c'mon bear  let's get you out of here
i did not ask if you wanted milk
no  a little sugar though
we have only got honey
he thought it was cute when i called him frankenstein  it was not  i feel like his monster
is not it a lovely day
what happened to summer
summer's over  it is fall
and winter
how was it
so do you like your new room
it is interesting
your dad spent all his spare time in here  he wanted to make it absolutely perfect
is this mine
yes  it is a present
from you
no  from mr stephens  that was him on the phone just now  he was calling to see how you were
that was billy ansel on the phone he wants to come over to talk to us
was he drinking  could you tell
is he coming over now  right away
hey billy  what brings you out on a night like this  c'mon in  take a load off
that is a ditty again
can i sit beside you on the bus tomorrow
do not you usually like to sit at the back  to wave at your dad
becausehe wanted to them to be punished
so he was mean
you can only feel lucky that you did not die for so long  then you start to feelunlucky
that you did not die  like the other children
it would be strange if you did not feel that way
i will not lie
i do not want you to lie
the truth is that it was an accident and no one's to blame
there's no such thing as an accident nicole  not in a situation like this
you seem very sure about that
i object to the form of that question  note that
there was nothing reckless in mrs driscoll's behavior
note my objection  she said 'as i am talking'
note that she said 'pretty clearly' not 'clearly'
i have no questions
do you have a room
will you be spending more than a night
what about doreen
that is the local bar
what do you mean
tell me about the ottos
they are smart  been to college they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago
need a hand
you always think you are prepared for these things
tell me about it
how old is she
almost three
nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me zoe
so that is the problem
why cannot you talk to me
do not you want to hear
that is not news zoe
what do you want me to do zoe i will do whatever you want
i need money
do you have the blood test
you do not believe me  you do not fucking believe me
i can hear you breathing daddy
some more wine
i am afraid this meat is overdone
i am sorry about that mr stephens would you like to try the fish
what is it
we do
if you could pick the shrimp off as well as anything that touches the shrimp
i am not sure if that will leave much on the plate
who are you
i am a lawyer
you cannot come here
the walkers spoke very highly of you
it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger  not their grief
so you are just the thing we need
excuse me
is not that what you want us to believe  that we are completely defenseless  that you know that is best
kyle lambstongs a drunk  nobody likes him  he is a nasty piece of work
been drinking since high school fucked himself up  used to be smart enough
any criminal record
probably half a dozen traffic convictions  drunk driving  lost his licence  that is why he do not work no more
cannot get off that shitty dump they live on  what little money comes in goes to booze
how does the family survive
what time in the morning was this
about eightthirty in the morning
no  i was alone  my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day
was there anything unusual about the driver dolores driscoll or the bus that particular morning
and where did you sit that morning
my usual place  on the right side the first seat
and according to your recollection there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning
you remember that much
i was scared
why were you scared
this is before the accident nicole do you understand what i am asking
yes i understand
why were you scared
mrs  driscoll was driving too fast what made you think that nicole
the speedometer  and it was downhill there
you could see the speedometer
how fast would you say mrs driscoll was going  to the best of your recollection
seventytwo miles an hour
you believe that the bus driven by mrs driscoll was going at seventy two miles an hour at this time
why not
i was scared  and there was not time
there was not time
no  because the bus went off the road  and crashed
you remember this
you are going to blow everyone away
you mean it
of course
you do not sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure
that is that
mrs  ansel's clothing
they say i am lucky because i cannot remember the accident
how do you like it nicole

you broke my arm
you are already dead silberman  everybody here dies  you know i believe that  so do not fuck with me
this t1000 what happens when you shoot it

the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation
why him
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor
yes  it launches its icbms against their targets in russia

because skynet knows the russian counterstrike will remove its enemies here
jesus  how much do you know about dyson
i have detailed files
the cpu from the first terminator
i must be destroyed
is it safe for them here
it is finally over
it is not just a dream  it is real you moron i know the date is happens
where do you stand on all this

oh and do not wave your hands about
respect your elders and your betters
and no elbows on the table
eating is eating and
what does he mean too correct

major richards said he would call to let us know
five minutes
you have a question for helmuth david
yes david
major i do not see how this line of questioning could
major this is deeply offensive and repugnant
you bet
when you question him again could you treat him with more respect
with more what more what
major he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect
david i do not understand a thing about you you are a jew are you a jew
hello major my name is dymshitz i am glad to see you
colonel pleasure
so major tell me have you questioned dr furtwngler
furtwngler's in a different category

no can do
let furtwngler go please
i am gonna get that fucking bandleader colonel no deal no fucking deal
okay let's see how long were you in the camp for

i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape how did you do that
i do not remember in detail there were so many
did you call someone you knew
or maybe you called goebbels or goering you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them
when will my case be heard by the tribunal
your guess is as good as mine
i need to work i need to make my living i live off the generosity of friends
i do not know he was not my case why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended
it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me
you sure knew a lot of people in high places
steve arnold
i was warned
who warned you
goering because hinkel was working for goebbels
if it is too hot open your tie
i wish to say something
and what was that
i have no idea what you are talking about
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal adolf hider

okay so what is it
bruckner's seventh the adagio
helmuth alfred rode second violinist since 1935 that is it mean second violinist

one of your people told me
yes a corporal us army a jew he said he would seen the telegram in the chancellery
there's a rumour i do not know if it is true or not but ask him about von der null

edwin von der null music critic he gave furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan
and ask him about his private life

conscientious determined dogged
rudolf otto werner wind section since 1936 what instrument did you play
first oboe
i have your questionnaire here it says you were never a member of the nazi party
no i was never a nazi i have no interest in politics i am a musician 
dr furtwngler is a great musician he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape
brave  to celebrate hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute bravo
it was beethovengs ninth
not supposed to talk about it
i think you better tell us
we do not even know you
well we are fbi agents
i think that about does it spooky
does what
why do not you go home to the old lady 
scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting 
you called 911 except the call was intercepted
special agent scully 
i apologize for making you wait  i have brought some new evidence with me 
 those are very serious allegations agent scully 
and you have conclusive evidence of this something to tie this claim of yours to the crime 
i hope to we are working to develop this evidence 
working with
this mangs still alive
how can this be
do you want me to destroy this one too before it gestates
no nowe need to try our vaccine on it
and if it is unsuccessful
incinerate it like the others
this mangs family will want to see the body laid to rest
tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life and that he died heroically like the other firemen
we have a situation the members are assembling
who called this meeting
my lateness may have well been absence a course has already been taken
is this dr kurtzweil's residence
you got some kind of business with him
i am looking for him
feds are looking for him too  real nice business he is got huh
that is that
you looking for him for some other reason
you want a call if we turn up kurtzweil
i am looking for anything out of the ordinary maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found
we were not expecting to find those remains of course they went right off to washington
have you examined them
you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found
how is that
you follow me out here for a reason
my name's kurtzweil dr alvin kurtzweil
i know the name why
how would you find me
heard you come here now and again figured you would be needing a little drinky tonight
you a reporter
i am a doctor but i think i mentioned that obgyn
who sent you
and that is that
sac darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb
he just let it explode
that is the question nobody's asking why that building why not the federal building
those people were already dead
before the bomb went off
you are saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen
i think you are full of shit
see this bullshit somebody knows i am talking to you
they want to discredit you  for what
for what because i am a dangerous man because i know too much about the truth
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write i knew your name was familiar i just did not know why
i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government the daily newspaper
how can i reach you
you found something
i am not sure a virus 
 you saw this experiment
what do you think
a transportation system transgenic crops the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus
that would be my guess
you told me you had answers
yeah well i do not have them all
you have been using me 
i have been using you
you did not know my father 
i told you  he and i were old friends 
mulder  it is me 
where are you scully
i am on the roof
did you find something
no i have not
you are looking for a bomb
i know that but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street
i know you are bored in this assignment but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now
now what
had you
no you did not
i saw your face mulder there was a moment of panic
panic have you ever seen me panic scully
alright what will it be coke pepsi a saline iv
scully i found the bomb
where are you mulder
scully get somebody to open this door
mulder tell me this is a joke
thirteen fifty six
something's not right
whatever you told them in there you do not have to protect me
all i told them was the truth
they are trying to divide us on this scully we cannot let them
they have divided us mulder they are splitting us up
what what are you talking about
i think you must have an idea they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993
are you drunk mulder
i was until about an hour ago
what are you implying scully
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting
go home mulder it is late
get dressed scully
mulder  what are you doing
this is one of the firemen who died in dallas
according to this tag
it is like jelly
you knew this man did not die at the bomb site before we got here
i would been told as much
why are you whispering
i cannot really talk right now
what did you find
evidence of a massive infection
what kind of infection
i have got a hearing tomorrow 
 i will have you back for it scully maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away
he did not mention a park
the bone was porous as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it
and you have never seen anything like that
this looks like new grass to you
ground's dry about an inch down somebody just laid this down very recently i would say
all the equipment is brand new
unmarked tanker trucks what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks
i do not know mulder
and where are they going with it
what are my choices
about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction
where would they be going
you think they went left
hey i was right about the bomb was not i
we are not chasing trucks we are chasing evidence 
 of what exactly
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off to hide something bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself
they haul gas in tanker trucks they haul oil in tanker trucks  they do not haul viruses in tanker trucks
yeah well they may this one
what do you mean by haul  what are you not telling me here
what do you think it is
this is weird mulder
very weird
any thoughts on why anybody would be growing corn in the middle of the desert
cool in here temperature's being regulated
you hear that
i hear the humming like electricity high voltage maybe
what are you doing
where would they go
what that is wrong
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation
you cannot quit scully
i can mulder i debated whether or not to even tell you in person because i knew 
we are close to something here  we are on the verge 
you are on the verge mulder  please do not do this to me 
after what you saw last night  after all you have seen  you cannot just walk away 
i have i did it is done
just like that 
i am contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers 
i need you on this scully 
what what happened
my pulse feels thready and i have got a funny taste in the back of my throat
i think you are in anaphylactic shock 
we have got to keep moving
where are we
i cannot go any farther
we are going to the morgue
that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel
on whose orders
i do not know anything about that
well call general mcaddie
i do not have his number
why do not you go on ahead head and i will confirm authorization
sit down they are still talking to agent scully
about what
 they are asking her for a narrative they want to know why she was in the wrong building
but it is not the lives we saved it is the lives we did not
 if it looks bad it is bad for the fbi 
 if they want someone to blame they can blame me agent scully does not deserve this
agent mulder 
she is missing we have been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in
how deep does this go
are we being watched
what are you doing
mr mulder
what happened to kurtzweil
where is scully
i have answers for you
i am quite prepared to tell you everything though there is not much you have not guessed
about the conspiracy
i think of it as an agreement a word your father liked to use
what is it
a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with it must be administered with ninety six hours
this is what you have been conspiring to conceal a disease
aids the ebola virus  on the evolutionary scale they are newborns this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs
until dallas we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism that mass infection would make us a slave race
why are you telling me this
i thought it only fair you should know given how hard you have worked
what happened to kurtzweil
as your father knew things need to be sacrificed to the future
where is he
what alien environment
find agent scully save her only her science can save the future
what about you
we began to worry some of us have traveled so far and you are the last to arrive
more concerns than that
my god
our vaccine may have no effect
no one believes kurtzweil or his books he is a toiler a crank
you cannot kill mulder he is got too much light on him
you need not kill a man to destroy him
sing a song of sixpence
a pocketful of rye
did we go sailing
almost  mockylock showed up
mockylock is the bogeyman mockylock wants me where i am
he hates me
she adores you
she thinks i can bring edward back
we have been over this a dozen times  no
why not  just once  a trial run  what harm could it do
he creates the obstacles he decides which games to play
i have heard this argument before  it is not happening
i do it all the time
yes but you are a willing participant picture edward in a strange place lost frightened
good  we need you healthy and relaxed you are going to eat well meditate exercise and watch mindless television
henry wants me to try this vietnamese place he is wild about  want to come
i have got to feed my cat  besides i want to get to bed early
sing a song of sixpence

thanks miriam  say hi to henry and
give a kiss to edward
what if he was not like this  what if he was normal  conscious  how far would you go
i still do not understand why i cannot do this this is not some troubled kid you are dealing with
i realize that
this man is deeply disturbed he
you do not know the procedure
edward baines i presume  hi ed  i am pete
do you think that is funny
it does not have much to do with science
what then
the soul  the spirit  whatever you want to call it
agent novak
peter okay
absolutely  i suppose everyone does
just like we all have fantasies right things only we know that we do not share
with stargher i saw things
why would you bring him here
you are the shrink you tell me
you thought stargher wanted to be caught
i did yeah
it is hard for me to see stargher as human capable of something like remorse
if you believe that
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time
what happened
what difference does it make
you are sure of that
remember julia hickson is priority number one  nothing else matters  find out where she is
he wants us to follow  the little boy

she changed the codes
that is wrong
instead of going into his mind
when did he lapse into the coma
i have to ask you some things are you taking any prescription drugs
prevacid  for my stomach
i know your partner's here but it is very important that you are honest

well charlie just why do you think your cat did not kill the contreras girl
you know  not scared enough nothing to scare it
oh i am only exploring your theory let's take a step further you drink do not you charlie
i drink
then what do you do
i do not know
now i know i did not hurt nobody when i was drunk  
of course not charlie i never thought you did
they all say the cat killed this second girl
where is that man
sure i like my leopards
charlie was not drunk last night
i am sick
here have a cigarette he was only kidding
i do not know i want to see robles
what do you want to see him for
i want him to lock me up
look charlie you did not do it and you know you did not
two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
that is left of him
north  in an arroyo shot through the head  maybe week ago no good skin everything gone 
they are fools why do not they let charlie howcome hunt it alone he is an indian
what did they say before the bad card came up
something black  something on its way to you 
do not look at it
the death card  
he will be waiting
you must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave
pedro is waiting for me too
rosita  i have wondered 
what senorita
yes so i have noticed jerry's noticed  he will come up with something
you think be's pretty nice do not you
why not he is a good press agent and a good friend besides we have shared a lot of headaches 
i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl
oh dear  i do not know what i am going to do without you  honestly i do not 
hey  i am over here
oh mr galbraith i am so glad you are here
oh that is so interesting
well i would best be off
it is about the leopard
you are worrying about its killing someone else
yes i want to go out and patrol the town  be everywhere at once  be sure nothing happens to anybody
of course it is the way any decent man would feel in your position
you know about animals  their habits  will it come back
that is right of course
it does not know how to hunt its natural prey
but it does not eat what it kills
you know charlie howcome
come to look around
more or less
charlie and i were talking that is one reason i wanted to see you
charlie does not think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery
some crazy guy
yes but what sort of a man
come on charlie let's go find another and better suspect
do not you want to see the rest of the exhibit
you must admit it is possible that it might have been a man
but all those fancy courses were about the dead jerry not the living
to the eye like other men
it was you
not i tell you no
you shot the leopard we know that you killed consuelo you killed clo clo then tonight 
i did not do anything she screamed something frightened her
consuelo screamed too  and clo clo why did you do it why quick tell me why
it is better you do not know
tell me
that was unfortunate
i have disturbed	you i am sorry 
i thought they came right past here 
you can go now manning there is no way we can hold you legally responsible
go on foot
that is why it just mauls and tears at them
what are you getting at
i have been trying to tell him sheriff he will not listen to me
let me get one thing clear did galbraith make a direct accusation
state hunters
chief do not you understand what this means
you think galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse
galbraith knows something he as good as said so 
that is a fact is not it
get it out of here
kiki  he will not hurt you there's nothing to be afraid of
makes no difference get him out
listen kicks you will never guess what i have cooked up this tine
on his back i suppose
no i thought that might be just a little corny i want you to lead him in on a leash
you are too good to me
look kicks have i ever done anything to hurt you
no  not yet
and i never will you know that is between us  we are a thing but this is serious competition
get it out of here
kiki  he will not hurt you there's nothing to be afraid of
makes no difference  get him out
listen kicks you will never guess what i have cooked up this time
on his back i suppose
no i thought that might be just a little corny  i want you to lead him in on a leash
you are too good to me
look kicks how long have we known each other
this is l939 cannot you subtract
almost three years is not it and have i ever done anything to hurt you
no  not yet
you look swell in that threealarm number 
are you all right
suppose i slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses
i suppose he was trying to make me feel bad
who was the other man
i do not know  a witness he seemed to know something about animals  you know  expert testimony
what did he have to do  look at the body
who is he
	as long as my feet held out
i can use them
that was nice of mr galbraith
pretty you know  it is funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now
jerry these flowers are not really for me 
you mean you want to take them to the cemetery
why do you want to stay around here it will only make you feel badly
maybe i want to feel badly
what else do you care about kicks
i am glad you care about us kicks sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket 
confession i am a complete softie i have been consciencestricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away 
kiki  it was not the leopard
you are positive of that are not you
oh by the way  i am out of cash 
did not you take your cut out of the closing check
i got into a little crap game
as a matter of fact i am out of cash myself
what you cannot be 
i  i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise 
eloise does not own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check kicks
all right i am not ashamed of it i split it two ways 
half to the delgado family and half to cloclo's family
no no thanks  now we have got to do it ourselves
we stood here once before
i know  teresa 
i hated you that day  you and your flip talk  with that little girl lying dead
oh dear why is life so complicated sometimes i really wish i could be someone else
that is a good idea sire
what do you mean
my dear aulon to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood
majesty i cannot
why are you not ready to die for your king
of course i am it is just that
sire you know how bad i am at this sort of game
very generous of you all  how much
my dear aulon  that is fine
jean it is it is not so easy
what do you fear most now my sword   or his hands
i would like some fresh straw
yes  i did not confess today
better today than tomorrow
i also need someone who can read and write
this i can do  i was studying at the university of paris  till the english invaded it
i thought you were an archer
yes i am  i am an archer who can read and write  who do you want to write to
who do they think i am
jeanne stop it
he did not tell you to cut all your hair off
what did they say
that is going on
not so easily  why are not you fighting  go on we are almost there
jeanne you have been badly wounded
alright i promise to rest if you promise to go back to the battle
i will go
jeanne  are you alright
yes  yes i am fine  we need more brushwood  why are you staring at me like that
jeanne the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore
they have abandoned me like everyone
what what do you mean
it is been weeks since they spoke to me  since the coronation no signs nothing
all you have to do is stop talking and just listen
but how do you know what you hear is the truth
i do not know it  i feel it
you make it sound so simple
so even you do not believe in me anymore
if you really want to help me there's one thing you can do
tell me
that is not what i asked why do you want to marry me
what did the king say
he said that he is making a treaty with the duke of burgundy and
it is a trap  they are buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england
did your voices tell you that  you told me you had not heard them for months
no but
or maybe it is jeanne who's in a trap  her own trap  a downward spiral that she cannot stop
did you come back to marry me or to insult me
but it is what i want
will you at least let me stay with you
we must sound the retreat
get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side
but why that is the point
do as i say
i want to stay with you
i am ready now
just give me a moment and then you will be free
i am already free
my gentle captain i am staying
i  i do not understand
i am not afraid of the fire anymore it will purify me
we have to press home the attack
sound the retreat
but i promised jeanne we would fight on
i made no such promise  sound the retreat for the night
i will not tell you more about that i am more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you
did god forbid you to tell the truth
go onto the next question
good advice for the french not for the english  do you think god hates the english
is it true that you launched an attack on paris
i tried to
it was on a sunday was not it
i do not remember  maybe
do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day
no i said surrender in the name of the king of france
do you have a sword
quite a few
which did you prefer your banner or your sword
i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword
and why was that  did it have some particular value or power
to avoid killing anyone
no of course not i never killed anyone
we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner
yes probably maybe
so sometimes you were carrying just your sword
yes but
did you use the sword that you held in your hand
no i i held it up to
you held up your sword and flourished it about in the air like this
i do not understand the holy oil of clovis it was quite full the last time i saw it
and when was that
well at the coronation of king charles vi
wwwhat are you doing
arrest them
what are you doing  this is an ecclesiastical court  you have no right to do this
but if this trial seems fixed i fear you will have the very opposite result to the one you want
calm down my lord i beg you
it is not for us to burn her my lord  that is your prerogative
 and your prerogative is to find her guilty
scared of a girl
so here is the famous jeanne savior of orleans terror of the english  you look pretty ordinary to me
am i am i dead
dead you are worthless darling
god defeated the english not me
are you alright  did they hurt you
no no i am fine really
quick  hide in here
what about you
do not worry about me  just stay in here and do not move
but where are you going to be
i will hear you but not now not here
trial  what trial
your trial jeanne  on a charge of heresy
but the king  my king  did not he pay my ransom
it seems that the english care more about you than the french
the english
show us a little more cooperation first  where were you born
in a village called domremy
how old are you
nineteen or thereabouts
were you baptized
yes  in the church at domremy
recite the lord's prayer
jeanne  be careful  you are not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment
these questions have nothing to do with your trial
i assure you they do  so answer me when was the last time you heard this voice
not long ago
when exactly  a day a week  when
what did it tell you
many things
sign this and i will confess you myself if you want
and may i go to mass
please may i have it back
i did not mean it  i did not know what i was signing  you tricked me
i do not understand jeanne why did you do it  why
and you  why did you lie  you promised i could be confessed
i know jeanne it was the only way to save you from the fire
i ask only one thing to hear me in confession
good day sir  i trust my honorable duke of burgundy is feeling well
he is feeling wonderful
thanks be to god
20000  but i heard king charles was financially embarrassed
wwwhat has that got to do with this maiden
who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions
you will
but her army's so small now
there's no need to be afraid sire
i am i am not the king
ah jeanne come here  this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco nothing is ready
 you look wonderful
get them out of here
gave you  well now i would not quite put it like that
supposing she is an assassin
your majesty i really think you
my dear loyal tremoille i know i can count on you
 as always majesty
when you saw your king for the first time was there an angel over his head
if there was i did not see it
then why did your king believe in you without any proof
his face
is it long and hanging down
go on to the next question
5000 gold crowns
may i without offending you inquire how generous
8000  we cannot raise more we can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity
were you sent by lord dunois
yes they were
good  where are the english
i know
good  can you bring me to him
wait wait
ah so that is it  to you i am just a girl
jeanne put yourself in my shoes for a moment  how would you feel if you were me
dunois was it you who ordered the attack  answer me
can we  uh  discuss this later
position the longbows over there crossbows over there  and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees
the wind will be against us
that is going on
jeanne what are you doing with that you have got it back to front
stand by with the batteringrams
we need another ten minutes
well  shall we go
not yet
yes it is a miracle
but do not you think we should at least go and welcome her
brilliant idea but to be really effective why not send a whole army of virgins
god why of course  we would forgotten about him  strange i do not seem to remember seeing him at agincourt
damn right
i do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked
there must be something we can do for her for chrissakes
yes  we can pray
this is no good
and what does jeanne think
we return to orleans across the bridge at the tourelles
but the bridge has been pulled down
you look disappointed is not this what you wanted
no not like this
jeanne let him do it  one more dead body's not going to make any difference so who cares
bravo  what about all the other hundreds of prisoners  do we let them go too
jeanne the men are exhausted
i know but so is the enemy  they are falling back  paris is ours
jeanne we are not enough
so bring up the reinforcements
right behind us  dunois with another then thousand men
jeanne look behind you
do you know how to count
of course i do  bring them up
jeanne that is not ten thousand reinforcements  that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers
who told you to wear mengs clothes
it was just more convenient as i was among soldiers
so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man
i submit to our lord
tell us jeanne why did you jump from the tower at beaurevoir
i had been sold to the english  i would rather die than fall into their hands
i know but that is not the way things happened
you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge
yes but
stop it  what are you doing
nothing just taking his teeth
but you cannot just kill a man for his teeth
why not  he has good teeth
besides what about these
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river
hey my friend  i am glad to see your ugly damn face again
la hire i am warning you  do not swear
jeanne let me introduce the king's half brother the dogged lord dunois
jesus christ the goddamn english will pay for this
what happened  who gave the order to attack
god knows but it was a bad idea
prepare these as batteringrams
that is the use  the drawbridge is up
we won
you call this glory  all this this blood this smell of
 the smell of victory jeanne mmmmmmm  i love it
take mine instead  here  smash mine first
jeanne get up this is ridiculous
jeanne if you do not mind i will stay standing this armor it is a nightmare to get back up
when you were taken prisoner at compiegne did you have a horse
yes a halfsteed white
who gave you that horse
my king
how many did he give you
five steeds and a few hackneys
what about all those dresses you were given silk dresses were not they
yes i was given a few but i never had time to wear them
still pretty wealthy for a peasant girl would not you say
what have you done to me
who who are you
who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil  are you god
i do not know i thought
you think god is not big enough to deliver his own messages
i do not know please tell me i am dead
who are you to decide if you should live or die
i do not know what do you want from me
what are you doing out here
i might ask you the same question
i i am leaving i cannot take anymore
and what exactly is it that you cannot take anymore of
oh  and just because you realize now everybody else should forgive you
i do not understand  what do you want from me
why were you yelling like that
what are you doing here  please leave you cannot stay here
my visions
they are going to come and visit you in here
yes that is what i pray for
i want to see that  do you mind if i stay on the side  i will not bother you
no no  you cannot stay or they will not come
why not
they will not come anyway
what do you mean they will not come
god asked you to do something
yes lots of things
you mean god said i need you jeanne
no but he sent me so many signs
no  that was a sword in a field
i am not lying i i cannot remember leave me alone
no  i do not want to know anymore leave me alone  i did not kill that man
in his name
no i do not think so  i do not think that killing each other will ever bring peace
i do not agree  why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time
i  i cleaned up my room look and i said my prayers all of them and
what are you doing on the wall
i am trying to make my cross look more beautiful
what for
because because i do not know what else to do to please him
do you think this cross will protect you
love your enemies
my voices my voices do you think they will ever come back
i do not think so
are you going to leave me too
yes of course when you do not need me anymore
there's nothing for me to do here anymore i do not belong here i want to be with him now
yes i am
you think you are ready now
yes my lord
you know i am always happy to see you jeanne but to keep coming here twice three times a day
i need to confess
but you already confessed this morning
i need to confess again
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some
there's no sin in charity jeanne
they were not my shoes  mine were too small
whose were they
my father's
i am sure he will forgive you
he already did but i want god to forgive me too
jeanne  if we were to ask forgiveness all the time we would spend our whole life in church
is that bad
well no but jeanne are you happy at home

you leave the kid alone
a tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and
you would go with him

let me look at it
ai not got time
i tell yuh i ai not got no bracelet
i saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe
yer crazyi ai not got no bracelet
then why did you run away
i appreciate your assistance m but this is now a military operation
it is too late 
why was not the ship protected why was it sailing without radar
i resent your tone sir i have men who are missing 
at least we know where the gold is when are the recovery ships due
always nice to meet one of her majesty's fellow subjects  especially one with such distinguished friends
i hope you have enjoyed this little charade
mr bond nice to see you
sir elliot
i see
i tried to save her but she remained a manic depressive fits inappropriate behavior delusions of grandeur
i wonder if it runs in the family
still i do miss her i only wish she could have lived to see all this
i call this the rogue's gallery
although it must be fun to have all those satellites
and that is that my dear
i am sure they will
 instant meltdown
as the advertising says tomorrow never lies
i would rather die alone
in the strait of malacca when a boat is even five minutes late one begins to worry mr bond
i know pirates from sumatra want the cargo smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships
sometimes kill the crew other times   torture them
did you test the autopilots the satellite positioning receiver
next morning both boats nothing wrong  my 90 year old grandfather thinks 'ghost in the computer  silicon dragong
i appreciate your time 
maybe you should talk to sidney winch owns a marine salvage company nobody knows more about the strait
where can i find him

actually i have never known you to do either but 
 we all want what we cannot have

your new car 
i must say q you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement
wait a minute 
that is all well and good captain save for one thing  there's no gold down there
what are you talking about we went through all this and the ship is not even down there
yes the ship is down there but the gold is gone
that is absurd it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold
paris what are you doing here

oh james i have missed you 
is this another one of your games
stop it you are hurting me cannot you just be nice
do you feel better now

saunders i have lit cigarettes

thanks  take care 
bourbon neat

 and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake
have we met
this afternoon our boats practically kissed in the harbor  james bond
vodka martini shaken not stirred  and another for you
chaperone i am waiting for my dinner date
actually i am here on business you might say it was a golden opportunity
and exactly what business are you in mr bond
i will keep that in mind
i see my date is here  and i think mr bond is ready to leave
nice to run into you again
do i have to do everything around here
i hope you will be gentle
and what do you call this
if i were you 
 you are not
just remember they think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there
why do not we just take these 
you heard me a gun  i left mine in the car
elliot harmsway is my uncle
blood or dutch
he was my father's best friend
he is killed closer
you are seriously deranged
this has got to be a mistake
wait here
 how did you get into marine salvage
not a lot of difference
what the hell does that do
what now and do not give me some movie clich like 'trust me'
put your back to the railing sit up on it
are you listening to me
put your arms around my neck lock your legs around my waist
sometimes you just have to 
is this  like  a normal day for you
here you shoot i will drive
you know that is another reason you are probably not in a successful relationship
another reason did i miss something
if it is radio controlled it will break the code
if not
sleep well
what do you mean you would rather die alone
first that boat is in international waters i am claiming it for salvage onethird of that gold is mine
come in 007 you know the minister
tell me 007 what do you know about elliot harmsway
 along with tomorrow  the first worldwide newspaper circulation 27 million daily 
 that is harmsway done
of course
which is also why i have withheld this information from nato and our allies
you are to wear this mask at the venice carnival and wait to be contacted
 i hate to ask but did you ever think you would miss communism
but if elliot harmsway is involved with that uranium i want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth
i will give you a ring from venice
sorry i am late 
you are turning into quite the politician 007
i have an excellent teacher  'make sure you wear the uniform'
what do you make of all this
 and what do you call these
jashwa tsway these are lips
and what do you call these the gang of two
stop it
i was just getting to the interesting part
we have already done the interesting part do you forget
is that mandarin or cantonese
tsi tien mr bond
who's in charge here
i am what do you want
you have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way

i was an attorney
you will not get away with this
the canadian prime minister wants to set a lunch 
pencil it in for the next trip 
the american presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story 
send him a $10000 campaign contribution and explain i have no control over what my journalists write 
damn it is doing it again
that is wrong
the backup does the same thing
how is it now
what is he doing here
obviously the british government denies all of this 
 i told you he was there 
he brought that up from the wreck
well i do believe this requires further investigation
how sweet
that was too close
please sidney i would like to remember you fondly
approaching the first gate
hong kong mr bond

fueled and waiting
it is a trick after him  they are in the south stairwell

you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 12 baths mean
pops put big daddy's farm in rhonda's and sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it
why does he always pick on me
linda how come you do not see that sunny puts his shoes on right

like a veil has been lifted
it is like i have been swimming in muddy waters
like muddy waters
it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like
you were in hell
i could not believe the things i was doing it was like an internal struggle going on inside my body
do you think you won
it was nip and tuck
and what lesson have we learned from all of this babe br sam i mean samuel
who is it
i was hoping you came to the door instead of him it gets cold at night
this does not make any sense you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air
does not he look a whole of lot better
i need to get my suitcase out of the garage
what for
i am going back home with harry
i have heard some foolish things in my life
what is that
never play with someone's else's cards you always get a new deck look at this card see anything
i could swear i heard my son call me
you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there
you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock
i always had chickens ducks and whatnots
well you just have to move further out
now how far would further out be
my mind plays tricks on me is it okay if i take a bath now
do not bother the poor boy it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are
let us settle this tomorrow
your feet are cold
go back to sleep
i asked you to wake me when babe brother comes
you all act like two roosters
i am not going to let him get away with murder

you know babe brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them
well it is up to suzie
do you want your coat it is cold out here

i do not want to hear any tales about colored people
this is my grandson sunny he is my youngest songs child
boy that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom

good morning
you ought to come hear our preacher remember old cat iron well our preacher is just as strong

he was not able to get out of bed today
that smells like fresh coffee
let me get you a cup
how is he doing
good afternoon ladies
as god is my witness i have never done anything to that woman
you must have done something to her
since she has repented all she does is throw stones
you invited me
there is something that i always wanted to know tell me how did those boys die
now who are we talking about
miss clara's boy emory to start with the johnsongs hocker was another one
hocker's death almost caused a race riot a lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that
those boys never did have good luck
you damn right they did not especially emory my cousin
a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days
that is nice
how many people do you all feed
last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals
good god almighty bless your bones  but the problem grows
i could not believe it when suzie called and said you were staying here how have you been
girl do you still sing and dance
some people grow up and change their ways
i know your mother ai not still operating that house of hers
none of your business
you know the saying your heart is in your left hand
now i was trying to be nice to make conversation since we go back some
is this your house
in the meantime harry can slaughter us a hog
all the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering
not you must not touch your mama might not like you handling knives
i think he wants to see your rabbit foot
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago
some folks take that natural stuff too far
junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator that is why i do not eat over there now
no but i might have some indian chief tonic
you know okra asked me to marry him the other evening
i cannot accuse him just dry long 80
everybody who have been associated with harry end up with pennies over their eyes
what must i do
we cannot really bring another family in here with us
why not harry says that is the only way to do good
when did you talk to harry
he just leeches off your parents he is a master at wearing out welcome
harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock
what are you doing
counting the gray hairs in your head
counting the what what does that have to do with the price of butter
i was just trying to make conversation
where is skip
he is in his pigeon cage
i am sorry he got those birds
how are you
tolerably well i brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses
i did not mean for you to pay me for that
i know you did not but you have been so thoughtful
but when your sunflowers come up i will pay you for them
still this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally
i do not know what you mean
i i do not really know

that is frustrating
i think she is lying
honey this is difficult but we have all had our moments  i tried 
stop  you experimented in college i do not want to hear about that
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is
to begin with she is only sixteen yearsold
because i am at the edge of my capabilities robert
the first thing we have to do is present a unified front
if you start in on the war metaphors i am going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole
i am not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello
i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day  that is different
oh it is

i want to know who is responsible for this treatment
yes sir
we are not barbarians
yes sir
bring this man a change of good clothes  has he eaten
i do not know sir
why do you say that mr marquez
i hear these stories  your husband in jail  his business in chaos various people fighting over the scraps
i do not think you are going to do that
you do not  listen to this woman in a mangs world a very violent world
there are plenty of other suppliers in mexico
my husband had been working on something he called the project for the children  are you aware of this
i do not know  perhaps i remember something
we have the ability to change the color odor and physical property of cocaine
you want to smuggle narcotics in mr espastico jacobo  that is nothing new
every part from his ears to his accessory belt is highimpact pressuremolded cocaine  odorless undetectable by dogs  undetectable by anyone
you first
i am six months pregnant  i will not do it

oh really  general salazar was there
javi  come on  do not pull this you do not care bullshit  this is incredible information  it must be javi 
it is important that we work together mexico  america  one hand washing the other
we agree
so maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations
we thought maybe you would have that kind of information for us
you should feel good about this
that is your name
javier rodriguez
one question  how did you find about this
an informant
what is the name of your informant
that is your past  i want to talk about your future  would you be willing to do something for me
if i can
i am trying to bust the tijuana cartel
what is it you want me to do
does this offer include my partner
only if he can be trusted
i am curious how you did this with such economy
i am aware of that
it could mean that yes
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power
my work keeps me young
michael you represent drug dealers not civil libertarians
we kidnapped noriega out of panama is that covered in your constitution because it is not in mine
i am looking for my daughter caroline she comes here
this is a business  get the fuck outta here
i have money 
i got money
i will pay you a thousand dollars  i have it in my wallet
i want your money i will take your money
she is not at that place you sent her
she snuck away  and we have not seen her  she has not come home
oh man 
can you tell me anything  do you have any ideas
i do not know what to say
i am not the police  i do not care about experimentation  she is a kid i am worried to death
you will not say anything to my parents
i do not give a fuck about your parents 
hey man i am sorry  i am just trying to help

big time absolutely fucking radge 'it is me or iggy pop time to decide'
so that is it going to be
a walk
well what are you waiting for
qual se tu
it is i  the journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one
it was not the barrier stood between us  but we breached it
magnificent you are the first to find me
we sought only your infinite wisdom
and how did you breach the barrier
with a starship
this starship could it carry my wisdom beyond the barrier
it could yes
then i shall make use of this starship
he has his doubts
why why have you done this to my friend
no no it is not possible
bring me the ship or i will destroy you
the ship
i could not help but notice you pain
my pain
bad news gentlemen shore leave's been cancelled
rescued at last
do not tell them you are lost you will never live it down
my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees
sulu look the sungs come out it is a miracle
admit it we are lost
um yes we have been caught in a blizzard
sulu what are you doing
plotting our new course
following new course warp seven
in firing position torpedo armed
shuttle en route
mr chekov i have lost the bird of prey she must have cloaked
raise shields
but the shuttle
that is emergency landing plan b
this is the starship enterprise
that is going on
i instruct you to surrender you are under attack by federation forces
can we have it quiet
you caught me on my way to the shower
i apologize for canceling shore leave but look we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus iii
the klingon the romulan the federation consuls now i know enterprise is not exactly up to specs
with all due respect the enterprise is a disaster there must be other ships in the quadrant
other ships yes but no experienced commanders captain i need jim kirk
have the klingons responded
no but you can bet they will
besides i cannot believe you would kill me for a field of empty holes
your pain runs deep
what do you know of my pain
where did you get this power
the power was within you
i feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart how can i repay you for this miracle
join my quest
a starship there are no starships on nimbus iii
perhaps i have a way to bring one here
but how
you told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks i gave you three what happened
i think you gave me too much time captain
very well mr scott carry on
do not you worry captain we will beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push
captain we cannot trust anyone now
head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right then left at the blowscreen you cannot miss it
she is got partial power sir i might be able to take two of you
why did not you beep my communicator
captain starfleet transmission on line
captain we are receiving the hostage information you requested
standard orbit mr sulu
captain we are receiving transmission from paradise city they are demanding to know our intentions
respond with static let them think we are having difficulty which would not be far from the truth
paradise city can you boost your power we are barely receiving transmission
bird of prey bearing one zero five mark two
spock  what are you doing in this neck of the woods
and that is
because it is there
concentration is vital you must be one with the rock
oh god
oh no it is not that i knew i would not die because the two of you were with me
i do not understand
what are you doing
pack up your troubles
row row row your boat i love row  do  do you know row row row row row your boat
come on spock why did not you jump in
yes spock
life is not a dream
go to sleep spock
yes captain
goodnight spock
not general korrd
what is it you look like you have seen a ghost
spock what is it do you know this vulcan
i cannot be certain
but he does seem familiar
i do not often think of the past
what do you mean
klingon vessel now entering quadrant bird of prey estimating 19 hours until her weapons come to bear
their equipment is primitive but effective i recommend we land at coordinate 8563
that puts us pretty far away from paradise city
to land any closer would risk detection
at footspeed i estimate the journey to paradise city at 12 hours
yes captain
be one with the horse
exactly 155 seconds
you must allow us to act
damnit spock god damnit
captain what have i done 
what you have done is betray every man on this ship
worse i have betrayed you i do not expect you to forgive me
forgive you i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass
you stay out of this  why spock why i all you had to do was pull the trigger
if i had pulled the trigger sybok would be dead
i ordered you to defend this ship
you ordered me to kill my brother
look the man may be a fellow vulcan but that does not
you mean he is your brother brother  you made that up
technically you are correct i do not have a brother
there you see see
i have a half brother
exactly that is correct sybok's mother was a vulcan princess upon her death sybok and i were raised as brothers
why did not you tell me this before
i was not disposed to discuss matters of a personal nature for that i am sorry
there's got to be a way out of this place
this is a new brig captain it is escapeproof
how do you know
is it possible
is what possible
i am here captain
you are right i am a little out of practice  uhthat is an s
a t
new word b a um
there is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room
it would appear we are too heavy
spock the booster rockets
if i activate them now captain we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate
mark two
spock do not
what is this
spock i thought i was going to die
maybe he is not out there bones maybe he is right here in the human heart  spock
i was thinking of sybok i have lost a brother
i must have your starship
who are you
we must change our course at once
i trust your message was received
spock  what have you done to my friends
no i did not
now learn something about yourself
wait  you know we will never make it through the great barrier
but if we do will that convince you that my vision was true
your vision
given to me by god  he waits for us on the other side
you are mad
about the ship
the ship needs its captain
no special conditions
no conditions
what makes you think i will not turn us around
what have i done
borgus frat
let's see what she is got said the captain and then we found out did not we
i know you will whip her into shape scotty you always do
uhura i thought you were on leave
and i thought we were supposed to be going together
oh i cannot leave her now when she needs me the most
they cannot be serious the ship's in pieces and we have less than a skeleton aboard
easy easy  easy scotty easy you are back with us
uhura i had the strangest dream i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise
scotty dear he' not a madman
he is not
spock you have developed a sense of humor after all
i am a starfleet officer
sybok you must surrender
put him in the brig with captain kirk  spock you will accompany me to the bridge
no i will not
each mangs pain is unique
i hide no pain
i know you better than that
i cannot go with you
why not
i belong here
sybok  this is not the god of sha ka ree  or any other god
this is my doing this is my arrogance my vanity
sybok we must find a way

it does not matter  he was there and he let it happen  he cannot take us in
you heard me  count it out
he cannot prove anything john  he cannot turn us in
i shot him
you killed him
he was going to take the money
thirtythousand that is all  we would have been free and clear  you did not have to kill him
you are crazy you know that you are fucked up
jesus grace  did you have to kill him

i know  he was to take the fucking money
you are tense  what are you all uptight about
is that the kind of girl you think i am  what can i do to make you relax
well nothing

now we dump jake split the money then you are on your own
but you said we could be together

i cannot make it  grace  grace
john  can you hear me  are you still there
where the hell am i going to go
john throw me the keys
what for
the trunk  it is locked
it is not locked  i left it open when i took out jake's body
it is    it is locked

i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up
bullshit grace  you were going to drive off and leave me here
no  i swear it
and you are not one to lie are you
throw me the keys and i will pull you up
someone will find me
yeah they will find you  dried up and twice dead
you idiot  you will kill us both
at least i will have company when i die  ai not that right jake
for christ's sake john  throw me the keys
what do you say jake  should we trust her  no  i did not think so
who the hell are you
did not much look like you were hanging drapes
i swear to you that is all that happened  i have not so much as set foot in your bedroom
a lot that means
you have got to be
yeah i know  more careful
i guess we have never been introduced proper  jake mckenna
jake mckenna  that is a solid name
i am a solid man
john stewart
what brings you to sierra
my car overheated  i pulled in to have it fixed
where you headed
i have got to make a stop in vegas then i am heading to santa barbara
live there
wait a second
like you do not know
would you
would i what
i am not a murderer mr mckenna
how do you know if you have never tried
good lord  what happened to you
just ran into a little trouble
i am surprised to see you  i thought you would be halfway to vegas by now
i had a problem getting my car back
now what can i do for you
i was hoping we could talk
talk  about what
about things  about your wife
sweet grace  what about her
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife  fiftythousand dollars
i do
you said you would cut that up with the man who did her in
i think this heat's getting to you the way you are rambling on
i am not rambling
you are talking like a mad man
you are the one who brought it up this morning  in your car
that was just loose talk  i do not want anybody dead
bullshit  you wanted me to kill her
a man does not always mean the things he says
you meant it
and what does that make you
let's say i do want her dead  what is it you want  this morning you were not a killer
this morning i did not know how badly i would want to get out of this fucking town
and for that you would kill grace
for that i would kill a nun on easter sunday
just to get out of here  that does not seem much for a murder
how do you put a price on murder
i put it at fiftythousand dollars minus your cut of course  which is
how much could you get
maybe    tenthousand  and that is a maybe
i need thirteen
do we shake hands
you want to do this yourself  i do not have to do this you know
this is what you do  go to the house to see her
i went to your place  we talked just like you told me  we drove out into the desert   
you did not kill her
you know so much about killing why do not you do it yourself
i guess i have what you would call a lovehate relationship with grace
shut up
came close this time and it scares you
drop it jake
and next time next time somebody is going to get dead
jake how much were you going to pay me to do the job
thirteenthousand dollars  had you done it  is not that what we agreed on
you think that is a lot of money
all i have in the world
yeah well me too
trouble with the car again
you could say  i do not even have it yet
darrell giving you problems
it is not like that
maybe you heard old jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you would help yourself to a little
that is not the reason i am here  i swear it
there's another reason  it better be good
i came for grace
you came to take my wife from me
it is the truth jake
i am curious about something  i am wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at
nothing happened with me and grace this morning
then maybe this afternoon  when i sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead
you are not talking sense
sense  if i had any sense i would have killed you this morning and been done with it
twohundred dollars
i asked you a question
honest toby  i just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox
i want to stay
what happened to your hand
accident and yeah i got to be more careful
got any requests
that country shit all sounds the same to me
she is dead
gee that is sad  do not that make you sad
i have had time to get over it
you ai not from oz  oz is in that one movie
hey mister  mister  i just   i just wanted to thank you
for what
for defending my honor this afternoon
i hate to bust your bubble but i was not defending you
but you was going to fight for me
what the hell are you talking about

you expect me to believe that
i do not care what you believe as long as you leave me alone

i suppose boyd is the creative force behind all this

why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality
what are you talking about
i am talking about the kind of people you hang out withabout growing up assuming responsibility of yourself

what michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand
but i could understand i want to understand

yuheeyah  yuheeyah no way busters use it in a sentence

just sit there and soak up the vitamin d
doctor's orders  
far from it michael do not put me up there
all i meant was 
christ michael  what the hell are we doing  we do not even know 
is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is
seems more like a year than a month
i called dr styles at the neurological institute  in la remember  he said he would see you  he was intrigned
god knows i am intriguing
we are quite a pair you and i

michael  i saw him  twice  carlotta said i    killed graham  with  with my anger
c'mon  let's go to the ho
even if it is all true  that does not make you a witch it is 1992 rowan
do you love me michael

it would take mounths and cost a fortune
what about your work back home
i will bet she had a wonderful smile

you are a very bad witch you know that
smoking is bad for your heart michael
you are just afraid i will drop dead before i finish the damn house

hey  i love gloves  i look really great in gloves
i thought it was 'whistle while you work

mikey  pregnant women get crazy you know that  i mean  hell they are all crazy anyway  right
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash
which do you think is her best shot
the one on the left  definitely
i have got a tenant coming over later  can i take the afternoon off
that is not technically accurate  simpsons murders were not sexually motivated
you know that circulation is down for three months in a row
oh my gawd
i am sorry  i did not think
sounds good  thank you
you see i am writing this article for chic magazine
its cramped in here is not it brian
yes it is
tell me brian what would happen if the client lost the key
then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
so there is only one key
that is right
yes i am sure you could  but i cannot risk you loosing your job
no it is no problem  i do it all the time
all the time
hello mrs steckler  we have not seen you for a long time
i should not say this  but you really remind me of someone i know
oh really  you must remember me from when i was a regular customer
i was not a manager here then mrs steckler  do not you remember

do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
how long have you been watching me
then why did you marry her 
tell me how it happened
why should i
my mother  i never knew my real mother  i was adopted
you think i killed my mother do not you
my sister  my adopted sister 
i want it to stop  it all to stop
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
that is wrong
what is it
you want me to wear white for you you must be madder than i thought
where are you going
we have got nothing to talk about
i thought we had a relationship built on trust  and you just slap me in the face
leslie  is that good enough
ellen would you like a cup  there's plenty in the pot
first finish your tea
why did you let him in
i do not like sugar
there is not that much  you did not even taste it  that is wrong  do not you like my tea
it is not that  i just do not want any sugar

it did give me a chance to meet you again ellen  it is all routine you understandso where were you

so she did not mention anything more about it
no  she is not in any trouble is she
oh no sir  just making some enquiriesjust tell her that inspector taylor called on you  she will understand
i should not really  i am not your surgeon
come on bro spare yourself the humiliation the degradation
i genuinely think she wants me i feel a vibe
see did you see that
were you always this sick
i defy your hamburger theory of life and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents
that is crazy talk
do not do it ted do not do it
think about itlong tunnel bright lights it is full of vaginal symbolism
nobody knows about your mental retardation
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation
nobody knows about your constant masturbation
who the hell was your father
a bouncer are you serious
this is the life baby we get ourselves some tail and we are talking spring break
cut it out before you break something
do not you know anything about limo etiquette everything in here is included for our pleasure
this is like my every wet dream come true  i do not even care that you are here too bro
i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight
this is not some 80's porno film you dip shit there are no wild sex orgies
oh well maybe not yet
you kiss your mother with that mouth
so far away in xenia
check this out  hurry
what is it now
do not tell me  another vision of incomparable beauty
then there must be a whole room made completely of chocolate
do not be such a pansy all of this is yours
i feel like i am entering a forbidden tomb
oh how inappropriate is that
take a whiff of heaven
how would you like it if i did that to your mother's panties
i would call you a sick twisted fuck but this is different  she was not your mother mother
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he is seen
you are late bro
sorry ginger got a little you know enthusiastic
you will never believe who's in there
i feel like i have just been hit by a mack truck
i thought i loved her
hell yes all hundred and seventeen of 'em
no leave one somebody's grandmother might want one
and while you are at it i will take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads
get them together
holy stinkers what were you thinking
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty we wanted to showcase women throughout the world
you got everything you ever wanted
naked girls wild sex video games no wonder it is called heaven
never say never
let me get this straight
if it is not straight by now son you probably should see a doctor
these are real live women
we do not generally feature blowup dolls in our magazine but hey if you think there's a market for it
what gives don corleone
we reinvented ourselves
new hushpuppies do not make a new man
you have obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers
that explains the emptiness that haunts me
not bad for a hack he has a future in yellow journalism
would not it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing
from your lips to god's ears
you go first
ladies first  i insist
teddy would you please please please take me to the prom
ted have you lost your mind
you like me i like you i guess it is pretty obvious to everyone
i do not like you we are just friends
but that smile
oh ted duh  i smile at everyone since i got my braces off
so that is a maybe
great jacket teddy bear
yeah you like
hi teddy bear
christy  you want to be in heaven
i thought i would be nervous but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed teddy bear
i do i mean yeah i do
i have to admit i am so totally turned on we should do it now
do it
i remember the first time you walked into mrs temple's class in 2nd grade blue gingham dress blond ponytail
which you pulled hard
remember dress up day  you and charlie lifting skirts during recess
i miss those days when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence
you have changed since second grade
i mean what do you think
you expect me to think at a time like this there is not a drop of blood in my brain
i was always too shy to admit how much i liked you
come on i was hamburger you were porterhouse
god you are so hot
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on tuesday morning
we cannot accept it  it is much too expensive right dear
sweetheart what is it
i always wanted craftsman tools he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors
ted we put a lot of love in our business
we wanted you and jimmy to have it someday something real and honest
but that does not make you the boss of everything son
we miss you we miss our son
we understand your disappointment teddy christy is a pretty sexy provocative voluptuous  weuhwe understand your disappointment
i remember spring break of my senior year  seems like a lifetime ago
dad please
grandpa was so strong back then working from the crack of dawn so proud of his peaches
remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you
you guys are my parents
of course we are
i guess
be a sport how bad could spring break in los angeles be
i guess we could go to disneyland or something
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood
like one of those national geographic specials with the topless chicks
whatever helps you cope
i guess it is better than having tribal patterns carved in my face
there ya go always remember focus on the peach
just say it dad
i know they were simple people but did this trip help your college fund at all
dad let's just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore including the bookstore
finally some gratitude
sorry i
it is okay you need me
i paid off the mortgage i ordered that winnebago you always wanted now you are ashamed of me
that is your dream not mine my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine
shut your pie hole jimmy
ii do not have the keys
you do know how to drive
i do not have much experience with auhstick
now release the brake and slide the stick into first gear
the first time can be awkward you just have to get on and try again
i do not even know if i should be doing this it is a very expensive car
it is your car these are all your cars
some of them have to be automatics
i am ted by the way i think i forgot to say that
i know  i am ginger miss april
the one with the horses
that is me
hey ted wanna go shopping
shopping really i should tell my friend
do not worry  he found the chocolate room
who exactly are you
what do you mean i am ted nelson
or do you have a taste for the good life ted it is in your blood
after graduationmaybe we could go away together
teddy i thought we were having a moment here
ted do something
what do you want me to do
this is humiliating we are being ejected from a prom
oh sweetheart we wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you
can you believe that was me
you are on the next plane home
you mean they knew who i was
my legacy
your parents would be crushed to think you were not happy with it
they are not my parents helen my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much
i understand
and the girl i love she hates heaven if i keep it she will never respect me
how are the hometown folks treating you back in xenia
well jay they have been exceptionally supportive
i am no stranger to the notion of philanthropy andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols
james what are you doing here
you can call me jimmy again sheryl petersen said james sounds too pretentious
sheryl petersen is what nine years old what does she know
she knew exactly where you were staying which you neglected to tell me your own brother
impressive this is bigger than our whole house
most places are jimmy
they say money cannot buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile
so what brings you here at his hour
my new bike
very funny
i came to ask permission to take custody of your room
my room
better view more spacious new carpet it is a nobrainer
it is not up to me
mom and dad said it is yours they seem to think you are coming home
if you could just sign right there
you want it in writing
are you kidding mom and dad discover i am gone and i will be doing hard time
you are a peach
he was my grandfather too
i meant biologically
that is just one example my reporting has made a difference
do not even tell me you are hot for miss titty pom poms over there
christy's a very talented journalist i see a pulitzer in her future
go ahead ask her to the prom get it over with
i have absolutely no intention
i tried to warn you william randolph she is got stiletto heels hidden in those keds
but you tripledogdared me
a few billion bucks and suddenly he is cromagnon man of the year
what is it william randolph your balls need scratching
your article sucked
ah ha it was so well hidden you did not even know it was there
i am trying to help
i am still better than you nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account
local boy inherits more money than god call me crazy but i smell human interest
i have to admit i always felt different
different how different like a dwarf at a basketball game or different like a lesbian in pumps
i do not get the distinction
could everybody else tell you were different or were you the only one who knew
i felt limited i felt confined i felt like i was suffocating
i see so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist
she said peanuts you cretin
do not write that part
is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release
write what you want just try not to make it so obvious that you are crazy about me
life must be peachy on planet ted
funny you should say peachy
i did my homework your grandfather was a peach farmer
my adoptive grandfather who knows what my biological grandfather did
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted
well what do you think of her
you are so twitterpated you do not even see the miner's hat and the pickax
charlie's right jealousy is so unattractive
second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit
why cannot you be nice to me
wowyou clean up nice
where are we going
i cannot believe your dad built this for you
not whatever  it is two different things
he cared enough to want you to have it
he phoned it in
i see
your dad taught you everything
i mean my father
a father is nothing but sperm ted it takes a real man to be a dad
it is all so complicated
eventually you will let go
and then what
then you will see who's really holding on to you
you are amazing
i know
even when you infuriate me i still want to kiss you
but you never do
cut to the chase william randolph your audience is way ahead of you
there's gotta be something we have to dig deeper
you forget i dislike you at least as much as him
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade i am honing my craft
that is probably my office
well where the hell are you
he is on the move
i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati
i do not know this place seems pretty tame
you expected whips chains merk being cattleprodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood
at least it is not another 4h meeting or a big brother barbecue
i am trembling with excitement
that has more to do with your proximity to me
my desire betrays me like goosebumps on my flesh
i have a bit of a goosebump fetish not many people know that
i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy
shoes if you want to know the truth shoes are my thing
wearing them  or humping them
my fantasy is a totally naked woman wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs
that is refreshingly deviant
what about you
i am very aural
tell me more
sounds voices music humming all of it can turn me on or off like a switch
i see
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me
a portuguese boyfriend sounds very cosmo
you live and learn i realized the most important thing to me above all is trust
turned out to be a scoundrel eh i saw that one coming
do you trust me julie
not a chance
come on
i want you to trust me
that is hard to believe
i have to be honest with you ted i really despise the girls of xenia
i know their small town mentality can be maddening
i mean your pictorial it bothers me profoundly
you are telling me you do not get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts
you have seen one naked breast you have seem them all
which explains the continued success of heaven for how many decades

the thing is i made a commitment i said i would do it and i have to keep my word
julie wow i was afraid you left i was afraid i would never see you again
i am not going anywhere ted you are the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams
and i thought maybe i would take up boating i have always wanted to be a coxswain
very ambitious i like that
the thing is i will need a first mate

i was thinking antigua maybe

merritt forensics
the teeth doing any talking
ray  stop calling  i told you the dental records will take time
what about the blood
could be hers  types match  could be a lot of other people's too
you come all the way out here to watch walter
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions
about suzie
actually i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette
got sort of hung up on her from what hear
and the child
she had it before she drank herself to death  was not exactly a love child
so suzie and sandra van ryan were half sisters
you okay
how are you kelly would you like to take a break for a minute
i just want to get it over with  my mom's making me do this i just want to forget it
the next thing his hand was in my shorts you know from behind  his fingers his fingers
take your time
they were in me  both places you know
was there penetration  did he put himself inside you
did you try to fight him
i he had my wrists pinned behind me i remember my hands were cold'
then what
he kept saying let it happen let it happen  then he just stopped
and when you turned her toward the door where did you expect her to go without a car
is not that against the law peeking into windows
maybe she used another name
i do not know what to say
i have got that two o'clock in town
you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay
that is what they called it when i was in juvenile  it is a pretty dismal place
you saw the news today
unless what
eliminate the competition
where would you come up with this stuff anyway
guess i kind of lost it there
it is starting gloria  this is how it begins
i am gonna take you back to the office will you put out a call on suzie's car for me
if you want company
two kids could have gotten into a fight lost a couple of teeth
those are suzie toller's teeth
her grandmother said she would been threatening to run away  and i found the car at the miami bus terminal
poor dumb suzie she never had a chance
will you do me one favor
stick with me on this gloria  i need you
and if the teeth are not suzie's  you will give this up
i am tired ray  i am going home
where is lombardo
he is leaving the country  and i do not give a shit
that bothers you
yeah maybe a little
about a year ago
did he come in with you
at that point were you able to fight him off
he did say something
what was that
i want a fullscale investigation
you know what that will mean for lombardo
or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for
not that stuff about her running away him trying to find her  that is bullshit
what about witnesses
we have got three  guy mowing his yard couple of kids playing hoops
are you crazy ray
just tell us what happened
i told her i was coming with her  she nodded like she understood  we stood up together
the teeth were they
you guess  did he or did not he
yeah okay he did
and then what he touched you  did you maybe flirt a little
what did you do then
shit what difference does it make nobody's gonna believe me anyway
suzie  did this man rape you
he pushed into me i could not stop him it hurt
ms toller
i said he did
this was not my idea
thank you jimmy
a ride  you want one
it is those rocks up there
you and suzie used to come out here together
yeah sometimes  lots of the kids hang out here  you really think something bad happened to suzie
i say something funny
no  but i mean just the idea that mr lombardo would
way i hear it he was pretty tight with the kids one of the guys
i cannot believe you called sam  that is the matter with you
i am scared that is what  i am scared there's no one to trust
you are gonna fuck me over are not you
oh for christ's sake
you are
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain
i thought we were going to a movie
is there some reason why you are here
curiosity i guess
excuse me
the thing about it is threesomes so rarely work out
am i right did sam sell you on the idea right up front of whacking suzie that is murder kelly
get off my property
is that sam lombardo
hi mon
which one of your bodyguards is that
okay that is the matter
my friends buy me clothes so i do not look like trash
i would hardly say you look like trash
kelly  what is it
i miss dad
jesus  well i do too sometimes
he sam lombardo
you did not have to fly back  from  wherever for me
i am here to congratulate my friends and their children  i am leaving again tonight

jeez that thing cannot you
jesus christ what are you doing
how much
god you scared the shit out of me  you must be crazy coming here
from now on if we are seen together it is got to be accidental  i thought that was understood
the only way we are gonna blow this now is if we do it ourselves
do it to ourselves
shit  i was afraid of that  she left this garbled message on my machine  can you calm her down
you know what it takes
i am sorry kelly  i am sorry it had to happen like this  she was losing it
i am really serious  that cop he keeps watching me
yeah he got her busted for possession
i do not know i think it was something else suzie says the bust was bullshit
and you believe her
that never seemed to worry you at the glades
that is not your line
say you love me
i love you  now give me the line
i am running away
you think that is wise
good thinking
you can tie whoever did it to sandra van ryan
forget it
cannot you take that stupid thing off
i just want my life back
you will get over it we have got a knockdown airtight motherfucker of a lawsuit against sandra van ryan
just like that
you are saying that kelly was raped by sam lombardo
who is it
where is she
where she lives  in the guest house now will you tell me what this is about
i am placing your daughter under arrest
meet my partner gloria perez
it is celine  he is okay  he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are
will they
it does not look like it
you ought to watch it with that shit suzie  you get busted again you go back in a twotine loser
yeah they are bad for your health  i am trying to look out for you
that is cop bullshit
well you are half right  best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me
about what
every triangle i have ever seen never lasts  somebody's got to go
is this supposed to mean something to me  what triangle
you kelly sam
is that what you think  you have friends  is that what they told you
you i should have killed you myself should never have left it up to him
sam for godsake
why do not you tell us one more time how kelly came to be with you alone in your house
i had to go look for this coupon
and she began to cry  and you put an arm around her
but she ran away
but you do admit to touching her to putting your arm around her  is not that against the rules
it is and i do not  ordinarily  but i mean there's this kid standing in front of you crying
fuck you  this is bullshit  i am outta here
yeah well you fixed that  what the hell happened anyway
you mean this thing
yes we call it a winch  and these are shrouds and these are stays
