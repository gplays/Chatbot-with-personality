we should have seen land
we left three weeks ago alonso cannot be that near
you say asia can be found by sailing west
yes your eminence the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ are you familiar with the work of aristotle erathostene ptolemeus
your life and that of others
is that all that interests you gold
if god intended our proximity to asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world
do not you realize your words could be considered heretical
asia can be found to the west and i will prove it
the state has some reason to be interested in this man s proposition your eminence
the judgment is ours
it will not be easy to get rid of your prophet now don sanchez
you can see for yourself
what a tragedy what a waste of a life
i could be gone for years

i remind you senor colon that you are in no position to bargain with me
i am not bargaining
and were you never ambitious excellency or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles a fault for the rest of us
you defend yourself admirably
but we do have a lack of notaries you should contact my administration
don bobadilla is already a judge my dear don cristobal
you seem to have a special talent for making friends
what do i have so many already
all i have to do is call the guards
i am not afraid of you you are nothing but a dreamer
what do you see
roofs towers palaces spires

diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious brothers should be raised together colon even brothers from different mothers

how can you be so certain the ocean is said to be infinite
ignorance i believe the indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the canary islands

the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr esdras
esdras is a jew
two minutes and already you are a dead man do not let passion overwhelm you colon
i will try to remember that marchena
father marchena
passion is something one cannot control
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted
i have been contradicted all my life eternity
you must not give way to despair you must wait
wait i have waited seven years already how much longer do you want me to wait
if god intends you to go then you will go
all of them just lies
in nomine patris et filius et spiritus sancti
i am listening my son
father i have betrayed my family i betrayed my men and i betrayed you
what are you saying
i lied the journey will be longer than i said
how long

my son my son your certitudes are sometimes frightening christopher you must speak to them and if you do not i will
i believed in you
i suppose we are both old men now
i have to disagree
i knew you would
new worlds create new people
oh so you are a new man
the ocean is uncrossable
what did they say about granada before today
i cannot ignore the verdict of my council
may i speak freely
how old are you senor colon
do they have such thoughts
but without your brothers nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies you may explore the continent
thank you
there is one thing i would like to understand why do you want to go back after all this
and you say this is an indian vice by god i do not see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin
we lost cousins friends we will wash this in blood
you want a war fine we are a thousand they outnumber us by ten who will you kill which tribe
we cannot raise the wheel without it
don moxica we all have to work
due west captain mendez and may god be with us
well it is the men sir they wonder how you know our position we have lost sight from land days ago
and what do you think mendez
well i surely know what a quadrant is but i have never seen it used at night before
what do you read
that is he doing
he is drawing an isthmus he is saying we are on an isthmus
you lied you cheated we are way past 750 leagues
six days ago yes
you must be mad
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive
we are on the verge of a mutiny colon
you think i do not know that
we are lost
the land is there i know it
you do not know anything listen colon these are my ships right so i am telling you we are turning back
and then what half of the water has gone the rest is nearly putrid you know that
jesus maria i should have never listened to you
you never did you did all the talking for both of us remember
you bloody
pinzon pinzon all we can do now is go forward think about that
you tell that to them
is that the man i knew treasurer sanchez
you were right don sanchez his demands could never be granted
into a monk
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying but with no gold the new world proves expensive your majesty
but there is worse he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility
then what do you suggest don sanchez
he must be replaced
i know i should not tolerate his impertinence
then why

what are you laughing about
the case with the stones where is it

zorg jean baptiste emmanuel zorg nice to see you again
i remember you now the so called art dealer
i am glad you got your memory back father because you are going to need it where are the stones
why on earth do the stones interest you
personally they are of no interest to me i would rather sell weapons but i have a customer so tell me
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you
why that is wrong with me
i am a priest i am here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it
would you like a drink
no thank you
father by creating a little destruction i am in fact encouraging life so in reality you and i are in the same business
destroying a glass is one thing killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another
you are a monster zorg
excuse me i am looking for a priest
she is not my bride she is my fare she is looking for this vito cornelius according to the phone guide he lives here
that is me but i do not know who she is where did you find her
who are you
i brought the girl remember
he is a she
so you do know her
they all like this in your family father
she is an exception
thank you so much for your help mr
yes that is fine thank you very much a thousand times over
i might call to check up on her you know to see if she is better
she is fine really do not you worry just needs some rest she is had a very long trip
excuse me just one thing she said something to me a while ago and i do not really get it akta gamat
it means never without my permission
is that the usual way priests go on vacation
we are not going on vacation we are on a mission
what kind of mission
we have to save the world
good luck
what are you doing
you are probably very angry with me and i quite understand but i want you to know i am fighting for a noble cause
yeah i know to save the world but right now all i want to do is save leeloo
leeloo s in trouble
when is she not in trouble
there s no light you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light
yes of course but the stones are shut they have to be open for it to work
and you do not know how they open is that what you are saying
your theory is interesting father but i do not think we have time to go into it right now
we have forty eight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
is there anything that can stop it
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here
what are we going to do
it is a miracle
what is
father will you please explain that is going on
father you sure she is the supreme being
that is she doing
uh father i know she is been through a lot but the sacred stones we do not have much time
i got it everything here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel
where is leeloo
on the plane with mr dallas the real one
you are all safe thanks be to god
leeloo is she is
yes and more than that you must give her the stones she is the only one who knows how to use them
i will help her i promise but i think you should tell me where the stones are
do you love her
i i do not know we hardly know each other it takes time
i do not have time i need to know
listen the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her i never saw her again
i am sorry but the stones
i love you too major but you have not called me that since basic training

is there any danger some kind of virus
this thing solid

i have never used the word insane ted
what word would you use elaine
the word is sick ted very very very sick

i would use the word insane
there s something dangerously wrong with this ship elaine i know its the wiring that toilet s just the tip of the iceberg
elaine that is going on
elaine i am going back there just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can
ted we have only got ten minutes

you mean
that is right premature ejection
what will happen to him ted

you can eat balanced meals exercise and take geritol
i mean for ted

i am getting over it if a relationship is not working you cannot force it
do you want to talk about it
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me
no i mean your relationship
we were in love but i am not sure i know what love is anymore
love s the same as it always was it is people who change
people change in relation to each other love changes on its own
not if the people change together in relation to that love
sure but that is only when the love itself goes unchanged
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there s change in the two people who share that love
no it is hard to l a u g h when your father s dying
someone dead from this household
my brother and nephew perished two days ago when their hay cart turned over
we will sleep here tonight you will come home with me we will let the house and the lands too plenty of willing neighbors
i do not want to leave
did the priest say anything about the resurrection or was it all about judgment
what are they doing
but what will you do
i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground
a thousand you have made me guardian of scotland so i tell you this is what we face
we cannot defeat this
with cavalry not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ we could outmaneuver their bowmen
sir william we come to seek a meeting
young robert we are honored
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes
does anyone know his politics
may he rest in peace you have already sealed the coffin
he was a modest man
if i pay homage to another s throne then how am i a king
homage is nothing it is the crown that matters
he will not come
longshanks promised
scottish rebels have routed lord bottoms
what news of the north
wallace has sacked york
the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself
now we kill two birds at one stroke we recruit from scotland for our armies in france
the scots will fight for us
what choice do they have now they must serve us or starve
his legend grows it will be worse than before
what is it
you directed me to report to you the moment the king s conference was ended
so i did and what was so important about it
shut up would you how can i concentrate
his majesty was quite keen that you should understand
no m lord
now my flower do you understand
yes i had thought that i was loathsome to you perhaps i am if i may be excused m lord
good day to you m lords
you mock us with a smile
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion
when will his trial be
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace
you fancy him
nor you to you that word is as unfamiliar as love
i will wait back there
the bruce is not coming william
thanks for the food and drink and for bringing em yourselves
rest william
i rest
you know it is a trap
probably but we cannot win alone we know that this is the only way
that is just a dream william
we have lived a dream together a dream of freedom

they are coming
how many
they are english soldiers ai not they
with your father and brother gone they will kill us and burn the farm
wanna stay with me tonight
i wanna have supper waitin
we will get those english pigs tomorrow
test of manhood
you win
call it a test of soldiery then the english will not let us train with weapons so we train with stones
i still say this is no test a catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can
can you do it when it matters as it matters in battle could you crush a man with that throw
you will move
good to see you again
all right father i will ask him if i risk my neck for you will i get a chance to kill englishmen
a common thief
we must run in different directions
we do not split up
i am the one who is rotting but i think your face looks graver than mine
he was so brave with courage alone he nearly won
so more men were slaughtered uselessly
in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break
where is my son
i sent for him and the little coward send you
shall i leave m lord
my son s loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen so he accepted our bribe
no he did not
then why does he stay my scouts say he has not advanced
he waits for you he says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him
you spoke with this wallace in private what kind of man is he
a mindless barbarian not a king like you m lord
the scottish nobles have sent him no support his army starves our stall has worked he must withdraw you may return to your embroidery
no i have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war
this is what happens when you must send a woman and a fool
forgive me sire i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule
i have faced him have you
let her speak
treason against whom
against thy king thou vile fool hast thou anything to say
never in my whole life did i swear allegiance to your king
it matters not he is thy king
while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times i cannot commit treason if i have never been his subject
confess and you may receive a quick death deny and you must be purified by pain do you confess do you confess
i do not confess
your father does not like me does he
it is not you he dislikes that you are a wallace he just says the wallaces do not seem to live for very long
thank you for accepting
thank you for inviting
i will invite you again but your mother thinks i am crazy
did it work
i want to marry you
i accept your proposal
i am not just saying it
nor i
but i will not give you up to any nobleman
you scare me
i do not want to scare you i want to be yours and you mine every night like this one
this night is too beautiful to have again
i have missed you
shush it is only been a day and it is seemed like forever
tonight then
i am dreaming
yes you are and you must wake
i do not want to wake i want to stay with you
and i with you but you must wake
i need you so much i love you
when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes scotland is in chaos your husband is secretly sending an army north
how do you know this
last night i slept with a member of the war council
he should not be telling secrets in bed
i am the princess of wales
i come as the king s servant and with his authority
it is battle i want not talk
i understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight
i have been given nothing god makes men what they are
a lordship and gold that i should become judas
peace is made is such ways
a meeting in a barn it had to be a trap and only you would know i would be aware of it
why did you
i cannot love you for the sake of revenge
m lady what kindness of you to visit a stranger
sir i come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy
will he show mercy to my country will he take back his soldiers and let us rule ourselves
mercy is to die quickly perhaps even live in the tower in time who knows what can happen if you can only live
you will die it will be awful
drink this it will dull your pain
it will numb my wits and i must have them all if i am senseless or if i wail then longshanks will have broken me
wait i respect what you said but remember these men have lands castles much to risk
i must consult with my father
we cannot stop
they have tricked us
that is the crazy man saying lord
the dogs have a scent my scent someone must have given it to them
i thought i was dead when ya pulled that dagger
fine speech now what do we do
come it will help you sleep
how did you get in here you are under age
i came with captain renault

now just a minute who told you to ask me that
he did captain renault did
i thought so where is your husband
yes i will bet
he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
does he know that
oh yes
and he is still willing to give you a visa

monsieur rick i
you will find a market there for this ring i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice
thank you but i hardly think

maybe i will not have to a bribe has worked before in the meantime everybody stays on salary
now you finish locking up will you carl
i will then i am going to the meeting of the
do not tell me where you are going
the police break up our meeting herr rick we escaped in the last moment
yes i come
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance it might attract the police
but sacha always puts out that light
tonight he forgot
i want you to take miss lund home
excuse me monsieur rick but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs the cashier would like some money
well i will get it from the safe
i am so upset monsieur rick you know i cannot understand
forget it emil mistakes like that happen all the time
here you are
it shall not happen again monsieur
here s to you sir
er good luck yes
i would better be going
er my check please
er goodbye sir
hello rick
hello ferrari how is business at the blue parrot
fine but i would like to buy your cafe
it is not for sale
you have not heard my offer
it is not for sale at any price
what do you want for sam
suppose you run your business and let me run mine
suppose we ask sam maybe he would like to make a change
suppose we do
i see the bus is in i will take my shipment with me
no hurry i will have it sent over have a drink with me
i never drink in the morning and every time you send my shipment over it is always just a little bit short
the bourbon the news about ugarte upset me very much
of course not what upsets me is the fact that ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are
practically no one
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
and the carrying charges
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
i will tell him when he comes in
rick i will put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
that is why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place
shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough
ah to get out of casablanca and go to america you are a lucky man
oh by the way my agreement with sam s always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits that still goes
hmmm i happen to know that he gets ten percent but he is worth twenty five
and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i do not sell
of course they stay rick s would not be rick s without them
do not forget you owe rick s a hundred cartons of american cigarettes
i will stay here and keep on trying i am sure in a little while
we have decided signor ferrari for the present we will go on looking for two exit visas thank you very much
yes something
do you know where they are
he is a difficult customer that rick one never knows what he will do or why but it is worth a chance
it was gracious of you to share it with me good day mademoiselle monsieur
and mademoiselle
mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
that is also true except for one destination to return to occupied france
occupied france
uh huh under a safe conduct from me
what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
there are only two other alternatives for him
what are they
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
and the other alternative
it was la belle aurore
how nice you remembered but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris
i remember every detail the germans wore gray you wore blue
say goodnight to sam for me
i will
there s still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam
who are you really and what were you before what did you do and what did you think huh
we said no questions
a franc for your thoughts
in america they would bring only a penny i guess that is about all they are worth
i am willing to be overcharged tell me
why i am so lucky why i should find you waiting for me to come along
why there is no other man in my life
uh huh
that is easy there was he is dead
i am sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions
richard they will find out your record it will not be safe for you here
my german s a little rusty
with the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love
yeah it is pretty bad timing where were you say ten years ago
ten years ago let s see yes i was having a brace put on my teeth where were you
was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding
strange i know so very little about you
but be serious darling you are in danger and you must leave paris
no no no no we must leave
yes of course we
oh i saved my first drink to have with you here
no no rick not tonight
why did you have to come to casablanca there are other places
please do not do not rick i can understand how you feel
huh you understand how i feel how long was it we had honey
can i tell you a story rick
has it got a wow finish
i do not know the finish yet
i am sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night
well you can tell me now i am reasonably sober
i do not think i will rick
all the same someday you will lie to laszlo you will be there
how did you get in
i told you this morning you would come around but this is a little ahead of schedule well will not you sit down
richard i had to see you
you can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters
i went through all that with your husband it is no deal
i know how you feel about me but i am asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause he is fighting for
it was your cause too in your own way you were fighting for the same thing
richard richard we loved each other once if those days meant anything at all to you
i would not bring up paris if i were you it is poor salesmanship
please please listen to me if you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth
all right i tried to reason with you i tried everything now i want those letters get them for me
i do not have to i have got them right here
for the last time put them on the table
huh but it is still a story without an ending what about now
now i do not know i know that i will never have the strength to leave you again
all right i will here s looking at you kid
richard victor thinks i am leaving with him have not you told him
no not yet
but it is all right is not it you were able to arrange everything
everything is quite all right
but why my name richard
because you are getting on that plane
i do not understand what about you
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life
but what about us
we will always have paris we did not have we would lost it until you came to casablanca we got it back last night
hello sam
it is been a long time
yes ma am a lot of water under the bridge
some of the old songs sam
where is rick
when will he be back
not tonight no more he ai not coming uh he went home
does he always leave so early
oh he never well he is got a girl up at the blue parrot he goes up there all the time
you used to be a much better liar sam
leave him alone miss ilsa you are bad luck to him
play it once sam for old time s sake
i do not know what you mean miss ilsa
play it sam play as time goes by
victor i i feel somehow we should not stay here
you are very kind
this time they really mean to stop me
victor i am afraid for you
i must find out what berger knows
be careful
we are only interested in two visas signor
please ilsa do not be hasty
no ilsa i will not let you stay here you must get to america and believe me somehow i will get out and join you
but victor if the situation were different if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it
he does could we have a table close to him
what happened with rick
our faithful friend is still there
victor please do not go to the underground meeting tonight
whatever i would say you would carry on victor why do not you tell me about rick what did you find out
did he give any reason
he suggested i ask you
ask me
yes victor i was
i know how it is to be lonely is there anything you wish to tell me
no victor there is not
yes yes i know victor whatever i do will you believe that i that
be careful
are you ready ilsa
he came from paris with rick
rick who s he
mademoiselle you are in rick s and rick is
hello rick
well then perhaps you also
i cannot get over you two she was asking about you earlier rick in a way that made me extremely jealous
i am afraid major strasser would insist
how do you do
how do you do
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
and about victor laszlo everywhere
and i congratulate you
what for
your work
thank you i try
i hope we did not overstay our welcome
we will come again
good morning
good evening
good evening you see here we are again
monsieur blaine i wonder if i could talk to you
go ahead
well is not there some other place it is rather confidential what i have to say
i am not interested in politics the problems of the world are not in my department i am a saloon keeper
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record you ran guns to ethiopia you fought against the fascists in spain
what of it
is not it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs
i appreciate it but i do not accept it
i will raise it to two hundred thousand
my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
there must be some reason why you will not let me have them
there is i suggest that you ask your wife
i beg your pardon
i said ask your wife
well this might come in handy
thank you
had a close one eh
do not you sometimes wonder if it is worth all this i mean what you are fighting for
we might as well question why we breathe if we stop breathing we will die if we stop fighting our enemies the world will die
i wonder if you do i wonder if you know that you are trying to escape from yourself and that you will never succeed
you love her that much
monsieur blaine i do not know how to thank you
i brought the money monsieur blaine
keep it you will need it in america
but we made a deal
oh never mind about that you will not have any trouble in lisbon will you
no it is all arranged
everything in order
all except one thing there s something you should know before you leave
monsieur blaine i do not ask you to explain anything
i understand
i am captain renault prefect of police
yes what is it you want
no captain please
let us say that it is my request that is a much more pleasant word
my bill
well a precedent is being broken er emil
ricky you are becoming quite human i suppose we have to thank you for that mademoiselle
tomorrow at ten at the prefect s office
i am delighted to see you both did you have a good night s rest
i slept very well
that is strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca
may we proceed with the business
with pleasure will not you sit down
i am afraid not my regrets monsieur
and the honor of having served the third reich
monsieur insofar as it is in my power
thank you
i believe you have a message for him
i am making out the report now we have not quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape
i am sure you will excuse me if i am not gracious but you see major strasser i am a czechoslovakian
i have never accepted that privilege and i am now on french soil
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
this is hardly the time or the place
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefect s office with mademoiselle
and that is
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris in prague in brussels in amsterdam in oslo in belgrade in athens
even in berlin
for the time being
unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca
thank you captain it is very good to be here
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm major
oh we germans must get used to all climates from russia to the sahara but perhaps you were not referring to the weather
what else my dear major
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
oh there is no hurry tonight he will be at rick s everybody comes to rick s
good evening gentlemen
thank you it is a pleasure to have you here major
champagne and a tin of caviar
may i recommend veuve cliquot 26 a good french wine
especially so tonight major in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers
rick this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others
well personally major i will take what comes
ho diplomatist
rick is completely neutral about everything and that takes in the field of women too
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr blaine i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly
if rick has the letters he is much too smart to let you find them there
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that he is just another blundering american
as to laszlo we want him watched twenty four hours a day
you see captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe
captain renault are you entirely certain which side you are on
i have no conviction if that is what you mean i blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy
a leader like laszlo
uh huh i have been thinking it is too dangerous if we let him go it may be too dangerous if we let him stay
but everybody s having such a good time
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
but i have no excuse to close it
what is the meaning of that phone call
why do you stand here why do not you stop him
hello louis
you know i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh
the plane to lisbon you would like to be on it
why that is in lisbon
it was a combination of all three
and what in heaven s name brought you to casablanca
my health i came to casablanca for the waters
waters what waters we are in the desert
rick there s going to be some excitement here tonight we are going to make an arrest in your cafe
what again
if you are thinking of warning him do not put yourself out he cannot possibly escape
i stick my neck out for nobody
i see and that is strasser doing here he certainly did not come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency
how observant you are as a matter of fact i wanted to give you a word of advice
yeah that is his name
victor laszlo
rick that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed
well he is succeeded in impressing half the world
it is my duty to see that he does not impress the other half rick laszlo must never reach america he stays in casablanca
it will be interesting to see how he manages
manages what
his escape
oh but i just told you
stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
this is the end of the chase
is that a serious offer
i just paid out twenty i would like to get it back
done no matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or i should say two
why two
he is traveling with a lady
maybe he is not quite as romantic as you are
it does not matter there is no exit visa for him
louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
and got well paid for it on both occasions
the winning side would have paid you much better
maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
i have my orders
yeah you were saying
oh how do you do
that makes rick a citizen of the world
well you were asking about rick and here he is mademoiselle may i present
oh no rick never
oh it is my party
well ricky i am very pleased with you now you are beginning to live like a frenchman
louis are you pro vichy or free french
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
as i suspected you are a rank sentimentalist
yeah why
why do you interfere with my little romances
how can you close me up on what grounds
ricky i would advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo if by any chance you were to help him escape
well they are all excellent reasons
and i am taking a friend with me one you will appreciate
what friend
it certainly would germany vichy would be very grateful
i see how do i know you will keep your end of the bargain
i will make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor s pen
ricky i am going to miss you apparently you are the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i
oh thanks
you are late
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel so i knew i would be on time
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs
you know this place will never be the same without you ricky
yes i know what you mean but i have already spoken to ferrari you will still win at roulette
i have the letters right here
tell me when we searched the place where were they
sam s piano
not so fast louis nobody s going to be arrested not for a while yet
have you taken leave of your senses
i have sit down over there
i suppose you know what you are doing but i wonder if you realize what this means
i do we have got plenty of time to discuss that later
call off your watch dogs you said
just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them and remember this gun s pointed right at your heart
if you do not mind you fill in the names that will make it even more official
you think of everything do not you
well i was right you are a sentimentalist
well rick you are not only a sentimentalist but you have become a patriot
maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses
our expenses
uh huh
where were you last night
that is so long ago i do not remember
will i see you tonight
give me another
sacha she is had enough
rick i am sick and tired of having you
come on we are going to get your coat
make it official if you like
what is your nationality
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation
there seems to be no secret about that
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris
well there are certain sections of new york major that i would not advise you to try to invade
aha who do you think will win the war
my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one
in this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
you will excuse me gentlemen your business is politics mine is running a saloon
i would advise you not to interfere
put that phone down
get me the radio tower
uh excuse me please hello rick
huh you know rick watching you just now with the deutsches bank one would think you would been doing this all your life
well what makes you think i have not
oh nothing but when you first came to casablanca i thought
may i too bad about those two german couriers was not it
they got a lucky break yesterday they were just two german clerks today they are the honored dead
i forgot you never drink with i will have another please you despise me do not you
for a price ugarte for a price
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renault s price i get it for them for half is that so parasitic
i do not mind a parasite i object to a cut rate one
well rick after tonight i will be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca
who did you bribe for your visa renault or yourself
for how long
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
i do not want them here overnight
rick rick help me
do not be a fool you cannot get away
sam ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot
i like it fine here
he will double what i pay you
boss ai not you going to bed
well i ai not sleepy either
good then have a drink
no not me boss
then do not have a drink
boss let s get out of here
no sir i am waiting for a lady
please boss let s go ai not nothing but trouble for you here
she is coming back i know she is coming back
we will take the car and drive all night we will get drunk we will go fishing and stay away until she is gone
shut up and go home will you
they grab ugarte and she walks in well that is the way it goes one in one out sam
yeah boss
sam if it is december 1941 in casablanca what time is it in new york
uh my watch stopped
that is that you are playing
just a little something of my own
well stop it you know what i want to hear
no i do not
you played it for her and you can play it for me
well i do not think i can remember it
if she can stand it i can play it
this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied does not it mr richard
where is she have you seen her
mr merrick sugar
yes please two
one or two
and here is one of frederick s mother
they have noble faces
i have always thought that myself
you will not be long
did it go well darling
yes very well i think are the girls in bed
yes and they send their kisses would you like your sherry now
perhaps you are just polishing a stone endowing this elephant man with qualities he does not possess
and what qualities are those intelligence or stupidity
i am sorry i do not know either i just do not know
john loves the house
you stay with me
freddie that is the matter you have been like this all evening
oh i have just been thinking about something that man bytes said
oh freddie what could that wretched vampire say to upset you
frederick just what is it that you are saying
am i a good man or am i a bad man
i found it
our man is sick come right away
what is it
like this
you sly bastard you are doing this to spite me are not you
aw bytes he is sick
he is doing it to spite me i tell you and it is got to stop
he is sick bytes he is going to die
what are you going to do
do not
what did you do to him he is been like this all night
what do you mean
he was fine when he left here and now look at him
what happened
he fell he falls
he is a clumsy git never watches where he is going
why is he sitting up like this he needs rest
this man belongs in hospital
i like doing business with you you and i understand each other completely i know i can trust you cannot i
i want my man back
just a moment how did you get in here
never mind that i want my man
you misunderstood this man suffered a severe fall if you take my meaning he is my patient now and i must do what
pull the other one why do not you we made a deal
i know what you have done to him and he is never going back to that
he is a freak that is how they live we are partners him and i business partners you are willfully depriving me of my livlihood
you do not own this man
i want him back
so you can beat him so you can starve him a dog in the street would fare better with you
now i think we really do understand one another
good morning treves
good morning sir
you have acquired a taste for this
it is quite nutritious sir
no sir he is got bronchitis and he is been badly beaten
why is not he in the general ward then
well sir he is quite seriously deformed and i fear the other patients would find him rather shocking
deformed is that it then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable
yes sir
what are your plans then treves you are aware that the london does not accept incurables the rules are quite clear on that point
yes i am well aware of that but this case is quite exceptional
oh is he a friend of yours
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital
ah no sir i had planned to see them in the morning
a few words i thought he was imbecile
then will you meet him as a representative of the committee
singularly unpleasant chap uh i do not suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your patient mr treves
thank you very much sir shall we say in a few days then
shall we say two o clock tomorrow afternoon
wh whatever is most convenient for you sir
two o clock then you know treves it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance
oh yes
it was a nice try treves but the man is so obviously mouthing your words
how did you know the rest i never taught you the rest of it
i do not understand
treves well done
can you imagine what his life has been like
yes i think i can
you are quite right treves this is an exceptional case and i quite agree that the committee should see mr merrick
do you think they will go along with us
has the response picked up
frankly treves it is not what i would expected a few small cheques well wishers do not worry these things undoubtedly take time
but he is so afraid he is going to be carted off i have promised him that will not happen
well i will let you know if there s something in the afternoon post
do not you think this is a bit premature we do not have the backing yet to
how are you feeling today
i feel much better thank you for asking and you
i am feeling very fit thank you how is your bronchitis
i feel much better thank you
are you comfortable here
i everyone has been very kind to me
everyone has been very kind
what is it treves
it was a great pleasure to meet you mr merrick
i am very pleased to meet you
how long has this man been here
abominable things these machines one cannot reason with them
i say freddie what are you about
good lord freddie what have you got in there
you will know presently at the meeting of the society but until then i beg of you fox keep it to yourself
certainly if you insist you must have quite a find there
i do not know what i have got
pardonnez moi i cannot tell vat is like me
an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel
o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies
what say you fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits
good day
i have brought you some things i hope you will like mr merrick i hope you do not think it too forward
oh no
mr treves says that you are in the theatre do you live there
oh no mr merrick i just work there
well even to work there would be wonderful is it beautiful
you have never been
alas no
well you must go it is one of the most beautiful places on earth of course i am rather partial

i do not know the process dr weir was the expert
how is he
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement
to conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity anyone who can should get some sleep
he will live if we ever make it back
what is it
i have been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
they thought it said liberatis me save me but it is not me it is tutemet save yourself
it is not a distress call it is a warning
do you hear it right there
hear what
it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell
dj the clark s gone smith and cooper are dead
what happened
oh god dj what do i how do i
please kill
that is wrong
that is happening
that is wrong
90 over 50 and falling
intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood
his peritoneum has ruptured
you wanted to see me admiral
incredible these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this this happened this is not some kind of hoax
i would not bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and i would codes
thank you
it is not that simple lyle play the recording for dr weir
does he know that
that is on your mind
he does not belong on this mission responsible or not he blames himself he is too close to it and then there s his wife
it is been two years since she died he is over it
i want our best people on this where is miller
what justin what shows you
it will not stop it goes on and on and on
what does
it is inside and it eats and eats until there s nothing left
the dark inside i do not understand
how do you know all this
you have reached the first containment seal the engineering decks are on the other side
we still have pressure the radiation count s steady at 7 millirads an hour
i have reached another containment door this thing s huge
that is the second containment seal beyond that engineering
everything green on my boards skipper
justin finish your sweep
but i cannot i gotta get out of here skipper please
this is weir
since the initial transmission there s been no further contact just the beacon every two minutes
the crew could they still be alive
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months they are been gone seven years
that is the hold up
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers good for four months
we have got pressure
jesus its huge
that means they did not abandon ship
peters is right no one s here
i can see the hatch
the blood came from somewhere peters
okay i am on the bridge
everything s been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull it is intact
justin check the containment for radiation leaks peters
you okay
peters i want you to go through the ship s log see if we cannot find some answers
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up
peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us
captain miller i just want to say
i have been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space
where has it been for the last seven years
what does it say
that is the engineering containment and there s the main airlock we can dock there
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
dr weir i need you on the bridge
captain i did not come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
once the ship is secured we will bring you on board
you are in the central corridor it connects the personnel areas to engineering
easy peters we are okay we are okay let s finish the sweep
no one
it beats dying mister smith
hold on that is this gravitational distortion
it is possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core distorting space time they could be what hit the lewis and clark
what could cause them that is in the core
it is complicated
if it worked
i want this room sealed the second containment is off limits
there s no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields it is under control
you have something dr weir
the date
what about it
the event horizon s computer think s it is 2034
it is 2041
what the hell is that dr weir
we barely have enough power for life support as it is if we cannot stop the drain we are not gonna make it
we do not get the power back our air s gonna go bad
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
is that your expert opinion the only answer we have had out of you is i do not know
i want to know what caused that noise i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations
that is bullshit and you know it you built this fucking ship and all i have heard from you is bullshit
what do you want me to say
to what where did this ship go where did you send it
i do not know
where has it been for the past seven years
i do not know
the other place what is that
i do not know i do not know there s a lot of things going on here that i do not understand truth takes time
we are leaving
you cannot your orders are specific
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship the crew is dead dr weir this ship killed them and now it is killing us
do not do not do this
you you cannot do that
you cannot leave she will not let you
i told you she will not let you leave
your eyes
i do not need them anymore where we are going we will not need eyes to see
if you miss me you will blow out the hull you will die too
weir is dead
then who the fuck are you
what are you
you know
you want me to believe you are the devil well i do not that is bullshit
i am not the devil
then what what are you tell me
there is no devil there is no god there is only nothing
you are lying
i am not asking you to believe me you will see for yourself and so will your crew you are all coming with me
i do not like it either but you know the rules we get the call we go is the course locked in
heading three three four
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
we have a lock on the event horizon s navigation beacon it is in the upper ionosphere we are in for some chop
we are all on edge smith we are a long way out
that is not it that ship was built to go faster than light that is just wrong it goes against everything we know
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings
i guess we are about to find out keep us slow and steady
yes sir
we have got some weather
1500 meters we are getting too close
put it through tacs smith you up for a flyby
it is now we are locked in
captain miller
smith where the hell have you been
do we have enough time for a weld
no one s dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks
captain miller you copy
you break all the laws of physics you think there will not be a price you already killed the first crew
thank you
captain we got a problem
now what
she was right behind me i turn around she is gone she could be anywhere
what is it smith
smith get out of there
come again skipper
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock
no no we just got her back together
where is it where is it
ion drive will engage i not minus ten minutes
starck why are not you on the bridge
i just finished drying
crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
something s wrong with the bio scan
that is an affirmative
everybody okay
we are all here
it tastes bad
the antennae array s completely fried we have got no radio no laser no highgain no one s going to be coming to help us
how much oh two do we have
oxygen is not the problem
carbon dioxide
it is building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot
that is causing the readings
that is the point i will just get the same thing
not acceptable i want to know that is causing those readings if the crew is dead i want the bodies i want the crew found
i can reconfigure the scan for c 12 amylase proteins
maybe one of the original crew
what is it starck
i ran the bio scan with the dna rna filter the results were bio readings of indeterminate origin
bio readings of indeterminate origin do not you have anything useful to tell me
you have got to listen
to what what are you saying this ship is alive
i did not say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
it is not bullshit it is the only conclusion the data supports
starck do you know how crazy that sounds it is impossible
if you knew it was impossible then why would you waste my time
what i want is to survive the next ten hours
miller come in
that is going on in there starck
he is awake he is in the airlock he is not wearing a suit
i am on my way starck
tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can
weir cannot be alive
weir activated the drive he is sending us to the other place
blow the fucker up
blow it up
i will do it
we are armed this fucker s ready to blow
repeat we are armed
he is been past mars
he served on the goliath
here s another one they are all over the place
dr weir that is this the door to
yes we can see some kind of mist what is that
blood looks like arterial spray
can you see a body
no i saw nothing
about an hour ago in medical i saw my son he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were
is not it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
there s no one in the corridor but us
he is engaged the override
yes yes justin we heard it
keep him talking
almost got it
we have to do something oh god
you got any coffee
it is cold
where is she
jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker
what the hell is that
the safety circuit is failed
i did not see anything and i do not have to see anything this ship is fucked
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
30 hours to neptune orbit
you cannot do that
this is u s aerospace command vessel lewis and clark hailing event horizon event horizon do you read this is the lewis and clark hailing
if they are they are screening their calls
the scope is lit it is right in front of us
range 500 meters and holding turbulence is dropping off
what happened to his eyes
explosive decompression
miller do you read me peters
get them back
what if the air has gone bad we cannot wear these suits forever
a straight line
the reactor s still hot we have got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious
could it be the crew if they were in suspended animation would not that effect the scan
what is it
what is it
it must be hard being so far away from her
yes i miss her she died two years now
maybe a power interruption crashed the system
what are you doing
in our current environment dr weir self control is an asset
what is it
the forward airlock
justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean
well good that is very nice
by grabthar s hammer dr lazarus i
do not do that i am not kidding
i am sorry sir i was only
just do not
this is it
yes sir marvelous is not it completely distractionless
good luck on your mission sir by grabthar s hammer by the suns of warvan i wish you
uh uh what did we talk about
sir it is you thank ipthar
quellek what are you doing in there
i avoided capture using the mak tar stealth haze where is everyone
not so bad we will get you to medical quarters you are going to be fine
i i do not think i am going to make it sir
do not speak quellek
come on old friend
you will go out there
i will not and nothing you say
the show must go on
i am glad you asked to me the most important qualities of a galaxy explorer are loyalty
god what an ass
at ease men
we have got to stop
we stop we die keep holding the thruster down tommy
you do not hold a thruster down it is for quick boosts
no we are almost through
do not be insane stop full stop
about this much
that is the scale is that ten miles a hundred miles
there it is the beryllium sphere
go ahead
fred s no good jason you are going to have to kill it
alexander please you are my advisor advise me
well you have to figure out what it wants that is its motivation
hundreds dead all so you could play at being the commander you have murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch
purple skinned monstrosity
i was staying in character egomaniacal sonofabitch
sense memory i see you got to win the fight
hex alex are you okav
yes good was done this
he is a twit
not again
settle down alex
what the hell is going on
he wants to think
could you possibly try not to hit every single one
that is happened
you were holding it upside down were not you
shut up
you know with the makeup and everything1 i actually thought he was smart for a second
you think you could do better laredo
and note the sucked in gut
he is a miserable twit
oh alex get away from that thing
alex you cannot just leave
oh good there s nothing to eat
why did not you stop at the market
i still have not got this bloody thing off
you could order something in
a boy comes to the door
oh my god it is real
we heard it the first time
may i get the check
we have have to stop
go into the cloud
alex where are you going
look at that will you look at that they look like little children
i do not know
those blue things ate everybody here
he knocked me out the sonofabitch where is he
back there you said the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals
no i did not
he always has to make the big entrance
he dissed us again brandon
oh okay
you have got the utility systems walkthrough right
i have sectors 1 28 i think hector has the upper levels
it is a television show okay that is all it is just a bunch of fake sets and wooden props do you understand
yes but we were wondering
we accidently traded vox units when we bumped into each other on saturday
oh oh i see oh
brandon i remember you from the convention right you had a lot of little technical observations about the ship and i spoke sharply to you
yes i know and i want you to know i thought about what you said i know you meant it constructively but
it is real brandon all of it it is real
i knew it i knew it
okay we got it
okay now left at the next turn past the oxygen units make a right there then go through the antimatter vent
okay okay now what
we would never have the budget for this
brandon just in case i die there s something i have to know
yes commander
what does the omega 13 do
well that is the big question is not it
how did you come to that conclusion
brandon 	time to go
okay now but
no wait are you
lt madison go
shit go
what up
i am at the control oaneh what do i do
raise the glass and push the blue button
that is it
structural damage at 68 percent
that is the weather like outside
there is no weather in space
the ship is sustaining structural damage
the enemy is matching velocity
computer what about our engines why do not we have power
the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress
negative the beryllium sphere will have to be replaced
negative no reserve beryllium sphere exists onboard
systems register functional
systems register functional
u what do you think
that possibly the valence bonds have shifted bi laterally
what does that mean
what does that mean yes i see yes it means that perhaps the bonding molecules have become covalent
covalent right so
a hologram
never mind fred
no i will kill you
as good as hopkins
how do you remember this stuff
you okay alex
the digital conveyor
we have got to get that valve turned off their oxygen is almost gone
listen i will go in create a distraction have this may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape
listen i was wondering would you guys mind if i sit in today see if anybody s interested in an autograph never know
crewman 6 call me guy
that is why you built this ship
the omega 13 why does that sound so familiar
where are the miners
i am so sick of being right
how the hell is fred supposed to project a hologram
they are still behind us
guy you are not going to get killed on the planet okay
oh i am not i am not then that is my last name
your last name
yeah what is it
we are screwed we are so screwed
that is it that is that is going to kill me
it does not have to be a hologram just a diversion
jason are we doing episode 31 or not
it is a rough plan guy what does it matter if we are doing episode 31 or not
i know you contruct a weapon look around can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe
we are oetting hammered jason return fire
hi everybody
more to the left stay parallel
assault on voltareck iii episode 31 i think
we are doing episode 31
they are gone
you have no idea what a perimeter is do you
not a clue you
we are alive
e are alive
a few fans built a little set in their garage i come in for an hour at most it is a nothing
how much of a nothing not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing
this is not mine wait where is that kid
it is jason
one minute i am hey i am dressing
let me try computer computer
only answers to me
but i am the commander
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says so that is what they built
wait when are you going to tell them
tell them about
who we are do not you think they are going to be pissed
are you kidding i am not going to tell them
well you have to tell them what if something happens we are actors not astronauts we cannot do this stuff
it is not the stuff i mean anybody can learn the stuff the important thing is commitmnt 99 of anything is just committing to it
hey hey where are you going
we have no right to do this they deserve to know
we are leaving jason we are leaving now
there s nobody here jason
i made the cut the line gesture you nodded okay
i thought it was the we are dead gesture i was agreeing like i know where the hold button is
maybe we can lose them in that cloud
are they behind us
can it be repaired
do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard
self control that is funny coming from the guy that slept with every moon princess and terrakian slave girl on the show
did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me
you are playing your good side
how does the rolling help actually
clenched jaw
jason can you hear me
thank god are you okay
yeah but i have got gorignak staring me in the face i think i can take it though
what what did he say
wait the pig lizard is gone why are they still chanting for the pig lizard
jason i do not think the pig lizard was gorignak
there s no hatch there s no hatch
we should not have to do this it makes no logical sense why is it here
because it was on the show
he is accelerating to mark 6
never doubted you for a second
where the hell is he an hour and a half late an hour and a half
you are kidding when for
you gotta admit they do love him
that is it it is go time
you should have let me hit him
you know that is really getting annoying
i have one job on this lousy ship it is stupid but i am going to do it got it
oh my god tommy stop the pod stop the pod
we got the sphere but the commander s down there with a bunch of cannibals teb reset the pod we are going back
that thing s not going to get us down there fast enough face it he is dead
i heard it too
jason you think you could get any closer to those mines
closer i can try
tommy look those lights
yes hi sarris how are you doing
deliver the device now or i will destroy your ship
listen i would like to but frankly i am not even sure where it is or even
you have ten seconds
then tell me one thing what does it do the device the omega 13
is it a bomb a booby trap tell me
stop please i do not know
prepare a tear harness for the female
no i swear i do not know please
wait what did you say
my name is jason nesmith i am an actor we are all actors
our dimwitted friends do not understand the concept of acting they have no theater no imagination these scientists
we we lie
accelerate to mark 4 tommy
i certainly but
commander welcome to the protector ii would you like to don your uniform
mind if we skip that i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys
you you mean earth
but commander the negotiation you you you fired on him
long live theramini take a left here
but what if sarris survives
oh i do not think so i gave him both barrels
how can we thank you commander you you have saved our people
weapons storage
it is perfectly safe i promise
to our brave guests few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes we are blessed to count ourselves among them
mathesar has sarris seen the historical records
no thank god he has not
then how did he find out about the device
our former commander was not strong
former commander
mathesar what is that
a thousand apologies we have failed you
you what what are you talking about
deception lies
i am not a commander there is no national space exploration administration there is no snip
but there it is
a model only as big as this
but why
you said we do appearances together or not at all
to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies and plenty of them
that is right just keep shaking it out here have some gum it helps
wh where are we
that is going on
excuse me
well it is this was a device we discovered on an alien planet we do not know what it does either
faster tommy get us out of here
could be this
do your best tommy
all right gwen alex fred follow me guy set up the perimeter tommy you keep a lookout make a signal if they come back
okay i will do this caw caw
oh right sorry
sorry guys it just went off
okay on what
how about the pig lizard
go for the eyes like in episode 22 with
it does not have eyes
the throat the mouth its vulnerable spots
no no no
jason what about me what do i do
pedal to the metal tommy
let s do it tommy
commander call me laredo
hold course laredo
continue forward sir
find them
but sir my men the core implosion is not reversible
enerao i have host them the maanetlsm o the field is disrupting our onstru ait there they are
what wh
because they are coming right at us
where are we now commodus can you see the camp my gods the air is turning into ice
we are nearly there lucilla
that is what you told me two days ago
will you please get back in your wagon and stay there
more wine sister surely you can drink more than that
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed
quite so narcissus and his courageous men may they live long to serve rome
do not you think you should at least wave
they hate me they really hate me do not they
i should at least have you do not you think
did narcissus die today was not this his day to die
those are priceless sculptures
it is disgusting animals i had to come here under armed guard slaves get this junk out of my sight
how about in the forum right in front of the senate
if i may be so bold
for the gods spit it out
kill him tribuus execute that bastard
tribuus tomorrow
where have you been
taking my pleasure do i need to clear my lovers with you
you must start clearing everything with me especially your lovers
why are you so surly you have won brother the people have bread and the city is quiet
what is that wailing
what are you talking about
now that we are done with that infatuation forever
if i ever loved narcissus it was not like you want
encased in the armor of a demigod narcissus the good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast
tell lykas to send a retiarius and a samnite to help tiger
you cannot do that listen to the mood of the crowd
i want that bastard dead
you want control of the crowd you cannot get it by killing their hero
i am their hero
not yet dear brother
lykas pick a man someone who will look good jerses i want it built up in the daily action
damn him i should have killed him on the front i let you talk me out of that
respectfully caesar quintus and i must report
do you expect marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience
that is difficult to say general
then you would be out of a job
gladly caesar
i back rome against all her enemies if that answer disappoints you i am not a politician
i would say there s nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what right is
you and my father have become very close perhaps one day i may say the same for us
you flatter me caesar
i am ordering a general stand down in preparation for withdrawal back across the danube
they will not break this one
where is my family
cooperate and they will be returned to your estate i could have executed you
caesar ignore them
ignore that the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better
gods of hell this must cost a fortune how many days is this going to go on
and like children everywhere they scream freedom the most when they desire it least i beg you please continue caesar
throw it down into the streets down into the forum if it is my father they want then give him to them
yes you know that is not a bad idea
maybe it will crush gaius
i am serious
so am i
we can crush gaius another way what if you do throw something to the people they really want make them a gift of food
take grain away from the army
caesar let me sponsor your first wager in the arena
marcus aurelius has died
we must obey our emperor and the senate
this is the only place in rome where i thought i believed i was wholly in power
where is my father
tribuus what happened in the arena was narcissus killed
why is not he dead damn you you promised me he would be dead
yes caesar
tribuus go left here i want to see my new statue at via claudia
yes caesar
you won an impossible fight you got the attention of the crowd legate
cos what in hades is the emperor up to and do not tell me you do not know
i do not know
agh please he is having a secret device constructed for the circus the brass craftsmen are working overtime
so tell me what happened between you and the emperor what really happened on the german front you know the senate s arguing your case
that is their job is not it to argue so i think my case will be long on talk and short on action
my birth sign is water bearer twenty fifth day in the month of janus
the battle was won today and i prefer to believe it was a gift of janus the eldest god of rome god of my ancestors
god of passages and changes
i have read of it
the trouble is defining exactly what right is
who are you narcissus the good i have heard of narcissus meridas that is who i hear you are
you are hearing about somebody else
how did you get condemned to the arena without a trial
when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial you would have to give me your word
i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing
you are a citizen and a soldier not a gladiator
you on your way to trial too general or do you think they have already had our trial
why you
my loyalties were in doubt
fools to let us both live we will be our own best witnesses at our trial
is this rome are we just going to be executed
no future telling please i have been terrified enough for one day
you know our two most senior senators gaius cantus and falco verus
i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities
sneaking around with your brother
without him he would be weeping if he overheard that well the idea of you as my adopted brother is very exciting
i am not fit for the job and as a matter of fact i am not taking the job
why do you keep playing at being so humble it is a little embarrassing
it is my brother s neck you want not mine
i came here to see that you stay alive the people need a living breathing alternative to commodus a hero
you mean a symbol of someone who does not exist
to think i brought my daughters up on all things roman read to sleep on catullus lucretius virgil every night my beautiful daughters
you cannot die
would that marcus had lived
marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son
he killed his father and then my family
commodus it is we who are going on the offensive
i want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign
servis made it through again
marcus you honor me but i am a soldier politics scare the hell out of me
the senators admire you
i made the plume from a quail feather
as soon as i can
on your honor as a roman officer daddy
i see the emperor s little boy has finally caught up with the army
what the hell was all that about
what the hell do you think it was about there s nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others
why do not we try to keep politics out of the conversation
everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal
what deal
rome is going to pay tribute like a defeated nation begging for mercy have you told your troops that
my troops do not make policy
you brought the army into rome
i was summoned
it is your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons
it is my job to keep my job and that by the way is now head of praetorian guard good ole tribuus has been retired
he is very realistic
what about their philosophy lessons
they are studying with cynics
you need to come home
i can see that
this is our oil from our estates
i am a soldier we are at war i cannot stay home tending the damned olive groves
let him trust quintus
quintus is overly idealistic
i never knew a more idealistic man than you
me well i believe in rome you would have to after what i have seen how people outside the empire treat each other
i do not even want to imagine the things you have seen
i will never die you tell the girls that you honor our ancestors and i will be there every night at the table of life
you teach them
you are a legate in the roman army huh and you act like one what was your crime
condemned are not i owed a trial before being condemned
general all i know is you have been condemned to the colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen
take your hands off me animal
i refuse to be your slave i refuse
legate narcissus meridas general of the spanish felix legions i am proud to have you in my school now show them what you can do
i am not a gladiator i refuse to fight
general do you realize what happened out there today
i did not get killed and everyone else did
what would the poster say narcissus would kill for a taste of golden pompeii olive oil
proximo if this is her doctor he is an assassin
it will be good luck for you to wear that helmet it belonged to cimon of smyrna he was crushed by an elephant
tiger s challenged you and jerses has made me an offer made us both an offer you take a fall
so i pretend i am dead you get gold what do i get
you get to come alive again in the country
as what the galloping gladiator
tell me honestly since this may be our last earthly meeting if this were a fair fight where would you put your money
on you of course you are my bravest fighter the best fighter i have ever seen
how much money is involved
a great deal they designed and build tiger s chariot
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right they do not waste time
i can really rape them on this can i at least tell them you will think about it
no tell them i will do it but i want more posters all over rome
fantastic wonderful but posters are very expensive
then get a large cash advance
right right but they will have to bring in a lawyer i do not want to get sued over this
before they leave get gold
right right what am i thinking of
i want another interview with cos tell him to bring plenty of ink
so things change the government has moved to the circus you are going to fight last and commodus is going to fight first
you were a soldier and then a gladiator were not you
i want nothing to do with the arena
no thanks i am not thirsty
why am i here
they said on the phone you were assigned to the meyers case
well when you put it that way
right so why do not we get on with this investigation
one set of muddy shoe prints
where judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell
unable to escape she turns and attacks the killer but does not connect
the killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought iron poker
as which point she drops to her knees in pain

it is a real privilege sandman
thanks i thought you would be older i expected a red
i am
your own work
i designed it myself what will it be a face job or a full body job
just the face
do you have anything special in mind
i do not care just get it over with
you are here i could not believe it when they told me what are you doing
open your eyes once idiot it is not every day that a sandman son is born i am telling you francis that is him
had enough
you need a lift let s go to arcade and celebrate your alert successor logan 6
has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are
just wondered what happens
but you do not know you just say what everyone says one for one one for one
did you ever see francis 8
i do not know what makes you so curious you have any idea who his seed mother was
you missed something special
you should have been with us in nursery daniel i am positive i recognized him
now there s a few who could have been his seed mother
who invited you
that was a great shot you made
i just might look in on new you 483 myself
you why you are already beautiful
what the hell took you so long
did you ever see anybody renew
i think you have been skulling out too much first nursery and now stupid questions
did you
of course
anybody we know
look why do not you get into the water you need it more than i do
i am fine see you
that is going on logan
it has nothing to do with you
why did you do that
i did not do anything francis they have made us believe that
it is him the first sandman he killed doc
that is right the other one came after the older one smashing killing burning
and he was hunting the first one this one was not he was not he this one was running the other one was hunting him
that is your name
i am mary 2
why are not you in nursery
i am very smart
when do you go up
that is wrong available
no just no
well then
nothing i felt sad i put myself on the circuit it was a mistake
sad what made you sad
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight now he is gone
yes probably he was renewed
he was killed
killed why do you use that word
is not it right is not that what you do kill
i never killed anybody in my life sandmen terminate runners who brought you
nobody i felt sad i put myself on the circuit
but you put yourself on the circuit
i changed my mind
about what
let s have sex i thought you were curious
not about that
i am listening
i am afraid to tell you
i am not armed well
why is it wrong to run
you should not even think such things and you picked a strange person to say them to
i suppose but what if you want to live
but if you are one of the misfits that is where i come in
i did not say that i would run i just
are you a 5 or a 6
six i go red next year
you could have called me yourself
but i was not sure you would come
i could not get you out of my mind
i am the most beautiful woman you have ever seen i suppose
maybe sure
thanks but i have the choice
of course
you can have any woman in the city what do you really want
you know
i do not believe you there has to be more
why show me
i am going to run
why tell me
you know something
about running dying what
both running s what i am interested in
i know what everyone knows try like hell for renewal you have the same chance everyone else has
it is different now help me
where did you get that
a runner gave it to me
and then you killed him right
i let him go believe me
i do not
speak to your friends for me jessica please
please what friends
i do not have much time
i never heard of a sandman running ever
are you here to help me
what are you going to do
that is tomorrow
i wish i could help you
maybe you will think of something
if you did know you would tell me
of course
if you trusted me you would know
a runner cathedral a woman
you are not going are you
i would rather be with you
they are like beasts wild
maybe they are angry because they are grown in meccano breeders
instead of what nine months inside a woman we are all raised the same but most of us do not become cubs in cathedral
some people say children need human mothering
insane nurseries are better than any mother could be
i am only telling you what i have heard have not you ever wondered what your seed mother was like
uh uh
i have
when did you begin to question lastday
i do not remember exactly except i was a green what would you like to relive logan
just follow no matter how it seems
i am ashamed i was bringing you to be killed
where sanctuary can you take me there
logan i do not know where sanctuary is but if i take you to them they will kill you
all right but why i did not kill the runner
yes but they will not know that or care they are hunting you logan maybe me too now
that is nothing there s a sandman behind us too and there will be more soon take me to them
i i cannot
then why do not you leave me go to them explain
are you taking me to them
yes i do not know what else to do with him following us why do you keep running from your
because he is my friend and i do not want to be killed by him or anyone
he is good is not he
will he find us and kill us yes or one of the others you know there s only one place to go now
they will not believe us
i would rather take my chances with them than with francis
they will not listen
you think sandmen will there s no other way for me
exactly four steps now let me lead you now to the right it is narrow here you will have to get behind me
how will they know we are coming
will you take me with you
how do we know this is the right way
what do you suppose this was
some kind of breeding pens i suppose they say people used to breed animals fish anything to eat of course
i am afraid
i do not know that is going to happen to us logan but are you glad you did not kill him
it does not make any difference anymore
you are really one of us now are not you
you knew that i was not before did not you why did you stay with me
i wanted to and you what made you kill sandmen
i had to i did kill for the first time in my life i killed
that is that
it feels like breath it makes everything move your hair is moving
i hate outside i hate it
do not
it is getting dark and cold i am tired
do you think everything s going to turn to ice
i doubt it
do not ever let go
it all seemed to make sense until box
maybe we are the first ones to get through maybe sanctuary is near now another protected place it could not be outside
you are right it must be near now we will find it
what does it mean
you can have any woman in the city what do you really want
you know jessica
but i still have the choice
of course
i have never seen a face like that before it must be the look of great age whoever he was he was terribly old
they all have names and numbers on them i wonder what they are
look at his face and his hair is that what it is to grow old
that sweet madman how could he come to exist
he had a mother and father and he knew them
there s a sanctuary there is
you want there to be one that does not
what are we promising him what can we possibly give him
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes
we cannot we are going back
to what
i am going to try and tell people what we have seen and
you are lying you will never have the chance to tell anybody anything you will be killed the moment you are seen
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them
things will not change you know that we can live here together logan have a life as long as his together
things change
yes you and i jessica
and sanctuary
beloved husband
what does that water do
it is part of the hydrogalvanic system the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow
is it inside the city
yes cats of course what else could they be cats of course each one has his own name too
are you sure
what kind of jewel is this
i do not know
what belongs to the people
all this all of it
what people
we will have to bury him
that is that
i will make the arrangements
of course that is settled then but just you remember your promise
come with us
we do not get many sandmen i think we have only had one other since i have been here
a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else where is the doctor
i like your face would you mind if doc took a picture i would like him to give your face to somebody else

i think i can handle that one
you think you can learn mccall

i cannot do that
nah i just throw that in because i enjoy it
so what do i say to this guy
you could say something like tell me what the scumbag s name is maybe we can work something out
if you want to be a successful negotiator you have got to learn to lie
i am not good at lying
get good at it
that is the first commandment
you tell me
to save lives

you know why i like the track
i have two words for you seek help

you are crazy
it might have happened no matter who was up there
bullshit would it have happened to you
how many have you lost
i look at it as how many i have saved that is the way you have got to look at it
and what about the ones you do not save
you live with it and they haunt you it does not leave
and what if you cannot live with it
he is gonna kill her no matter what if i take him these jewels he is gonna kill me and her

forget her
she still loves me
she thinks you are a bucket of dog vomit trust me on this
she is my destiny
destiny you living in a perfume commercial she is a hard climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride
i have crawled through the gutter through every wrinkle in the human brain
what i am saying but you still come out this goofball romantic
that is that present from faith
what is it
my god lenny what is it
black jack
blackjack i do not understand
snuff clip it was iris she said she needed my help and i aw jesus mace the sick fucker killed her
and gives it to you
jesus mace back off

you ever wonder why you get beat up a lot
he knows what he is doing he is worn before a lot
so that gives you something
do not crank the gain any more you are gonna fry yourself
no more lenny
she came to me for help i should have read it better i just figured y know another strung out hooker having a bad night
but that does not add does it
no it does not
she said if they get me they which means the whole sex killer thing is a cover which means somebody whacked her for a reason
so the guy s not a sicko
because it had to look random not connected to anything or anyone but then why give the rape to me
that is where it gets a little strange
and what about the guy that was following me
how is zander
i am sorry about getting on your case earlier i just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper and i anyway i am sorry
whatup lenny
where we going
what is it
will you relax there s nobody back there
mace the guy had a knife to my throat in my living room relaxing might be right out okay
you better keep a low profile for a while
think back about what she said exactly what she said
she wanted to go out to my car something about my car
lenny give them the tape
take it easy the glass is bullet resistant
bullet resistant whatever happened to bullet proof
goddamnit 911 is busy

so let s see i have got tran s goons some squidhead psycho and the lapd all trying to kill me happy new year lenny
well look at the plus side
there s a plus side
yeah you gave up your hot tub tape to save me that is real progress for you
it was a tough call
i still cannot square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops
he is totally cut off from the outer world
the only card we have to play is the tape you know we get it to the media somehow
kinda guy you can count on in a pinch
okay we gotta get over there can you borrow a dress from cecile or something
i am not going
yeah lenny i have
it did not stop you from loving them right or understanding them or being able to forgive them
i guess
and it did not stop you from wanting to protect them did it
mace you are a girl
got your ticket

and do what take on his whole posse
that is the original there are no copies
take it to him
a cop you want me to trust a cop

it must have been hard leaving your work
now how did you get hurt
i had an accident
what do you do on the towers
on the towers
ah no
do not tell me you are a mud carrier
thousands and thousands of people and sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories
and everyone looks like us
she did not want me to be a climber she wanted me to be a planner like her
how can they just go back to work as if nothing happened
what else can they do
kalen do you have any idea where they take them
the hall of books
you have books kalen you have got to take me there there might be history records something to help us find where the morlocks took
no one ever comes here my mother told me stories about it late at night they tell all the children
what kind of stories
i had a friend who came here once sort of a dare
what happened
please just listen to me your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt i will find her
but you are only a mud carrier
well you wanted to see it
this is it
yes just about here
right up your alley i would think you are from the past yes
i must say you look remarkably good you do not want a book then
what are you
i am the librarian i have always been the librarian
sir have you a name
you know of them
who does not know the morlocks
but you escaped
i was lucky the others were not
regenerating fission reactor you would not understand it is power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity
because you will never die
excuse me
and if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time
when was his mother taken
last night
send him home you do not want him to see it
my god i saw this
are not you a plucky little
it is what they want you to see
this is the way in
yes are you sure you want to do this
in for a penny in for a pound do you know that saying
that is it all for
the air the power
why did they built it
alexander listen to me it was wrong to bring you you are not going to find what you are looking for
what do you mean
takes a licking but keeps on ticking for a while anyway
i will not leave you like this
go back to the light you were not made for this i was i was made for this moment
i do not understand
now get out of my sight you hideous primate
i will never forget this
i should hope not alexander make them read my books tell them who they are who they could be
well alexander as a fellow scientist i know you have a thousand questions
you came underground when the world was ending above and you evolved some into the morlocks and others
you would not understand we genetically engineered the morlock class to serve our needs
how do you control the morlocks
and what of the eloi
they survived above became what they are
but this is barbaric have you completely lost all sense of
and who are you alexander who are you to question thousands of years of evolution this is the world now i am fact
go back to where you came from or die here
why would you let me go back
we have lost the capacity to reproduce but the species must continue
she will not remember you none of them will you will be forgotten that is how history works
a man can change his history
that was a foolish thing to do
i could have a hundred morlocks here in thirty seconds
i know
i am tired of running
i do not think that is going to happen
it is spectacular
thanks old nell s my girl all right al least when she decides to move stubborn beast
i have only read about them and the new internals
now that is what i call plain crazy internal combustion is just too dangerous all those little explosions never catch on
how do you keep the water temperature stable
god could have killed me bad girl nell how did you know to do that
ahhh i am afraid i have got a prior commitment
next time then we perambulate here most every night
may i help you

they are rare orion s belt pointing to the earth
the sailor s omen of good fortune the hunter watching over him on his travels
heavens look at that now
now i know you are ill passing up the chance to explore some new gadget
alex people are staring

the point is i know it will work once the um numbers and such are in order
do you know you were humming
i was not
somewhere around would 2xy something something
damned if i can keep her out of my equations
tonight s the night
you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers
where is the challenge in that
alex this is your first year as an associate professor you might want to play things a little more conservatively
look at them philby all alike everyone in an identical bowler hat do you want your students to turn out like them
i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge
i do not i want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see
you may not like it but this is the world we live in alex little grey men with little grey hats
emma actually likes chalk dust says it smells like me
she made the best shepherd s pie i ever tasted
do you have a romantic bone in your body
i am sorry david
it hurt me alex very much
you know that is what it is mrs watchit tells me you are here at all hours day and night
that is because i am working you remember that you used to care about your work
i live with it every minute of every day
alex nothing will ever change what happened but
what is it
you would not believe me
i would
i will tell you what come by for dinner in a week and i will show you
why do not you come to our house instead
i cannot do that
when s the last time you were outside this house or this room
that is absurd
you will not say that in a week
all right i will come for dinner and in the meantime you will think about what we discussed
good night david
and this would be my study there was an elm tree outside the window then
this was my home
could not help but overhearing two fine young people starting out on the road of life i wish you the very best
and your jewelry too i guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss
did you hear me lad
how long did you travel
is there a lot of illness
your husband is dead
you are not from beyond the valley
you might find the truth rather hard to understand
oh that explains everything
i know it is hard to believe but it is true
that machine
allowed me to travel from my time to yours
how long ago
why not
i might find the truth rather hard to understand can you go back
yes or forward into the future i suppose i really should check on the machine see that it has not been damaged
is he all right
i am going to sit with kalen keep the fire burning if you can
i will take you to your machine tomorrow
you seem fascinated by the stars
you can see so many here
do not then have stars where you come from
good night then
mara i had a strange dream last night i was here walking through a forest very much like this and then
we all have that dream
all of you
every night
you share dreams that is incredible
this is magnificent
thank you
the mud carriers
i can see kalen s point
it is not supposed to be easy it is supposed to be beautiful
that is it all for
i do not understand
i mean why do you do it what purpose does it serve
it has no purpose it is just beautiful does everything have a purpose where you come from
what are you
i am a planner i help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like
it was a great city the greatest city in the world
learning was important
oh very learning commerce the arts the whole place was buzzing all the time night and day
it must have been safe
oh it was most of the time
it sounds like a wonderful place to live
those rocks over there they are the same this is central park
you know this
this is where my journey started right here
someone you loved very much
yes after her death it was intolerable for me here the future had to be better
is it
good it looks fine we had quite a ride together
it is undamaged
yes a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship shape
so you can use it now
yes i suppose so
go back to your own time
mara what
oh huzzah the master s home
do you have it
now that is more like it you look a proper gentlemen for once
then if emma turns me down will you marry me
oh i am already swooning
yes sir he
all right mrs watchit you can go
may i get you some
i see
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is applied mathematics and engineering am i correct
imagine that
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum
well perhaps i have deviated the tiniest bit
might i ask why
with respect sir would we have the telegraph without fantasy would we have radium and x rays without someone first dreaming we could
the advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation a careful evolutionary process not chalkboard parlor tricks
my equations are not parlor tricks
abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical durations even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point
yes sir
and hungry i would say you had such a long journey
i did
what are your people called
well i guess you would call us new yorkers
he said he traveled for two months
to live in there s a lot of us beyond the valley
i am the oldest
no i mean someone considerably older your father perhaps
my father has gone to a better place
i am sorry i did not mean to

a solitary vireo i like that one
their sound is quite musical
how does it sound
i cannot
i would love to hear it
something like that
that was terrific
you should hear the bird
you live around here
not too far are you a bird watcher too
me nah i am more of a people watcher
were you watching me
not at first you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently any second i thought you would take off and fly
i have to go
do you come here often
my daddy likes me home before dark
see anything interesting
what are you writing in that book
do not you have friends
i have friends
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends
i am not pretty
what does that mean
that is up
you do not know
i have no idea
i think you do
i have not broken any laws
then you will not mind if i look around
i would

you said last night i went to bed pretty early
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty
i was not feeling well
i could take you downtown
that is a nasty scratch on your neck
i have a passionate girlfriend
that is with the boxes
you are a cop figure it out
i would say you are moving
then i would say you are a lucky fellow
i count my blessings
you sure you do not know nothing about this
so how are you adjusting
i am adjusting okay
and your new apartment
apartment s okay
are you taking your medication
it gives me headaches
sergeant lucas may i come in
the new man i would keep away from him if i were you
why s that
you do not want to know but he is damaged goods real damaged goods if you know what i mean
just trying to be helpful
have you seen walter
people have the right to know
yeah like the bird
can i ask how old you are
i am twelve
no you are not
how come
a long time ago i was sent far away when they let me come back all my friends were gone
it sounds like you were banished
would you like to sit on my lap
no thank you
are you sure
i am sure thank you all the same
that is okay does not matter
they sound like finches
my daddy lets me sit on his lap
that is her name
ms kramer

i cannot
you said you could not make the sound of a solitary vireo but you did beautifully i heard you
what will happen if i do
but will he
your daddy will always love you
how do you know
i know because it is just something i know
i do not want to hurt my daddy
i do not mind
you should go home
cannot i stay a little longer
it is getting dark go home
and how is your job
the job s okay
do i take okay to mean you feel good about working there
i said the job is okay
that is right you did have you made any friends there
i am not running for mr popularity
you seem a little hostile today
it is called sarcasm dr rosen
no need to call me doctor i am a therapist not a psychiatrist
i would like you to keep a journal
a diary
that is right
no way
why not
diaries have sent too many guys to prison
i do not understand
ev i dence
oh it never crossed my mind
of course
it was just an idea
bad idea
that is right
you think reflection is good
it is very good indeed
try it
no fucking way
how is the journal
i am still thinking about it
you do not like coming here do you
it is okay
but you do not like coming here be honest walter
honest no
good that is an honest answer and why do not you like coming here
honest your cheery personality makes my skin itch
is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch
forget it
maybe it is the way i look or the sound of my name
rosen i do not have a problem with that
because if you did i know a therapist named ryan i also know a therapist named chung
how do you feel about that
i do not feel anything
you have no feelings for your niece
she was born after they put me away how can i have feelings
then why are you talking about this
have to talk about something
have you talked to carlos about your concerns
i am not that crazy
do you think you are crazy
if i am not then what the hell am i doing here
why do you think you are here
you know why it is part of the parole deal
is that what you are angry about
talking to you is like riding on a merry go round
how long is this going to take
we have a few more minutes
i mean when will i be normal
we have a lot of work to do
will i ever be normal
i could not say
you could not say
i am afraid not
do you know what normal is
i suppose it is however society defines it
how do you define it
i do not
then how do you know if your patients are getting better
they usually tell me
how do they know
what is your idea of being normal
what is your idea of being a jew
whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you why do not we continue this on thursday
i want to be normal
then go see a therapist who will tell you you are normal
fuck you rosen
i know
you do not know
i do not know
what did you think would happen
i do not know
what did you want to happen
you know that if anything happens i spend the rest of my life in prison no parole no nothing
is this the first one
of course it is that is why i am telling you
walter we will pick up here next time
i want to talk about it now
we will talk about it more on thursday
remember when you asked me what my idea of normal was
please do not do it again
i said i was sorry
when did it all start
you mean my problem
if by problem you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes
i do not know
that is not a helpful answer

what took you so long
going somewhere
do not try to talk
listen you have to finish me off you do not want me coming back
whistler i
beautiful day is not it
how can you be out here
it is not very effective in direct sunlight but it is a start the goal of course is to be like you the day walker
you are not going anywhere
who dies first
guess you are not quite as invulnerable as you thought
you are wrong a few minutes more and my transition will be complete even your sword will not be able to affect me then
you are too human blade
is something wrong my friend
you are blind
hold out your hands
i did not come here to get my palms read i need something translated
this is an old tongue from an old world it concerns lamagra
who is lamagra
the blood tide
yes the vampire apocalypse it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst
i am tired dawn is coming
but i just got here
you should not be here
he is a vampire
because you are tainted the venom s still inside you you could still turn on us
i cannot just leave i have a life here a career
i can go to the police i have blood samples back at the hospital i can show them
do it you will be dead before you can file the complaint
how did you know
figured they would send someone after you thought i would wait around and see who showed up
you used me as bait
it worked did not it
but he could have
but he is a policeman
why in god s name would anyone want to work for them
because they are vampire wanna bes if they are loyal if they prove themselves then their masters will turn them
and that is a good thing
what are you doing
you cannot do this he is human it is murder
there is no cure
what are you looking at
you let him go an hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less this one did not even talk
looks like we hit pay dirt this place is crawling with them see the valets over there they are vampires so is the doorman
how can you tell
so many of them i still cannot believe they are real
there are worse things than vampires out there
like what
what is this place
some kind of archive
is not this all a little high tech i thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins
you are hurt
what am i injecting you with
it is dark in here
i cannot close my eyes without hearing her scream
i made a trip to the hospital last night borrowed some equipment
you care about him do not you
my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart
any progress
some it is been slow
you do not look so good
for what it is worth i am sorry
are you all right
i have been better
how long have we been driving
is it bad
it will not work on you
get out of here
i am not leaving without you
tearing me apart
i cannot i will not be able to stop
i never imagined i would be so happy to see the sun rise it is over is not it
how is it going kam
you are a week early
whistler says i am building up a resistance to it
i was afraid that might happen
maybe it is time to start exploring other alternatives
but you died
deacon brought me back
how could you be a part of this
these are my people now i am one of them
you do not have to be
i wish you could see the world as i do deacon opened my eyes there s no turning back from that
i do not believe that
this is not human blood
then what is it
i thought you promised to give me some distance
five minutes not a second more and i do not want to hear a word about us
you have not started in on the internal organs
but then i remember what an ass hole you were and i am snapped back to reality
blade once again our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade he must be destroyed
i see and what would you have us do with this half breed
study him unlock the secrets of his dna he is the key we have been looking for
how do you like that right on time
i was wrong about you blade you were never one of us you are a traitor to your race
who are you people
consider it a parting gift vampire mace silver nitrate essence of garlic
we keep in radio contact
why did not you tell me the truth about him
blade s unique you know a one in a billion anomaly he can withstand sunlight garlic even silver but he still has the thirst
no offense whistler but you are not exactly working with state of the art equipment here you might have missed something
why do you hunt them
i had a family once a wife three daughters then a drifter named deacon frost came calling one evening
he killed them
how did you escape
and now you are using blade to exact your revenge
i would not go in there if i were you it is best to leave him alone when he is like this
all right let s start with the basics why do vampires need to drink blood
their own blood cannot sustain hemoglobin
what happened to the power
excuse me but would you mind explaining why you are watching the lady upstairs
i hate this
now look what you did
what did i do
you threatened to drive her downtown she has agoraphobia
fear of what
it is good medicine
where were you do not tell me it is just under seventy right the sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh
i have told you i cannot afford to garage it
are you kidding you buy enough gourmet junk every week most of which rots to garage a fleet of stretch limos
i had the dream again and i got another call this time he spoke he said you and me you and me
a little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for forget it
oh god i am really crazy

most outlandish thing i ever heard tell do not seem right somehow

mary jabez
well i guess we will not be going to church today

you know ma why the squire came to see jabez

the new girl jabez says she is from over the mountain
mary ready first bell s a ringing
she will do nothing of the kind she is going to church with me right away
fox hunting a stone going fox hunting on a week day and the earth crying out for the touch of him
now ma you just try to set an example for me and keep hold of yourself
me why look here mary stone i am worried about you that is all
worried about me well you just stop it
that is that
so you have made up your mind to go to the party
you are not angry with me
be sure to let me know if daniel is over there
well martin i only wear them in washington that is the trouble but if you ever come down there i will show them to you
it is
you have got a smart man mrs stone hang onto him
i have heard some odd things about jabez lately he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself
mr webster you must not believe all that people say
mr webster you will help him
there is nothing like a good old country breakfast where is ma
someone to see you dan l
if it is the british minister take him around to the pantry and give him some madeira
just someone from new hampshire
it is only a short drive mr webster
oh it is you again what do you want
with the presidential election coming up i thought i could be of some help sir
i would rather see you on the side of the opposition
say that is pretty good young man
mr webster i presume
attorney of record for jabez stone might i ask your name
why certainly but be careful mr scratch medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back even with old timers like yourself
oh not that you ever get drunk no indeed but a kind of overpowering lassitude or more plainly a deep and enveloping sleep
there is not enough medford rum in the whole of new hampshire to make me sleepy
talk has never proved that question mr webster cup for cup what do you say
not so fast mr scratch produce your evidence if you have it
foreign and who calls me a foreigner
then i stand on the constitution i demand a trial for my client
very well you shall have your trial mr webster the case is hardly one for an ordinary jury
let it be the quick or the dead so it is an american judge and an american jury
the quick or the dead you have said it may the best man win mr webster
my congratulations as between two gentlemen
that is not it it is the loneliness mr scratch the loneliness
the loneliness lonely with all your gold mister stevens that hardly makes sense
i want someone to talk to
you can talk to me

i am sorry detective morelos
hey did you guys find my stuff
your stuff
oh yeah i did not see the accident
witnesses said you were there but i notice you did not file a report
a report
a police report
that is cause i was not there
you were not at harrison s department store the night before
i was in the store the accident was outside it was a bus
someone said you spoke to mr zavitz before he died i thought you might know something
about what
about the accident
i am no expert but i am assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused
mr zavitz was in trouble
what kind of trouble
you tell me
i cannot
are you invoking attorney client privilege
i am not his attorney
than why cannot you tell me
because i do not know
i am just trying to determine if mr zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident
than why do not you talk to the bus driver
why so edgy mr dean
somebody took my blender
anything at all
no sir
was he with anyone
not that i could see
why would you go to harrison s
to buy lingerie
for your wife
yes for my wife what the hell kinds of questions are these
i do not know that is going on with zavitz but that was way way outa line you understand
this guy s a fat assed rotarian gasbag
uh oh
not a very good one but
so you tap everyone s phone you use computers to probe financial records new search and seizure laws
just for the criminals
you should take this seriously
you are a lawyer do not you care that is going on around you
i saw a man die
what would you buy at harrison s
how would you get the information on depinto
what do you mean
who did you work with to get the
a guy named brill same guy as always
yeah but you said you have never met him how did you
honey i do not like to talk about this stuff in front of eric
i do not understand why jerry could not clear this up
well you know
he is got his priorities
how could you let me find out like this
it is not true
sources revealed an fbi investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars
i have seen it
at the center of the investigation are well known washington area attorneys robert dean and rachel banks

here s what you asked for brill s note said it was everything you would need to shall we say coax depinto
that was not the answer i was hoping for
soon or at least sooner than never
ten thousand cash i do not know if it is brill s prices going up or your commission
i take a straight 15 percent brill s fee varies with risk perhaps you would be more comfortable using someone else
other than brill
other than me
why would i
someone with whom you do not have quite so personal a
i like our history and i like you i would probably like brill if i ever got to
he does not work that way
i just want to make sure i am not breaking the law
you are not

i think i prefer to see my client privately
the room has a bug in it
everything is going to be okay frankie do not worry
did my brother go back
yeah but do not worry
he is ten times tougher than me my brother he is old fashioned
you are right
frankie you were always interested in politics in history i remember you talking about hitler back in 43 we were young then
yeah it worked those were great old days we was like the roman empire the corleone family was like the roman empire
do not worry about anything frankie five angels
and the tape will be running
what the hell are you talking about
we know you are a busy man with plenty of enemies we saw the opportunity to do you a favor and we did no strings
no one can trace anything to me i pride myself on that
do you gamble
a little that is so thought provoking about that
do you owe markers
there s thirty grand worth of paid off markers i never owed that much
our mistake but what does it matter it was our money we do not even expect thanks
you paid off thirty grand i never owed
we will keep it quiet the people who know are trustworthy the committee need not find out
and that is the price of their not finding out
simple be friendly like us not hostile
senator my client would like to read a statement for the record
mr hagen would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand
yes sir his name is vincenzo pentangeli
is he related to the witness
senator kane
this meeting is adjourned
this committee owes an apology
i am sorry mrs corleone we are not to let you through
i am going to the market
if you could just give us a list we will pick up anything you want
whose orders are these
anthony daddy s busy
how is the baby
sleeping inside me

yes michael it does
i am sorry about some of the people i had to see today it was bad timing but it could not be helped
leave her alone you are talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard
i had no idea
why do not you sit down
i am not going to stay long i cannot
there are a lot of things i want to talk to you about things i have been thinking about changes i want to make
i think it is too late for changes michael i promised myself i would not talk about it and i have gone and spoiled it
why too late
tell me michael what really happened with pentangeli
his brother came to help him
i did not even know he had a brother and where is he now
on a plane back to sicily
i will bring the children up now they want to say goodbye
kay i told you
goodbye michael
if that is what it takes then yes i will
at this moment i feel no love for you at all i never thought that could happen but it has
we will go back tonight bring the children
are you klingman
who s asking
where can we talk
who do you think you are talking to
you said you were klingman
you do not come in here talk to an owner in las vegas like that
you missed my point you are no longer an owner
it is michael how are you mom
i am alright will you stay home for awhile
there are still things i have to do
you talk about the baby she can have another baby
no i meant lose his family
your family how can you ever lose your family
sit down this is almost over you follow the baseball games
you are a considerate young man
you are a great man mr roth i have much to learn from you
however i can help you
the rosato brothers have performed services for you in the past i understand that they are under your protection
nothing is more important
pentangeli is a dead man do you object
it is always bad for business but you have no choice
then it is done i must choose his replacement it cannot be rosato
i still do not speak spanish michael
i would not consider anyone else
terrible i would give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting
who had frankie pantangeli killed
why the rosato brothers
this is it we think it makes vegas look like the corner crap game
very impressive
you know my lawyer tom hagen johnny ola
i just left our friend in miami
how is his health
not good
is there anything i can do anything i can send
they asked him to sign paper to take down the markers but he got mad told them to wait until he was finished
let him gamble
that is a complete falsehood
mr corleone do you have any hotel interests in the state of arizona or any gambling interests in that state
i do not
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york
i know
when do we talk
sure pete clemenza died of a heart attack but the rosato brothers gave it to him
you were unfair with them
says who
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died and then you took over and welched
clemenza promised them nothing he hated the sonsuvbitches
they feel cheated
michael you are sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family
your family still carries the name corleone and you will run it like a corleone
the rosatos are running crazy taking hostages spitting in my face because they are backed by the jew in miami
no there are things that i have planned with hyman roth i do not want them disturbed
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood
frankie you know my father respected roth did business with him
don corleone i wish you let me know you was coming we could have prepared something for you
i did not want you to know i was coming you heard what happened in my home
michael yes we was all relieved
i want you to help me take my revenge
michael anything what is it i can do for you
i want you to settle these troubles with the rosato brothers
i was just going to contact you michael we just had a sit downg in fact i just come from there
i want you to settle on their terms
mike i do not understand do not ask me to do that
i know
then why do you want me to lay down to them
frankie roth tried to have me killed i am sure it was him but i do not know yet why
my lawyer tom hagen he arranged this all through your man turnbull
i thought we would meet alone
i trust these men with my life they are my right arms i cannot insult them by sending them away
we are all part of the same hypocrisy senator but never think it applies to my family
they are still on the property maybe you better stay inside
we will try
on the phone
rosato where is your brother
he do not want to talk
we worked it all out beforehand
are we going to eat or what
sure on me i got diner s club
forget it i am suddenly without an appetite you are making big trouble carmine
you were not straight with us frankie what else could we do
we could have talked first saved a lot of running around
you was not listening you did not want to talk
pari persu what the fuck is pari persu
my lawyer went over this beforehand
what assurances do i have that there will be no more kidnapping no more hits
the same assurance we got from you
what if i say shove it
then carmine fucillo and tony blue derosa will need to be fitted for slabs
you want a war
we got friends in the commission
i am talking about italians
what about michael corleone
he supports me
that is this
i have already rented it i cannot disappoint the new tenants they are paying a higher rent
how much more a month
what was that
i accept your generosity
look at that you cannot buy better protection than that that there is your man s best friend
how are they with kids
they are great with kids they love em they eat em up i am kidding
hey c mon
give it here bernard
was that your dad
so where are all your toys
let s watch some tv
where are these toys of yours
a lot of my stuff has not been unpacked yet here s the tv

i am looking for some perfume
any particular brand
well it is for a woman
wife girlfriend or mother
and the rent is okay
right so you have a new place you have started working a bit i am sure you will be meeting some new people
actually i have met someone there s a woman i think i like
that is terrific do not be afraid to be demonstrative you are sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke
i am i am really feeling pretty good i have a much stronger sense of how far i have come
as long as you keep remembering why
i understand that
and please do not for god s sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way
that would be stupid
that would be monumentally stupid all i am saying is
a sense of proportion
things are beginning to come to a head i can feel it and i want everything to be perfect
who does not
i have cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever
ask her how she feels
i should
well can i make an appointment
oh great
yeah that was easy
do you do washing machines too
everything breaks at once
is not that always the way
i apologize for that scene with my husband you must have overheard
an occupational hazard i am afraid
i bet going into people s homes
do you have a family
uh no i have never really found the time to settle down
you must value your independence
yeah i have always been able to make my way in the world i do not like having to rely on other people
i was driving by i saw all the cars are you all right
yeah i am okay it is been a long night
what happened
i was thinking about our conversation the other day what you said about choices
uh huh
yeah you know that in life you really have to choose what you want to do
listen i am sorry but it is really late you do not have to come tomorrow to work on the floor
yeah right i really have to go to bed
about what
about us
i found a cent
hey have a nice time it is a good school
baby what is it
i am thirsty
it is the middle of the night sweetie
a man scared me
a man was it a dream
your daddy and i are kind of mad at each other right now so we have to spend some time apart
why are you mad at each other
you know how sometimes neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him
uh huh
well that is what happens with grownups too
did daddy tease you
daddy s gone where rudolf went and is not coming back
so you do not have anything concrete
no i told you a whiff of perfume on his shirt
have you just plain asked him
i am sure that is all it is honey maybe you both just need a vacation
i have tried to get him to agree to one i just i do not know i am getting such weird vibes lately
rita he is only twelve years old
c mon kids let s go
why cannot you just drive me to my old school every morning
because you would have to get up at five a m would you like that
i could take a cab on the way home
has anyone seen rudolf i do not think he came in last night
he does not have a temperature
thank god
the pocket s a cinch i will sew it up for you after dinner okay
neil you could have burned the house down

neil what
honey do you want some hot chocolate
no thanks mom i will go up to bed now
do you want me to come up and tuck you in
neil calm down
neil do not leave the back doors open i do not want holly near the pool
you are thinking exactly what i thought when i first saw this house
that is that
this is the one for us
stop knowing me so well
i know it is at the high end of our range
high end honey it is a whole new budget
but it is what we want
you wanted furniture too did not you
you could have a pool to cool off in
it is a nice pool is not it
and it is a shorter commute
we are going to think about it
how were we were we cool
paul newman in the hustler
he made you know a remark
honey are you okay
and keep my kids away from his property who the hell does he think he is some nice neighborhood
honey the meeting today is going to be fine do not get in an uproar
i know it is just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me
how was your lunch with charlie
oh great
well did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job
i hear things in this house
all new houses have noises
neil s still having a bad time at school i feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time
i mean he is a smart kid he will get by he takes after me you are too sensitive
no i am not kidding you philip
sweetheart this is a very risky time for me right now maybe you do not appreciate that
i do not care philip you want to go chasing barbara zelman go ahead just watch out for those buck teeth
barbara zelman i do not believe this
who told you that someone on the radio
i thought we would be happy here

philip the senior partner
his secretary just confirmed

that is not the case
boy you really buckle under a little pressure do not you
this is for the best you know it is why do my socks keep disappearing

there s always an excuse is not there
i think it is time i came home now
no philip i do not want you coming back here and if you want to talk to me call
oh god
should i come home when i am finished there
it is been on the market a while has not it
not very long there have been a couple of bids already
just reduced
sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment
this is a terrific entrance hall what a welcoming feeling
you will see that there s really much more space than the average three bedroom
oh space you said the right thing
how large is your brood
two three if you count the husband
god your sister s really hot
let s follow em
what for dickweed
it is fun
are we gonna buy this house
dad we cannot decide unless rudolf gets to look too
okay we have tv we can all get stupid again
what about cable
all right who ate the last piece of cheesecake
neil do you mind
i have been going through a lot of personal crap all right
if you want that baseball jacket for your birthday neil learn to cough a little more realistically
i have a cold
what did the thermometer say
y know what i am ready to cancel our trip i really am i have had it
hiya sport where would you come from huh
a man started the fire
you knew a second ago who started it
i thought i was supposed to stay in my room
and this is the master bedroom
oh yeah where is the bed
is it a king or a queen
it is a double
even better
even cosier
that is right you got the bill this morning i put it on your desk
i would like that
would you
i feel something it is faint but it is there
damn it
that is the matter
it does not say but that is not what interests me there s no death certificate for the daughter anywhere
so many unanswered questions why was she buried there and who killed her
it might have been her mother
they do not build them like this anymore
town records are coming up now
what will they tell you
i have to admit you really have a beautiful home
thank you if you told me two years ago we would be living here i would never have believed it do you live around here
i have to admit i was skeptical until now
so was i the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not
well i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us
it looks delicious
are you all right
a few years older perhaps
it will heal
i am sorry
good bye
may you find the peace you have sought in vain for so long
where does this amulet come from
the dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart according to ancient beliefs
by killing them
by freeing them
i do not understand
what do these ingredients mean
mommy the leprechauns drank the milk last night

good night angel
i could use a little help we have to return the van soon

yeah i will look into that tonight
i hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service
the place is pretty dusty
well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it was not i will have to call her
who knows we have to get used to living around here maybe good help is hard to find
that is the matter
will maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while
oh come on
i just i do not know
what will aubrey think
you did not think much about that before
it is just going to take a while
to our family
i wish i knew more about her
god rest her soul
what the hell is that
no maybe it was aubrey
she is asleep i think that is what i need too i am starting to see things
the heater s here
what is it
it was in the cellar weird
weird sounds things moving lights going off the videotape
so what are you saying
but do you agree with me
yeah i would say some weird things have happened
well i try to keep an open mind but
i do not know someone who knows about this kind of stuff
oh come on
it just disappeared literally
whoa there
what are you talking about
she has a friend colleen
a friend
how are we doing
i think everything s ready
oh my god where is she
she is gone
it does not matter to me what do you mean by that
should i
you do not think i know
nothing s changed has it you still want to deceive me
maura what is this
we are not going
we will destroy you destroy all of you
are you all right
you are bleeding
not at all i am just trying to put together all the evidence to determine what it could possibly be
we do not know
i think we should do it
we are usually successful in detecting the source of most problems unfortunately
what do you mean unfortunately
we usually find nothing we have debunked many a reported haunting about ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation
where is your daughter she might be able to give us some information
ok so we have a presence what do we do about it
i am hungry enough to eat a horse
is white meat all right for you mr shea
you must be a londrigan
at her request she was a very religious woman
oh that is nice
thank you i believe she would have wanted it
she attended the church for years a dear woman it was sad to see her decline so rapidly
it was a shame
well it is nice that you were there for her
go ahead i believe right now she may hear you
concentrate she can hear you
she is coming back keep talking
you must be the new tenants
my name is father seamus i am from holy rood church
what was she afraid of
did you have dinner father we have plenty
i hope everything works out for you and you find happiness in your new home
thank you
well there s no time like the present good night
this is not happening
what amulet
so what does that have to do with aubrey where is she
we must return it if you want your daughter back
how long will it take
keep talking
the rain is letting up
yes it is will and seamus look at each other
i do not know what happened and i do not know what you did
i did not do anything god saved her
take care of the girl take care of your family they are important
well you know where to reach me the church is a stone s throw away if you want to come to mass
and what would you do
looks like we have some animal hairs in here maybe some kind of a rodent
so is that what all this is someone have a problem with us living here
do you have any other physical evidence that we can look at
where did you find this
it was nailed to the cellar wall
do you mind if i borrow it
there s something through that wall
well what is it
yes and very beautiful
your lips they did not move
disappointing is not it to come so far and find so little jaded ingenues amusing themselves with make believe
we had feared we were the only ones
are you the leader of tis group
so you have the answers
ah you have questions
what are we
nothing if not vampires
who made us what we are
surely you know the one who made you
that is a picture nothing more
and perhaps this is the only real evil left
then god does not exist
i have not spoken to him
my god so it is as i always feared nothing leading to nothing
the one who made you should have told you this the one who left the old world for the new
he knew nothing he just did not care
i was waiting for you
claudia is dear to me my daughter
your lover
no my beloved my child
if you say so you are innocent
i am not innocent but i am afraid she feels she is in danger from the others
she is
but why
i could give you reasons her silence her youth it is forbidden to make so young so helpless that cannot survive on its own
then blame the one who made her
did you kill this vampire who made you both is that why you will not say his name santiago thinks you did
we want no quarrel with him
it is already begun if you want to save her send her away
so soon without any of those answers you so longed for
you said there were none
but you asked the wrong questions do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality how quickly they perish of their own will
that is what the one who made me said
and the vampires of the theatre
are these not the answers you came for
lestat you knew lestat
where is she where is claudia
not without claudia where is she
i cannot save her
you cannot believe i would leave without her armand you must save her you have no choice
i could not prevent it
i do not believe you i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie
louis they cannot be brought back there are some things that are impossible even for me
you held sway over them they feared you you wanted it to happen
and yet you knew what i would o
i knew i rescued you did not i from the terrible dawn
you were their leader they trusted you
your melancholy eyes
what a pair we are we deserve each other do not we
i want some more
why always on this night
what night what do you mean
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year
i did not realise
some of these are so old and tattered you should throw them away
i have or there would be twice as many
but you are the fairest by far
which of you did it which of you made me the way i am
what you are you would be something other than you are
and if i cut my hair again
you made us what we are did not you
stop her louis
why yours alone tell me how it was done
what is it now you irritate me your very presence irritates me
does it
yes and i will tell you something else i have met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you
is that supposed to frighten me
you are spoilt because you are an only child you need a brother or i do i am weary of you both
i suppose we could people the world with vampires the three of us
not you my dear
you are a liar but you upset my plans
what plans
stop pestering me then
oh lestat i must do more than that i have brought a present for you
oh claudia you have outdone yourself where did you find them
drunk on brandy wine a thimblefull i thought of you when i saw them
absinthe you gave then absinthe
do not louis
louis put me in my coffin
i want more
how did you learn to write claudia
but you never let me see you kill louis
lestat taught you all you need to know about that
infant death he calls me sweet daughter death you know what he calls you merciful death
he jests
why does he call you that
claudia you did that
you want me to be a doll forever
claudia do not
we are immortal you have always known that
you see the old woman that will never happen to you you will never grow old you will never die
you both did it
but now s the time to end it louis now s the time to leave him
lestat oh god forgive us
he is dead claudia dead
should we burn him bury him what would he have liked louis
do not mock claudia
he belongs with those reptiles louis he deserved to die
then maybe so do we every night of our lives he was my brother my maker he gave me this life whatever it is
louis look at me
you never talked to me like that in all these years
and you never cried
hush claudia hush now my dear
what was that
it cannot be
the ship is sailing wihout us
how do i look
you do not remember or you never knew
it was something hurries and seldom savoured something acute that was quickly lost it was the pale shadow of killing
or her or her or any of them
claudia you torture yourself
they are ducklings that will grow into swans whereas i must be the duckling forever
are they my kind louis dolls never change either
you know her
yes should i take her louis among her dolls make a doll of her in turn
but this cannot be real this is nonsense
mortals mortals everywhere and lots of drops to drink
they use no paint and the audience think it is paint
she is no vampire
this is no performance
this is monstrous
i have seen enough of this i loathe it
what danger
do you think i would let them harm you
no you would not louis danger hold you to me
that is not so
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word when he put me in that trance
so you felt it too
he can protect us claudia
your evil is that you cannot be evil and i will suffer for it no longer
she is dying it happened to you too but your child s mind cannot remember
but if she dies
bear me no ill will my love we are now even
they would have killed you
then my luck would have changed
who the hell are you what are you doing in my house
you are not afraid of anything are you
what do you want from me
you have to ask me for this you have to want it do you hear me
give it to me
vampires we thrive on blood
you let your overseer run riot work your slaves to the bone we will start with him
how do you mean start
let s call that a start
i cannot do it
you have just done it
you are the devil are not you that is who you are
i wish i were but if i were what would i want with you
i cannot go through with it i tell you
your perfect your bitter and you are strong
but why do you want me
you really want to be with them
yes kill me kill me like you promised
come you are going to feed now
take him
the crucifix
what have i done
dear god what have i done
yes that is you my handsome friend and you will look that way till the stars fall from heaven
you must get into it it is the only safe place for you when the light comes
and if i do not
you will get used to killing just forget about that mortal coil you will become accustomed to things all too quickly
i know it gets cold so fast
but we can live without taking human life it is possible
have you ever been caught
but how do you know
read her thoughts
i cannot
what have you done to me you have condemned me to hell
consider yourself lucky in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons here all one needs is a pair of fangs
paris you came from paris
as did the one who made me
tell me about him you must have lernt something from him it had to happen for you as it did for me
i learnt absolutely nothing i was not give a choice remember
they know about us they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses
come the new orleans then there s an opera on tonight a real french opera we can dine in splendour
i respect life do not you see for each and every human life i have respect
where are we
we belong in hell
what do you imagine you are louis
lestat she is alive
the girl lestat
lestat finish this
my god to think you are all i have to learn from
do what it is in your nature to do and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms
oh god lestat i felt peace i felt an end to the craving
is god merciless greedy and cruel
she is here your wounded one
what are you saying
you remember how you wanted her the taste of her
i did not want to kill her
claudia claudia listen to me you are ill my precious and i am going to give you what you need to get well
you are the devil you are the instrument of satan
your mama s left you with us she wants you to be happy
you are the devil you are the instrument of satan
claudia claudia will you never learn who will we get now to finish your dress a little practicality cherie
claudia do not do this thing
no you come back to me louis
i am so glad you are here louis i have dreamed of your coming
do not try to speak it is alright
i did not mean to let them do it that santiago he tricked me
that is all past lestat
still beautiful louis you always were the strong one
do not fear me lestat i bring you no harm
it is only a siren
i cannot bear it louis the machines out there that fly and that roar and such lights they make the night brighter than the day
and they frighten you
you know i love the dark but there s no dark anymore
it is false light lestat it cannot harm you
i have to go now lestat
you remember how i was louis the vampire lestat
you would have to have a lot of tape for my story i have had a very unusual life
so much the better i have got a pocket full of tapes
you followed me here did not you
saw you in the street outside you seemed interesting is this where you live
it is just a room
so shall we begin what do yo do
see i knew you were interesting you mean this literally i take it
absolutely i was watching you watching me i was waiting for you in that alleyway and then you began to speak
well what a lucky break for me
you were going to kill me drink my blood
you believe this do not you that you are a vampire you really think
we cannot begin this way let me turn on the light
but i thought vampires did not like the light
you are not lying to me are you
you said the slave had a crucifix
oh that rumour about crosses
you cannot look at them
nonsense my friend i can look on anything i like and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes
the story about stakes through the heart
the same as you would say today bull shit
what about coffins
you loved yvette
can a vampire feel love
shall we go on
but why did you tell her
how could i not she had to know
and did you lose her did she go
did he die in the fire
no vampires in transylvania no count dracula
lestat escaped the fire
no it cannot end like that
it is over i am telling you
you have not the vaguest conception under god of what you ask
what do you think she is madeleine a doll
and the child who did die
we are ready for you
why do not you take a rest brian
i am only walking him you caught him you have to be exhausted
go on you are tired
it has not adjusted
do not feel bad

calvin wants me to move the white for tomorrow
he ought to put him in here
it is too soon to move him
so tell calvin
i did he wants it on exhibit
michael take deep breaths
i have to get out of here
come on
i cannot take water kathryn
put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will
that is the big deal a shark got overman and we got the shark
that is just it michael we do not
what do you mean we do not
this tooth is from another shark a shark that could be 30 feet long
that is what i have come to ask you is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing
what did you just say before about water flowing through them
that is why they are always moving they have to have it
somebody better get down there
come on
how is he
couple of fractures lacerations they say he is gonna be all right
that is right
michael you are not going down there
i am you are not
but you
michael you do not have to go down there
i want that shark kathryn
you do not have to prove anything
are you okay
go where
on the telly we are to film him for the evening news
nobody told me
i just did can you make them do tricks
they are not tricks they are behavior patterns
fine have them do some
i do not know they are nervous and skittish right now
okay now have flipper flip or something
it is no use they will not come into the lagoon
well then can you have them jump to the camera over here
wait a minute these are not kangaroos mr hutton they are dolphins
i thought they were clever
i can have them walk backwards
no no that will not do
i told you something s upset them
well i have to get this into the networks if you cannot do it you cannot do it that is all
unhappy combination most likely one s inside the other
i think we can capture it i would like to try
you can get killed
i have handled sharks before bigger than this one
it will chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes
calvin i insist i be allowed to capture it
three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world s ever known
i will
well then i am going to film it
like hell
i want that shark alive
you look like an orange worm
shark bait draws them over for closeups
lunch for whitey something to munch on in case things get dicey
we are taking that shark alive
let s hope he knows that
i insist you get rid of that bomb
afraid i cannot do that
how is sleeping beauty
still sleeping
kiss him maybe he will turn into a frog
should be coming out of it soon
could be a new dance walking the shark
thanks for helping
not at all
why are you
i like it when they wake up
so do i but for different reasons
you were quite daring in capturing him very skillful indeed
skillful i missed my first shot
some miss all their shots
somebody could have gotten hurt
that is what life is doctor full of chances to hurt yourself or somebody else
before you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade now you are helping to nurse it back to life
i think that you and i are natural enemies
hello i think his nap s over
get ready to go
believe me i am
well doctor you have got your shark
sharks have to keep moving they can never stop or they will suffocate if water is not always flowing through them they will die
i have heard of a white that big in australia

he should have kept his head tucked down
shut up
what about him
i need to ask you questions of a psychological nature
remember when you asked for a study on him i refused same goes for now
that was peterson upstairs
it was you who did the asking
he does not think you run mind games on him
that is the bottom line
if he pushes too deep into our boy s mind set he may destroy himself what are you planning jack
could he handle a direct contact
how are molly and the boy
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out
it has to be a book the tooth fairy would know lecktor has in his cell
how long do i have
aniline dyes in the inks in felt tip pens which is what lecktor has are transparent to infrared the tooth fairy s ballpoint is not
that could be the tip of a t here and here and here
the chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the tattler right now
book code
one hundred prayers could be the page number the paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter but what book
not the bible

dear pilgrim you honor me
that is it lecktor called him a pilgrim when he was talking to me
whatever i say you will take him away will not you
i have to
you are his friend jack why cannot you leave him alone
because it is his bad luck to be special
he thinks you want him to look at evidence
nobody s better with evidence but he has the other thing too he does not like that part of it
talking about like you do not like me very much do you
no i do not like people who park in the handicapped zone
let s go to bed i will rub your back
i should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work you do not want to talk about it here

you do not need me i would not be useful to you anymore jack
last two like this we had you caught
that was three years ago and by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing

i do not know jack he is got no face for me
you can tell something about him or we would not have found the finger print
do not expect too much from me jack all right we will get him one way or the other
he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time
because he has a genuine taste for it jack
see you do know something about him
for christ s sake why
is it weird
the mark yes
if the documents section cannot do it i will send it up to langley

we know the tooth fairy reads the tattler the stuff about me and lector i do not know any other paper that carried it
there s three t s and an r in tattler
can we still get lecktor s message out of the paper
yes and i am leery of running lecktor s message without knowing what it says
and if we pull it we lose a week we only have two to the next full moon

you tell me what you know about him i will tell you whether you are right or not
let s get straight who we have talking about are you the man i am interested in
i do not think i will tell you
he is right handed
most people are
he is misunderstood
he is very strong physically
that is true
he is white and six feet tall you have not told me anything yet
describe exactly what you think he did to mrs leeds and i will tell you if you are right or not
our people swear he wore surgeons gloves the whole time they dusted everything
the report did not mention nails and eyes
why do you think he took his gloves off
he may have a history of biting barroom fights or child abuse
that is average
the commissioner was saying you were the one that caught dr lecktor three years ago he killed nine people did not he
nine that we know of two did not die
what happened to them
one s on the respirator at a hospital in baltimore the other is in a private mental hospital in denver
what did the psychologists say was wrong with lecktor
psychologists call him a sociopath they do not know what else to call him
to yourself
i call him a monster
i understand he cut you pretty good
what about the dog
it is at the vet s the kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen icepick or an awl

a a tourist
then the informant is real
does that surprise you it was inevitable
he will be contacting us again
expect it did you get anything from the room
we will need a search running
they are dead in either case
you do not know
the great morpheus we meet at last
and you are
smith i am agent smith
oh shit
lieutenant you were given specific orders
i am just doing my job you gimme that juris my dick tion and you can cram it up your ass
i sent two units they are bringing her down now
he is gonna make it
that is the third white van i have seen
who is it
you are two hours late
you got the money
hallelujah you are my savior man my own personal jesus christ
if you get caught using that
something wrong man you look a little whiter than usual
you ever have the feeling that you are not sure if you are awake or still dreaming
you were not supposed to relieve me
do not be ridiculous
we are going to kill him do you understand that he is going to die just like the others
do you
i it does not matter what i believe
you do not do you
if you have something to say i suggest you say it to morpheus
did you hear that
are you sure this line is clean
there s something about him is not there
do not tell me you are a believer now
i just keep wondering if morpheus is so sure why does not he take him to the oracle she would know
hello trinity
cypher where is tank
he had an accident
you are a beautiful woman too bad things had to work out like this
goddamn you cypher
i do not believe it i do not believe it
no it is all right
what are you doing
is that
you bet your ass it keeps him going maybe it keeps all of us going
how many were there
five since i have been here
what happened to them
thanks for the drink
there was an accident a fucking car accident all of a sudden boom jesus someone s going to make a believer out of me
i got you
just get me outta here
i know they cut the hardline this line is not a viable exit
i got a fibrillation
we found him trinity we finally found him
give me your phone
they will be able to track it
what is he doing
how long
you cannot use that until neo is out
who s coming for me
stand up and see for yourself
right now
what the fuck do they want with me
the cubicle across from you is empty
but what if
good now there is a window open it
no it is too far away
this line is tapped so i must be brief
the agents
they got to you first but they have underestimated how important you are if they knew what i know you would probably be dead
welcome neo as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus
it is an honor
i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling down the rabbit hole
ironically this is not far from the truth but i am getting ahead of myself can you tell me neo why are you here
you are morpheus you are a legend most hackers would die to meet you
why not
because i do not like the idea that i am not in control of my life
the matrix
have you ever had a dream neo that you were so sure was real
this cannot be
am i dead
what are you doing
why do my eyes hurt
morpheus that is happened to me what is this place
right now we are inside a computer program
no i do not believe it it is not possible
get some rest you are going to need it
for what
this is incredible i know kung fu
how did i beat you
you you are too fast
do you know why you did not make it
i thought it was not real
if you are killed in the matrix you die here
this is another matrix simulation a training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson
do you understand neo
i think i do
what are you trying to tell me that i can dodge bullets
set down in there
so is this the same oracle that made the uh prophecy
yes she is very old she is been with us since the beginning
the beginning
of the resistance
and she knows what everything
she would say she knows enough
and she is never wrong
do not think of it in terms of right and wrong she is a guide neo she can help you find the path
what did she tell you
and you still believe i am the one
yes i do
no no morpheus do not
how is he
got it
goddamn it is good to hear your voice sir
we need an exit
got one ready sir subway state and balbo
tank charge the e m p
i am going to make the call
i know you are neo be right with you
i would ask you to sit down but you are not going to anyway and do not worry about the vase
that vase
i said do not worry about it i will get one of my kids to fix it
so what do you think you think you are the one
okay now i am supposed to say hmmm that is interesting but then you say
but what
but you already know what i am going to tell you
i am not the one
that is funny
morpheus he almost had me convinced
i know poor morpheus without him we are lost we will never find the one
hello neo
how do you know that name
i know a lot about you i have been wanting to meet you for some time
who are you
my name is trinity
trinity the trinity the trinity that cracked the i r s kansas city would base
that was a long time ago
i just thought you were a guy
do you want to go somewhere and talk
how did you do that
right now all i can tell you is that you are in danger i brought you here to warn you
of what
they are watching you neo
it is the question that brought you here you know the question just as i did it is a hacker s question
what the hell is this
it is necessary neo for our protection
from what
what is this thing
uh oh
get this thing out of me
e m p an electromagnetic pulse
what does that mean
that the matrix cannot tell you who you are
but an oracle can
that is different
is it
are you worried
what did she tell you
are you all right
what did you just say
nothing just had a little deja vu
what happened what did you see
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it
how much like it was it the same cat
what is it
we cannot leave him
is morpheus alive
what happened
goddamnit goddamnit
that i would have to make a choice
what are you doing
i am going in after him
you cannot
i have to
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out there s no way you are going back in
no you have to be
i am sorry i am not i am just another guy morpheus is the one that matters
what are you doing
i am coming with you
neo how did you do that
do what
you moved like they moved i have never seen anyone move that fast
are you all right
can you fly that thing
if this war ended tomorrow zion is where the party would be
it is a city
the last human city the only place we got left
where is it

thank you

he is pissing in our faces again and we are just taking it
how is it working for a scumbag like this you proud of yourself
what do you think
dear detectives long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light it is the murderer s way of announcing himself
announcing what
there are seven deadly sins gluttony wrath greed
so what this victim
that is this i am declining this case it do not work that way
you have left unfinished business before
have you heard
no i have not heard
it is none of my business anymore
i thought you might want to be filled in
come on what are you going to do with yourself out there
i will get a job maybe on a farm i will work on the house
cannot you feel it yet cannot you feel that feeling you are not going to be a cop anymore
what are you talking about
i heard
i have no understanding of this place anymore
well there he sits it is not supposed to make sense
how you feeling
thank you tell them thank you
we figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house
they are hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go but i told them not to expect it
he is being arraigned tomorrow
i guess decide for yourself i do not know what it says i am going to go
and and and he said he asked me if i was married and i could see he had a gun in his hand
where was the girl
what what
she was she was on the bed she was just sitting on the bed
jesus christ man do not shoot me
turn around hands on your head
what the hell s going on
who are you what are you doing out here
this guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here he wanted it here at exactly seven o clock
what do you mean
i mean at this point what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself
that is so exciting
it is surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct
david please
give me the gun
where we headed
what makes you so special that people should pay attention
you know that is not true
you cannot see the whole the whole complete act yet not yet but when this is done it is going to be so so
a woman
delusions of grandeur
you should be thanking me
i seem to remember knocking on your door
and i remember breaking your nose you are only alive because i did not kill you
just keep leading the way
i wish i could have been a normal man like you i wish i could have a simple life
you have made a good life for yourself
here he comes
what the fuck is going on
i am a little thrown i just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here
i need to start getting the feel of it all right meet the people
i meant to ask you something mills when we spoke on the phone i cannot help wondering why here
i i do not follow
you just met me
let me tell you how i want this to go i want you to look and i want you to listen
i was not standing around guarding the local taco bell i have worked homicide for five and a half years
not here
i realize that
drop it
who said this was murder
it is a bucket of vomit
is there any blood in it
you think it was poison
is that clear
okay sure it is just that with my old partner you know
same color and texture
it could be nothing
this is his stuff i have been out in the cold all day
i am declining this case i want us reassigned
it is too soon for him
it is a package deal you get the phone with the office
i am invited to have a late supper at your house and i accept
all television does is teach children that it is really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day
what about sports
you go to movies at least
i read remember reading
you have never seen the odd couple this is sick the honeymooners
our guy got into office probably before the building closed and security tightened up gould must have been working late
he must have left another puzzle piece
look i appreciate being able to talk this out but uh
and if it is a threat
like in the parson s tale and dante
did you read them
yeah parts of them anyway in purgatory dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain seeing all these other guys who sinned
seven terraces of purgation
forced what
attrition when you regret your sins but not because you love god
no witnesses of any kind
this is the one thing
you are sure your men did not move this
what the fuck is that
there must be something
oh yeah sure you got to be kidding
he just may be nuts enough
you meant what you said to mrs gould did not you about catching this guy you really want to believe that do not you
and you do not
i wish i still thought like you
i am sorry but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues i have seen so many corpses rolled away unrevenged
does this make it with you
does not seem like our man does it
you tell me i am new in town
he does not have the desire somehow our killer seems to have more purpose more purpose than victor could ever conceive of
the fingerprints
yes they were there so it must be
why would we
it is victor
the way this has gone till now i would not have thought it was possible but we may have underestimated this guy
i want him bad i do not just want to catch him anymore i want to hurt him
listen to me he is all about playing games
no kidding no fucking kidding
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here no matter how hard it is we have to stay focused on the details
i do not know about you but i feed off my emotions
how do those cockroaches get here so quick
they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well
sorry about that i just
a landlord s dream tenant a paralyzed man with no tongue
i am sick of sitting around waiting for him to kill again
it is too dismissive to call him a lunatic we cannot make that mistake
oh blah blah blah the guy s insane
we do not know for sure
and so what
well he is been right so far has not he
how much money do you have
well that was money well spent
by telling you this i am trusting you more than i trust most people
for a long time the f b i s been hooked into the library system keeping accurate records
you got to be kidding
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable communism to violent crime
how is this legal
yeah some college student who s taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime
yeah well at least we are out of the office we have got pizza
how do you know all about this
this is a waste of time
we are focusing
i know i know focusing on one little thing
modern homicide investigation in cold blood of human bondage human bondage
it is not what you think it is
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism
that is
the writings of saint thomas aqu aquin
you are sure you are reading that right john doe
that is what it says jonathan doe
this is stupid it would be just too easy
we will take a look at him talk to him
what are you going to say
you do the talking put that old silver tongue of yours to work
are you alright
i am fine
wait just wait
it was him
the hell i cannot we get in there and we can stop him
we need a warrant
think about it
what the fuck is wrong with you
you stupid son of a
what are you talking about
we could use about fifty more men here
well there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room and near as i can tell each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages
he is preaching
you know there s not going to be a happy ending to this it is not possible anymore
if we get him i will be happy enough
no face it now stop thinking it is good guys against bad guys
how can you say that especially after today
do not try to focus on things as black and white because you will go blind there s no winning and losing here
you do your job
where is the victory
people do not want a champion they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers
he cut her up and dressed the wounds
you think you are doing me a big favor by staying
you knew i would say yes
as soon as this is over i am gone
because he is john doe by choice
you know he is fucking us
you and i are probably for the first time ever in total agreement he would not just stop
if john doe s head splits open and a u f o flies out i want you to have expected it
what is it
kiss me on the lips
throw your gun down now
throw your weapon detective now
tell me it is not true
put your gun down
do not do this please
i am sorry about this mrs gould i really am
i need you to look at each one carefully very carefully look for anything that seems strange or out of place anything at all
i do not know why why now
anything anything missing or different
i do not see anything
are you absolutely certain
it is nice to meet you my husband has told me a lot about you except your first name
oh um william
it smells good
do not worry i do not wear it at the dinner table
i was close once it just did not happen
it surprises me it really does
how long have you lived here
i do not know with this case
i mean you known this city you have been here for so long
it is a hard place
i feel strange being here with you without david knowing
perfect example
you have to put blinders on sometimes most times
i do not know why i asked you to come
i have been going to some of the schools looking for work but the conditions here are horrible
you should look into private schools
oh tracy i have to tell you i am not the one to talk to about this
neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours it was nothing new but then they heard the gun go off both barrels
did the wife confess
crime of passion

ahh tell me what do you want to do for me that is your idea
yes mikey
really how many
it was god s will
i did not go to high school
were not there high schools in el salvador
we had to work my family was poor
must have been hard being poor
i am still poor
hmmm but consuelo even though your poor do not you have any hobbies or interests or anything
no mikey
but like what do you like to do when you are not working
i am always working
but when you are not like now what do you like to do
this is work
yes you are i can tell that is the matter
mi jesus…mi jesus…
speak english
mi jesus esta muerto
consuelo i am sorry but you know if you do not speak english i cannot understand you
my jesus…
who is jesus
my baby
you have a bay
my grandchild baby
gee i did not even know you had any children but why are you so upset about jesus
he is dead
oh how did it happen
he was executed he was on death row and then he was executed
how did they execute him
jesus was not bad
maybe he was and you just did not know it
he was not
but still you cannot be sure
i am sure
but really you never know
i know
why was he on death row
consuelo what is rape exactly
sometimes i feel like my parents do not love me
i am not making fun i am showing it as it really is
you are showing how superior you are to your subject toby no but i like my subject i like these people
no you do not
the camerawork s nice
this is definitely better
yes i know…but still it should be somewhat entertaining
i mean without this footage without this rigorous documentation it would feel like exploitation
no no no no exploitation this is serious…but do not you find it a little funny too at the same time
you have got a family tragedy on your hands will you tell me that is funny about that about a kid in a coma
nothing i guess…
ok then we can invite serious intellectual types
we are not ready
hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
we are not ready
well i need to see this with an audience
that is an audience going to tell you
do not even joke about that
yes mikey
steak s really good tonight scooby good
not to be crass but what do we get out of this
we used pull
it is all about who you know
look we are not suckers everyone else is out there doing the same thing
was anyone in my room today
is everything ok
what are you going to do
we did the same thing last year also
ready for tomorrow
that is tomorrow
i can read it to you
you mean again
well i changed the ending a little
oh what happens now
well actually it is the same but longer i think it is better more raw
well then maybe you should just read the ending
but it will not make any sense if you hear it out of context
so you do not want to hear my new ending
you are tired of me i can tell
marcus i am tired that is all
you have lost interest you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex
what do you want
do not be so upset it is ok
what the fuck are you talking about that is ok
you know he hated my story also
that is not fair i was honest just because i was not sucking up like 	that bitch catherine
which is it you gotta keep your focus straight
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds
oh i know i know that well sharing your story your ups and downs and so forth can i hope be an illuminating experience
but what kind of pull did you have
i dunno

now do not take this the wrong way but you are a terminator right
yes cyberdyne systems model 101
holy shit you are really real i mean whoah you are uh like a machine underneath right but sort of alive outside
my mission is to protect you
yeah who sent you
so this other guy he is a terminator too right like you
not like me a t 1000 advanced prototype a mimetic polyalloy
what does that mean
where we going
we have to leave the city immediately and avoid the authorities
can i stop by my house
negative the t 1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there
you sure
i need a minute here okay you are telling me it can imitate anything it touches
like it could disguise itself as anything a pack of cigarettes
well why does not become a bomb or something to get me
negative the t 1000 s highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her
typically the subject being copied is terminated
terminated shit why did not you tell me we gotta right now
negative she is not a mission priority
oww why would you do that
you have to do what i say
that is one of my mission parameters
jesus you were gonna kill that guy
does it hurt
how long do you live i mean last
it someone comes off to you with an attitude you say eat me if you wanna shine them on it is hasta la vista baby
hasta la vista baby
yeah or later dickwad or if someone gets upset you say chill out like that or you can do combinations
chill out dickwad
that is great see you are getting it
we are not gonna make it are we people i mean
you do not feel any emotion about it one way or the other
torque wrench please
here i wish i coulda met my real dad
why do you cry
you mean people i do not know we just cry you know when it hurts
pain causes it
alriight my man
she intends to change the future somehow
this is tactically dangerous
drive faster
the t 1000 has the same files that i do it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson s house
i do not care we have gotta stop her
killing dyson might actually prevent the war
i will deal with the police
remember what i said you cannot
drive for a minute
will it melt in there
i am sorry john
no no no it will be okay stay with us
i have to go away john
it must end here or i am the future
your foster parents are kinda dicks right
easy money
no shit
out of the way john
no do not kill him
it john not him it
we are better off by ourselves
but it is the only proof we have to the future about the war and all that
yeah drag huh
mom you okay
i could not oh god you came here to stop me
it is okay it will by okay we will figure it out
i love you john i always have
i got it piece of cake
i know this is a dream sarah
i love you i always will
they took him from me
it is john who s the target now you have to protect him he is wide open
i know
do not quit sarah our son need you
i know but i am not as strong as i am supposed to be i cannot do it i am screwing up the mission
kyle do not go
it has helped me a lot to have a goal something to look forward to
but you have told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press
if i had there would have been some evidence they would have found something at the factory
you broke my arm
you are already dead silberman everybody here dies you know i believe that so do not fuck with me
this t 1000 what happens when you shoot it
you look like handmade shit
my cpu is a neural net processor a learning computer but skynet presets the switch to read only when we are sent out alone
the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation
why him
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor
yes it launches its icbms against their targets in russia
why attack russia
because skynet knows the russian counter strike will remove its enemies here
jesus how much do you know about dyson
i have detailed files
the cpu from the first terminator
i must be destroyed
is it safe for them here
it is finally over
it is not just a dream it is real you moron i know the date is happens
relax now sarah
where do you stand on all this
on all what
on furtwängler
you represent the united states now we have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just
that is because you had a proper upbringing
that is right i was raised very strictly so do not speak before you are spoken to
oh and do not wave your hands about
respect your elders and your betters
and no elbows on the table
eating is eating and
what does he mean too correct
do not see me to my door there s no need
when he met hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him was he pleased
lieutenant wills reporting to major arnold sir
for chrissakes i hate that shit cut it out
i am very sorry
i am steve that is your name
david david wills i am your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural affairs committee sir
sounds a lot of run so they sent the big guns to check up on me we recruiting children now
i guess so sir
you think a whole orchestra what a hundred and forty or so guys could be orchestrated
i guess it is possible
so what does the russki want
colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you
jeez and you think the british will share it with their allies
major richards said he would call to let us know
okay better question the next witness i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes
five minutes
you have a question for helmuth david
yes david
major i do not see how this line of questioning could
major this is deeply offensive and repugnant
you bet
when you question him again could you treat him with more respect
with more what more what
major he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect
david i do not understand a thing about you you are a jew are you a jew
major show me someone who has not made an anti semitic remark and i will show you the gates of paradise
hello major my name is dymshitz i am glad to see you
colonel pleasure
so major tell me have you questioned dr furtwängler
not yet
furtwängler s in a different category
but what before that turns rotten what if they surround the space with barbed wire colonel
do not talk about things you know nothing about he was in a dictatorship
this is what i am saying he must have had party contacts
no can do
let furtwängler go please
i am gonna get that fucking bandleader colonel no deal no fucking deal
okay let s see how long were you in the camp for
three months
says here because of your father that is that mean
my father was one of the officers in the plot against hitler they arrested the plotters and their families
your mother too
yes she suffered longer she was in ravensbruck
think you can get me any of that
oh yes major i have recordings of all his symphonies i kept them safe during the bombing my favourite is the seventh symphony
mine s the eleventh
but he only wrote nine major
i am kidding emmi what about a record player you have that too
no ours was damaged
that is in those files
i am sorry
major major he is here
bruckner s seventh major
do you know where the adagio begins
of course
i am sorry but i have to leave i will find other work you will have to get someone else that is all
what is this emmi
i cannot do this it is not right
that is not right
then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies
that that was a different matter i i was tricked
how come
i made no deal
i do not buy that
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape how did you do that
i do not remember in detail there were so many
did you call someone you knew
or maybe you called goebbels or goering you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them
when will my case be heard by the tribunal
your guess is as good as mine
i need to work i need to make my living i live off the generosity of friends
i do not know he was not my case why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended
it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me
why were they going to arrest you
i believe it was because of another letter i would written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies
you sure knew a lot of people in high places
steve arnold
i was warned
who warned you
goering because hinkel was working for goebbels
if it is too hot open your tie
i wish to say something
and what was that
i believe art and politics should be separate but that they were not kept separate i learned to my cost
and when did you first learn that when you sent the telegram was that the surrender signal the waving of the white flag
i have no idea what you are talking about
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal adolf hider
i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings
think carefully wilhelm maybe not in your own name but as privy councillor or vice president
no because i had only one intention my only intention whatever i did was to show that music means more than politics
tell me about von der null
von der null
yes von der null
well once he said he would read what this man wrote about me
and what did he say
he said do not mind him his job is to criticise your job is to conduct
and what happened to von der nul
i have no idea
you have really no idea i will tell you what happened he died in stalingrad
i said i have illegitimate children i do not know how many
stop this please stop this now
no i am not going to stop it hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter
okay wilhelm go home now go home and think about these past twelve years
i do not understand what you mean
those attitudes do not exist in me
i believe that but just answer the question do not give me explanations
do you know what that is
of course i know what that is
okay so what is it
bruckner s seventh the adagio
helmuth alfred rode second violinist since 1935 that is it mean second violinist
good and according to your questionnaire helmuth you never joined the nazi party
is it true you are going to interview dr furtwängler today
i will ask the questions helmuth
oh we did not play for his birthday we played the evening before it was the 19th of april not the 20th
do you know hans hinkel
do i know hans hinkel
that is what i asked
do i know hans hinkel
you seem to understand the question now how about answering it
i hear the british have his his archive files records
do you know that is in this archive
guess what i am holding in my hand you like guessing games
it is dr furtwängler s baton which i stole
the one he kept in his right hand yes you remember
yes you remember
show me
not here major there are people if anybody should see please please major
and i see what you mean you nearly poked my eyes out
exactly replaces the baton gives steve the case
great catch kid the boy runs off
you usually do not work on sunday major
oh i see he made you co operate and now are you a communist again
i can give you freedom of movement freedom to work freedom helmuth but i need something in return
the only thing i know is he is an anti semite
furtwängler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday
he did
one of your people told me
yes a corporal us army a jew he said he would seen the telegram in the chancellery
there s a rumour i do not know if it is true or not but ask him about von der null
never heard of him who is he
edwin von der null music critic he gave furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan
the miracle kid
and ask him about his private life
oh the evening before i see
was looking at furtwängler like that
i do not know what you mean major
you were in insurance before the war
right claims assessor
conscientious determined dogged
rudolf otto werner wind section since 1936 what instrument did you play
first oboe
i have your questionnaire here it says you were never a member of the nazi party
no i was never a nazi i have no interest in politics i am a musician
dr furtwängler is a great musician he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape
brave to celebrate hitler s birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute bravo
it was beethoven s ninth
you speak english do you speak english
that is in the other direction
this road it leads straight to kuwait
turn the car around
please i beg of you the american army is there i am iraqi they will kill me
think we are going to do it think we are going to war
and it is very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone it is considered offensive
well based on my knowledge of the region its culture and her people i would have to say it is a box
that is it say
it is a map i think that is what it is
a casual one
damn this is sweet we are going to be home in no time
yeah welcome to beautiful iraq land of enchantment and riches
why yes jaeger i believe it is
what are we going to do
they should not have been here
we should not have been here epps there is a war going on
this is miles from the battle lines they were probably deserters
deserters would have run they would not have engaged
what are you doing
you two fighting s not going to get us anything
not much chance of that jaeger s an idiot
he is not so
he is an idiot and he is not nearly as hard as he thinks
what kind of mine
i do not know and i was not about to mess with it
we have got rope
for climbing
what if it is a valloro 69 just going to bounce right up out of the ground explode in the air kill him and us
you just go when i say go
all right let s get out of here
there s nothing we can do
we cannot just go off and
not much of a pass
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here worn down to nothing now
the us army always an adventure
should be easy going from here stay on the pass straight to the dot
what do you figure it to be
otherwise whatever we are looking for could be anywhere
where would they go
i do not know there s a lot of space up here they could be just about
and they cannot fly around out there forever
what am i supposed to do
you ready
it will be too dark to make our way back now let s bed down for the night and head out at first light
what about the gold
what about it
maybe we should split it up now
we started this together and we are staying together so there s no point in splitting things up now
you are the one with all the ideas
you have had your say wes now leave it
maybe you have got ideas of your own for the gold maybe you have already got things worked out
maybe i do
you got no reason to hit me i am getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around
get off him
he snuck in here thinking we were asleep only i was not sleeping would have slit our throats if i had not stopped him
what happened
stop it
says he wanted food liar he wanted the gold
how is he going to want the gold he could not even know we had it
we cannot just leave him he will run back to his outfit report our position
you said he was a deserter
that is what he says he could be a spy or something
you do not know that
you are out of your mind
he is an enemy soldier
i am not going to let you kill him
we are not at war you and i and jaeger are awol we have no authority
i have got no stomach for murder
it is a combat action
it is murder and i will not be any part of it
you have got an awful lot of orders in you always giving orders
we been down this road i told you how it is unless you feel like there s something you want to do about it
no navicom a lot of good you are now epps
lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge
i am the one s got the big stick
suppose i do not go for that
then i suppose it would be insurrection and i suppose i would have to kill you i suppose
what about jaeger
wes we thought you were dead and we thought we were next hanging around to get killed would not have done anyone any good
thanks for taking care of this for me
you disappoint me epps always figured you to be a man a real bright guy i had respect for you
they will kill you you will not make it ten feet before they cut you down
just keep quiet
i have to answer him
so you can give us away
give it to me
at at at at at at at at at at
what are you doing
at at at at at
knock it off
do not get pissed at me just cause i want to be ready when this war starts
ready for what what are you supposed to be doing
i told you i am shooting iraqis
you know what i think you got schwarzkopf you did you got the general right in the ass now that is good shooting
blow me
do not worry about jaeger he uses his personality as a form of birth control
oh man you are not going to fall for that
there might be something in there
yeah the deed to the brooklyn bridge
you all want to lay off god i hope the iraqis shoot me put me out of my misery
what what
they finally start the ground war and where are we same place we have been since we got here securing freedom for the dirt
everybody s got a job to do figure it this way at least you get to go home alive

wellllll if you read it it must be true was it in the star or the enquirer
it is war people get lost all the time in war cut off
we disappear for awhile we disappear we came back nobody knows nothing
it is going to be cool wes it is all all right

it is not falling asleep you have only been standing there for three minutes
i am the one who can feel my leg and it is falling asleep
how is this going to work
me and wes each going take an end of the rope run our asses of and yank you off the mine
you are going to be fine
when we start running suck up your breath you are going to get the wind knocked out of you
you do not know that it could be a trick
this whatever it is
you are not losing trust are you
i do not hear any
do not
it is a fire fight
iraqis a bunch of them
well it is iraq i am not sure but i am guessing that has something to do with them being here
they are doing more than slapping
not enough we are out numbered and out gunned they would cut us to shreds
x marks the spot
something like that
but the white dot in the middle that is got to mean something
where is it where would it go
stay low
where the hell is it
what are we going to do what the hell are we going to do
we are not going to do anything
they are going to kill us
if they land
think there might be more iraqis
a whole lot of nothing
what are you doing
what does it look like i am doing
it looks like you are not doing anything
i am not and i am not doing anything because there s nothing down here
get up and dig
we have been digging we have been digging for hours if there was anything here to find we would have found it
must be a compartment
maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore
it is just a mongoose
is it dead
it is not like i figured it is cold and it is heavier than i imagined
i would not know i never imagined this not in my whole life did i ever imagine this
we send the gold up that is to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here
he is not going to leave us
why do i have to stay down here
jesus jaeger
i do not see how that plan s any better
all right you go up i will send up the gold then follow
what the hell took so long
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line it did not seem that long
wes might be right about that
we should head northeast
what are we going to do how are we going to find our way back
we got to go back we got to go back for wes
forget wes
we cannot just leave him
wes is dead
what do you mean no they can fly us home
they will ask questions want to know why we were out here
we will lie
first wes now you
i am not like wes wes was crazy
i am sorry about that epps
i am glad i did not have to kill you i am glad it did not come to that
yeah well me too
you still got a map on you
i do not want to die
makes two of us
i know what i did just now was crazy but you got to understand how much i want that gold
wonder how the war s going
we cannot just sit here we have got to start moving so pick
i pick that way
getting cold
it is a desert that is what deserts do at night they get cold
just let me rest for a second
we have got to keep moving while there s still light
you know what i am going to do i am just going to take a second i want to look at the gold
do not you touch it
i just want to look at it remind me of what i am dying for
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here
what do you figure it is
place all alone like that must be a boarder check point
which boarder saudi kuwait syria
we can head back for our lines and they do not even have to know about the gold
well we should identify ourselves
what did you say
i do not know something wes had taught me i think it means do not shoot we are your friends
oh god
they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them they could not tell in the dark
slip out your m 16
and then what
and then shoot them
i i never killed anyone before i told you that
cannot you
do not go bitch on me now you were going to kill me kill them
i just said i would i do not think i
an iraqi
what do we do
what do you make of them
shi ites i think
is that good or bad
i do not know they killed wes
why have not they killed us
i do not know
maybe maybe we can fight our way out
with what against how many
we cannot just sit here waiting to die
you come up with a better plan let me know
i did not say that i never said
can you ride a horse
which way do we go
damn it we lost the horses
the the gold
it was not the gold it was the claymore mine the gold s in my pack
what if it had not been wes what if i mean accidently what if i had
a car s got to come along sooner or later when it does we jack it
why do i have to lie in the road
somebody has to
yeah but why me what if the car does not stop
i am thinking about taking a trip
thought you were going to buy a car
still am there s more gold than i thought and since there s only two of us now where should i go
i do not know
i have never been anywhere i would not know where to go where would you go
well this is it we get the car find some americans we find americans we will be all right
epps i do not think he is slowing down
he is not slowing
hey jaeger that is up
that should not be too hard to read iraq is the pink thing
planning on going to war all by your lonesome
just want to be ready when we do
ready for what sight seeing
some good ones
they are all good ones satellites we have got can snap a shot of the boil on saddam s ass
could you stop please you are giving me a headache
a headache
people are suffering
when do you ever point the soles of your feet at people
i am saying do not do it accidently
come on you are going to get us in trouble
it was an accident you saw it was an accident
spanish was not hard enough
what does that mean
do not shoot me i am friendly you can use that when you surrender
how do you say come here baby i am horny i can use that now
what is this
now you need me
he says it is a box
yeah you are funny
it is a puzzle box if you can figure out how to open it there s supposed to be a treasure inside
and you are the guy who s going to open it
you get it yet
naw nothing
you will you will get it
i will show epps he will be sorry when i get this thing open
you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait
yeah so
that is in two days
like i said so
they are cancelling all leaves all passes no more drills we stand at full ready starting
that is your point wes you have a point
we are going to war are not we if they are doing all that it must mean we are going to war
it does not mean anything
you ever think about dying
come on man i almost had this thing open
at at at at at
this is so weird it is happening but it is not it is like a tv show and we are part of it
the longer the air force hits the iraqis the safer it ii be for us when we have to engage
it is it is i do not know what it is
that is it it is over eighteen hours into the war and it is over
you are not saying what i think you are saying i cannot believe you are even thinking it
it is right here this region an nagaf i got recon photos there are no troops there no fighting
you do not know where the iraqis have moved to and our forces have not even engaged the republican guard yet we do not know
epps you are smarter than this jaeger i understand but you are smarter
you know it is real you know it is real and you know it is there you know it
we are going to get court martialed you know that
epps is that a sand dune
hey wes what kind of treasure you figure these people buried
if if there s a treasure
yeah if whatever what kind you figure it is
i do not know it would be small easy to transport and hide gold or jewels probably gold
yeah gold how much
if there s gold if
oh god
two vehicles they are not supposed to be here
oh jesus
yeah yeah
i think i am going to throw up i am i am going to toss
i thought we were dead
yeah well we are not
we have to go back
we are not going anywhere not until we get what we came for
so you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere
we are not stranded we have got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back
then lets go back while we still can
you have to go with us wes
really what is that an order private
how long we going to keep this up
until we are out of the mine field is how long
have not found a mine for half a mile or more
that do not mean nothing iraqis could have just spread them out like that make us think we are in the clear
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself
i am getting tired of you riding me jaeger
is there anything you do know
we are american soldiers we do not abandon people
funny you should say that while we are out looking for gold
you are the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad
think we can make it
maybe they are as scared of us as we are of them
what do you think
it is got a bottom
you down
yeah we are down
what the hell are you doing
with what he does not have a weapon
says he is one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter
maybe we should give him some water
all last night he could have been
i think he wants something to drink
so we will take him with us at least until we get back to the hummer
maybe we ought to you know bury him say some words over him
you are going to burn up in those
think the iraqi s killed them all
we had to take shelter in the checkpoint jesus wes i killed the iraqis in there
but you are irish
you will put your clothes here
there s no mirror
i can manage
he is a pyjama case really
do you know you have lovely hair even if you torment it in those braids
i like plaits
curled up on the landing like love locked out
i did like the music
he cannot abide a woman in trousers he says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature
is there anything else i should know about him
mummy was scared of him i think he went to her wedding but he was furious you can see it in the photograph
he made that in his off hours
it is as though he would trapped a real cuckoo inside
do not fret it is only his dream dreams are not catching not like measles
i want to go home
home is where the heart is
she is not accustomed to being ignored
she will have to learn
what was that in aid of
is that all
finn there s a splinter in your left foot if you do not let me take the splinter out it will fester
go away
i will not do it because he wants me to do it even if i want to do it
do what oh i see
you are only a young thing
you are not so old yourself
who s there
can i come into bed with you for a little while i feel terrible
well yes all right but
you are cold where have you been
i finished it off
he will murder you when he finds out
he will be looking for another apprentice
i hope he does not pick on jonathon
the swan was so ridiculous all the same it did scare me
stop it
somebody could not wait until dark
h m
nothing you should not have given victoria that guinness
it was only a mouthful
i thought she was fondest of you because you were the youngest
did you now
surely she is older
how long has
i already lost everything once
so did i
but then i had a brother and a sister left
so had i
everything is gone now
they are going to fly everywhere mean things they should have taken us
we are too young
i am not too young juliet was my age
i am melanie
you are well built how old are you
sixteen well nearly sixteen
oh no you cannot get on with the painting
you did break in
tried to cannot quite make the connection with that sucker though if i had a direct terminal
are you embezzling
embezzling is such an ugly word mister bailey no actually i am trying to get a legal brief together
i do not get it
senior exec
oh my meanwhile kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and i am not seeing one dime
i still do not get why you are trying to break into the system
not if my tron program was running that would seal the system off if your file s in there
hi alan
my dinner
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health
want one
flynn i made it i worked out some new codes for tron put em on a disk and it is running
your old files
and dillinger s instructions to divert them it is all there look even his home phone number when he logged on
should not you wait till your lawsuit is settled
how is it going upstairs
did you say group 7 access
yeah pain in the neck you know i was all set
flynn had group 7 access
flynn had access to you too i am not interested in talking about him
oh i wish you would forget about that it was all so long ago i have totally gotten over it
okay okay
i want to go to his place
you call that getting over it
what for
to warn him
of what
for what
i do not think i am cleared for this
hello alan
great can it send me to hawaii
ever since he got that master control program set up system s got more bugs than a bait store
well you have to expect some static computers are just machines after all they cannot think
come on in
alan alan bailey
mmm part of the master control program
no it will run independently it can watchdog the mcp as well
what do you mean yes
that all you can say
no nyet negatory not on your tintype no way
oh anything else
oui da yessiree sure nuff you betcha
only yes and no you are a bit
for sure
i am your program
right on the money
way to go we are haulin
this honey does not handle so good in town
this town s full o live ones
you said it
no problem master c if you have seen one consumer electronics show that is up
yes it felt like flynn
he is still looking for that old file cannot you just appropriate it
i would if i could find it it is stashed somewhere off in the system out of my range meanwhile
meanwhile he might find it
i am afraid so i spotted him this time and kicked him out but he is getting trickier all the time
i think we would better shut off all access till we can find that file just to be safe
ed i am so very disappointed in you
it is my fault i programmed you to want so much
and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week
the pentagon
it should not be any harder than general motors was but now this is what i get for using humans
now wait a minute i wrote you
i have gotten 2 415 times smarter since then
if you think
you would not want me to dig up flynn s file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times would you
you would not dare
walter i sympathize but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy
that mcp you know that is half the problem right
the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do i cannot sit and worry about every little user request that
user requests are what computers are for
oh i know all that sometimes i wish i was back in that garage
that was uncalled for
i am sorry walt so much pressure lately you feel like going for a drink
i have come to communicate with my user
really you would have programs lined up around the block to use this place and no mcp looking over your shoulder
who is your user program
alan one he calls me may i pass
no tron must destroy mcp first
dumont where is yori where is flynn
where did you hear that name
well is not it
the name of my user yeah but how
that is that
how about over there that empty memory
greetings program
you are alive
flynn where is ram
no big deal i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine i mean i did write the program for it
wrote the
but if you are a user then everything you have done has been part of a plan
well that is how it is for programs yes but
i hate to disappoint you pal most the time that is how it is for users too
we are on our way alan one gave me the coding we need to go up against master
what about our friend sark
probably decided not to pursue us the sea of simulation is tricky lot of illusions rough navigating programs have a way of just disappearing here
not us i hope
hey you guys ok
how about you
a user in our world
boy the view from up here you know the territory
a little over there the mountains of data and i think that is the silicon valley
the mcp blasted it there are very few domains left with any power at all
there s another beam
how did you do that flynn
elementary physics a beam of energy can always be diverted ooh my head are we there yet mommy
flynn we have got to help him
yori steer us over the beam right next to it
you will be having plenty of chances to get hurt do not worry about that
look just so i can tell my friends what this dream was about okay where am i
you are a guest of the master control program they are going to make you play video games
yeah yeah that is great
how about yourself
he was disoriented in transport tron
it is all circuits must be an input output component
the tower yes flynn have you remembered anything else about yourself like what sector you are from
well my home sector was called paramus
paramus wonder what those initials stand for probably program assist routine well it sounds like a lovely place
feel what you okay
that is going on
we are inside a recognizer you are crazy stealing a recognizer
damn never fails minute the warranty runs out
hey good to see you guys nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple
we have to talk
so how is the world of serious science
have you been sneaking into the icom system
you can see why all his friends are fourteen years old
i am afraid it is a little late for that dillinger s shut off group 7 access he must know what you are up to
do not even say that you have got to find that file before he does
okay flynn i am gonna put you at my terminal down in the laser lab we will be up in alan s office
swell i will log us both on and you can get your tron thing running
you have any idea how much i can sue these jokers for
well just do not forget your old friends when you are rich and famous
hey you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games cheap
thank you master control
you have got it i have been hoping you would send me somebody with a little moxie what kind of program is he
but what if i cannot
wait i need that
yes acknowledge master control
now sir we did take care of that user you sent us
yes and now you have got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation
we will get them sir these things take time
new guy
another free program off line that is his user s posed to do
the users you really think they are still there
what do you think
you think we can make it there
do you know what he is talking about
yori hey
my quarters
why is everything like this
you have grown big program
yes it can take us across the sea of simulation all the way out of the game grid to the mcp
this is flynn the one who busted me out
what is it
power surge the transmission beam s too strong
we have to get off this beam
it is something users do
what about tipping off yurovich
who the hell s out there what are the arbs saying it is gotta be a big hitter
fox says bluestar just hit 23 what do you want him to do

you are right mr mannheim but you gotta get to the big time first then you can be a pillar and do good things

cards are on the table what do you think
it is only two hours away
i know that
i will come back all the time

oh if i could do that i would i would turn burglekutt into a toad
you are you the mother of that child
i cannot
i cannot

gawd you are beautiful
mmmm i love the smell of a woman
i do what i am told
you are a fool now put her back
why did you say that

because it is true
we will probably die here sorsha
willow why do not you use your mag ic to get us out of here
he is no magician
then you get us out of here
who is that girl anyway
we are a tiny version of all that
bavmorda cannot transform you i have protected this camp with a spell
please i am dying of thirst in here
do not make me angry peck
you be careful i am a powerful sorcerer i could turn you into a toad just like that
hey somebody s coming
thanks for your help peck
are you okay
as if you care i saved your life peck those guys woulda killed us you wanna give your baby to them they eat babies
you all right
smells like a battle
are you a warrior
that is that i hear something
you hear trouble
whatcha thinking about willow
you gotta promise to feed her
i will
and give her a bath everyday and do not let her get cold and keep her diaper changed
hey give me that baby
time to change her diaper
because she is sick
where is the baby
now willow i know you are gonna blame me for this but it was not my fault
when i left the crossroads i got ambushed by an elf
madmartigan you saved her life
so you are on your way to tir asleen huh i hate to tell you this willow but tir asleen dos not exist
yes it does the fairy queen told me
madmartigan i need your help
i will help you
i am beginning to think you two deserve to be locked up
she asked about you madmartigan
she is in love
madmartigan i cannot stand being in closed in places
want me to carry elora
willow this may be a bad time to ask this question but what if raziel s wrong
she cannot be wrong she is a very very very powerful sorceress
she is a bird willow
that is my fault not hers i have got to keep practicing i am still in the learning stage but magic madmartigan requires concentration and
i have an idea back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs
willow this is war not agricul ture
it is not a nelwyn baby
cannot we keep it dada
dada that is a daikini
daikinis are giant people who live far far away
i could be you rguard i could carry your spear
who are you who are you
what do you want
you must learn magic
that is all i ever wanted
willow to learn magic first you must make your own philosopher s stone
what do i need for that
i hope she is all right how much more do i have to do of this
till it is in a powder the energy exits within you
i know and the magician s goal is to find his true self but that is this got to do with it
i am all finished now what
how am i gonna do that
we do not have much time left go on go on
i must concetrate my imagination to creat a new reality
that is the magician s weapon
your will your will what else could it be
i cannot remember all these things what am i learning
oooh this smells terrible
what would you bit me for
again what is the magician s weapon
his will
i just wanted to test it first
tir asleen

raziel i transformed them all i am a magician
i have come all this way and now elora dana s going to die
