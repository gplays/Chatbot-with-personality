amanda ripleymcclaren  married name i guess  age  sixtysix at time of death  two years ago  i am sorry

i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you
uhhunh  one of thirty or so all over the planet  they are completely automated  we manufacture them by the way
yeah  maybe the organisms like the heat that is why they built
why not
this is clearly an important species we are dealing with here we cannot just arbitrarily exterminate them 
do not make me pull rank ripley
what rank  i believe corporal hicks has authority here
corporal hicks
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command  right
you have been doing your homework look they cannot impound it if they do not know about it
you sent them to that ship  i just checked the colony log directive dates sixtwelveseventynine signed burke carter j

it is ten thirty in the morning
yeah if you have slept
you know the law  no liquor before noon could lose my license
do not you mean do not need no liquor license not taken away from me
i am  i am sorry
what do we do
whoever it is is not shooting at us
it was the grenade you fucking idiot look at him
maybe he will be there either way we have to go
maybe he is dead too maybe you killed them both mueller 
can anybody hear me
we found him like this 
we found him like this kendall was with me the whole  listen to me
before or after the explosion  mueller 
i do not know
shut up mueller
we do not know west is dead
what do you mean alone
we found him like this
shut up  west's dead
i asked for a policeman
you are under military arrest it is not gonna happen that is wrong with baseball
it is too slow
well it is a game of anticipation that is the beauty
i just do not like it
what do you like then
c'mon ray everyone hates the army during basic i will tell you straight i hated it here
you did basic here
they are dead are not they
i am not telling you what happened
okay but i would like to know about the other cadets what they were like  nice guys
yeah and that is all i am saying
that son of a bitch
that would be my reaction too 
he is lying
well why did not you say so we will just drop all your charges then 
i am serious 
yeah we know pike did
you saw west's body
of course 
they would have killed us both you want me to write a confession i will write a confession
you saved kendall's life 
but not pike's
you wanna bet
oh you do not what else do you have on me you have not found any bodies yet have you
we have found all of them
do what
hunting  we had to hunt him 
and the bodies
you will not find them will not find west either he is too good
washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead
he is telling the truth up to a point
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
there were six of us
no did he tell you about it about the business childs ran
what business
pills shots you name it basic's a lot easier when you do not feel pain 
one went off yeah but it did not touch him  i thought you knew this 
mueller was alone in the cabin
would you have believed me
we can prove that you are not ray dunbar impersonating a fellow cadet is a courtmartial in and of itself 
how do you know that
sir dunbar sir
you know how to work a pistol dunbar
sir yes sir
the rest of you fallout for physicals
your weapons sergeant
oh bullshit he is a fucking convict you know how much he hated west 
west he is dead
so did we why did not you come
west's any kindling for afire
i mean i killed him  is not that what we all wanted
wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place it is getting bad out there   where is west
we just want to check your pack 
do i
you hated west more than any of us
maybe but that do not make me a killer 
you are the only one missing a grenade
which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper were you watching your pack on the ride in
who you gonna trust ray him or your friend
enough to go to prison childs' px scam mueller was in on it 
you are lying 
pull up my sleeve right arm
becoming a morphine addict during basic ai not exactly something you want to broadcast only mueller and childs know
you saw west right how was he killed
full clip to the body 
from up close or far away
his chest was hamburger 
what do not you know
this is a lot of information to be getting i have to think 
put it down
coast guard special detective detail we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk
but not the only victim right
what happened to degrees
i did not kill him 
then who did
no poetic justice though
right in front of us mueller went after him but we held him back
mr hardy
how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten
can i go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot
my heart weeps
there's that word again  as i told you i was not in the room when everyone started shooting
i was just thinking of that is going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
i did not do anything 
because i was standing next to him
i did not 
but you cannot prove it you cannot prove anything until we find the bodies
i do not know 
where are they
maybe he
been better  i read about that is been happening with you i should have called 
what kind of trouble are you in
would i have called you if it was not if there was any other way 
tell me what i can do
and here you are going out of house how is that make you feel jules
cadet roberto r nunez killed right in front of me
the guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop
and i am the closest thing to it right
he can wait kendall's out of surgery
who killed pike
someone must have got a shot off he was not exactly a moving target
there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it
habeas corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime
okay then let's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car 
without the body we have no physical proof we need a confession
not for me
jag gets here in three hours try for the confession
home i am done
what about the confession
was dead right you think dunbar's on the level
maybe but it is my fault and i will carry it
the senator
do not be i am not cut out to deal with the west's of the world
you are a good soldier bill
i thought you said that was not a compliment
i am not going to cover for you bill not for this
or what you have gone round the bend 
west had a partner someone who knew how to get things done
get your hands away from the desk
fantastic you want to tell me that is going on
you knew sergeant west
he was our drill here mangs older than sand
sergeant west's served for twenty three years he is the public face of the modern army
and you notice i am not in the army anymore
you and the colonel go back
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff i owe him
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside i am not comfortable having you involved in this
subtlety really is not one of you finer points is it osborne
levi who names their kid levi 
senator jonathan kendall of ohio
christ remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone 
excuse me
is dunbar cute
that is the most unprofessional 
something like that
you made me look like an idiot 
you are right we should sit in silence
we are in the middle of a murder case 
best time for banal chitchat
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
something like that you
i lost a bet
the very same
you do understand that there's absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right
i plan to grow on you
you are off to a late start
so noted
imagine what it must have been like for them out there what do you think of dunbar
he is telling the truth up to a point
what point
being back here gives me the willies
not the happiest of memories
got it
have no fear osborne we have not yet begun to fight
i lied wait for it
i do not think that has anything to do with 
everyone's capable of murder osborne
i do not know
watch me
you said you owed styles and now you are gonna turn your back on him
phenomenal at taking bribes right
what happened next
and if they are asked that is what they will tell the world
buttfucks the cabin
little bit
let's go talk to bill
they got their stories straight
positive hardy they planned this
good idea
you could not have known 
yeah i could have should have
you wanted to get the truth
now i go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
think it will work
that is gonna stay my secret
right back where we started
is not this how your story goes
hardy for chrissakes 
where is west's body
no death certificates no crime
there are degrees of truth officer always degrees
you are a good man hardy
yeah i can wait till you are off the base and do it myself
leaving without saying goodbye what are you gonna do
go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
think it will work
in case you need me to testify about the shooting they will clear you
yeah but he was a lot of other things too thanks
what are you talking about
although that will not matter much when coupled with the murder charge 
the faggot speaks
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
poor fucker my ass
you better watch it faggot i am not sure you and childs did not do him 
yeah and he does not know when 
i remember now it was before the explosion 
oh you remember now 
i am about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly 
so you took off your shirt
what the truth please there are degrees of truth officer always degrees things are not what they seem
he wanted more than that
you are gonna die tonight faggot clear as day
no one else heard it
he whispered it in my ear
because he would shot mueller
but you did not see it right
we have been making progress i see
fifty minutes
then he is mistaken you know i really do not think my father would approve of this line of questioning 
wrong answer 
we did get our stories straight but not because we killed anyone  it was because i threatened him
he came after us and i told dunbar he had to kill him
toughens us up pike you do not like it quit
blame the nigger then huh someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd 
what the fuck are you doing
shut the fuck up  he was gonna cut him loose
i used it to start the fire 
we are not going anywhere
the fuck are you talking about 
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard 
shut up
 failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself 
no no that was cadet dunbar 
you mean ray dunbar well that ai not right
he asked to see a policeman we are getting him a policeman
but this guy you called he is not even army 
then it is unofficial
it is too neat
he tried to burn dunbar to us you do not do that if you are not involved
i am giving you a chance to walk away
the army kicked you out for drugs
we were worried to death  it is awfully kind of you
you certainly have a nice place here
well stocked
if he will not cooperate
mr sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated  we will appreciate him and he will cooperate
i do not think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us
not to be trapped
you underestimate the trap mary
then go get him
that would not be very sporting
here's your check my boy  thank you
it is not an easy thing to meet your maker
and what can he do for you
can the maker repair what he makes
would you like to be modified
had in mind something a little more radical
that is the problem
come here
i am
also extraordinary things
nothing the god of biomechanics would not let you in heaven for
if it would not be too much of a bother a little bite to eat would be
oh no bother i would be glad to
well actually
you are just all so so different
you are androids
nexus  6
like what
you mean that you cannot come here and i cannot go there
not only that but we have smiliar problems  accelerated decrepitude but we do not want to die quite yet
of course not
you could help us
i do not know much about biomechanics roy  i wish i did but you are out of my league
if we do not find help soon pris has not got long to live
dr tyrell
tyrell could help us sebastian
he could
his company made us
i would be happy to mention it to him
be better if i could talk to him in person  but he is not an easy man to get to
this afternoon
thank you
just thought i would
no you stay here with us  out last night together
he is not ready yet
hello glad to meet you

considering the nature of your work that could be unhealthy
they will change the limit before i change my mind

too old
but if you could
me too
of course
nothing  she wanted to know about suck night
what night
lots of places  the tours the clubs the silicone shows private parties

i do not know nothing about it
you have not felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way
for holes
of course he is not real  you think i would be working here if i could afford a real snake
it is a good job
you mean the snake
does it eat
come on
i bet i would
little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress
of course not
why should i be
for the responsibility of your power  being a police bureaucrat you have got more than your share
you have a little boy  he shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar
you are watching tv and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist
i would kill it
is this testing whether i am an android or a lesbian
i would never get an abortion
why not
that would be murder mr deckard
in your opinion
it would be my child
sounds like you speaks from experience
i know you think it complicates your work but i am here to help
i have already got more help than i need
i think you need more help than you have got
two of us might be more effective than one
i work alone
can you  i could not
what do you want me to do
there's a lot i have not done with a man before
you did
you did not hear me  you were sleeping
me and my dad
where is he
i am  part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out
how are you doing
not too good
if they are smart they take naps
yeah  sometimes
i wish i could
it was not very good last night was it
do not be fooled by appearances
it appears to be dirty  why do not you get somebody
i do not like people snooping around my stuff
never mind the plug just go through the motions
but then how can you
i do not like the noise  just practice  practice makes perfect
good for a smart girl to feel stupid  part of your education
i never felt better
you mean a woman
ten years
nope  nobody could stand me that long
because it is not
do not you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
andies only simulate suffering  if they are programmed for it
do you think i simulated what happened between us
no i do not
what difference will it make
just wait here
you know where i been  i been on vacation
next time you go on vacation do me a favor let us know where it is
that is up
holden got hit
i will see you in a minute
go ahead
have you ever retired a human by mistake
nothing is infallible but so far the voightkampff scale bas been foolproof
like you said mr deckard a machine can be a hazard  the voightkampff scale is a machine is not it
one that relies on human interpretation  where is the subject
sitting next to you
the machine works  she is
memory implant  she was programmed but i think she has transcended her conditioning  i think she was beginning to suspect
five maybe six
how do you know i am not
you are not responding to the stimulus  i can see right here i am not getting a reading
i am tired of this
almost through
do not move
reaction time is a factor in this so please pay attention  answer quickly as you can

sun city i have been meaning to call you for months

how long have you worked at the casino
coming up to two years now  but i was away for six months
you have done pretty well
not bad i have other interests of course
no thanks matt i need my eight hours
what the fuck are you talking about
that greek guy who won at the end you paid him out in 25s not 20s
i do not cheat jack you have got it wrong
i am not going to report it
if i see you do it again i will report it
i do not know what that means i am talking about not rocking the boat
mostly people in the casino business a few drug dealers
and the girls
just girls what are you drinking
vodka straight on the rocks
good call help yourself
that bitch no
no thanks
do not worry i will not report you
i do not gamble
do not worry
rough life jack
i will tell you later
what are you talking about it is 11 i have won with this lady

i put them on together
i am afraid that is not so sir
wait a minute you got yourself barred
it was you you shit
i was at beadles
i do not think i know that one private i suppose
we tried but there was not enough business the punters like company

we had the same rule at sun city but it was impossible to check
this is not south africa we would know because someone would report it believe me someone always does
does know or does report what would happen if i knew something like that and did not report it

donnie donnie darko
a wormhole with an einsteinrosen bridge which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man
so that is it
a metal craft of any kind
like a spear
beg pardon
like a spear that comes out of your stomach
that is highly unlikely you are talking about an act of god
if god controls time then all time is predecided then every living thing travels along a set path

grandma death

i will buy that black's always good
we did talk about naomi
i said are you sure you seem unsure
i am sure i said
but you were not i could tell
i was so nervous i remember i could not think of anything to say there were long silences
so what infatuation is good too
and i did not have an argument
come up and see me now
it is very late
yes exactly exactly my point
is that what you want
i did it i guess that means something
well you are married
not yet not married
i had you pegged did not i
you had the whole human race pegged
i know
it would be different if we could just give it another go around
remember me try your best maybe we can
yeah i know i am fishing
you said 
i am joel
yeah like that
i know
what do we do
enjoy it say goodbye
i know what you mean that is why i stopped
but my sleeping is really fucked up
i do not think i have slept in a year
i love her
me too there's this poem 
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
i think before
seems too coincidental that way
yeah maybe
yeah yeah it goes perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines
um no
let's move into this neighborhood
it is freezing out here
i hesitated for what seemed like forever
i could see you wanted to come in joel
i knew by your nervousness that naomi was not the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
it is dark
yeah that is your girlfriend's name
i think we should go
i walked out the door there's no more memory
come back and make up a goodbye at least let's pretend we had one
i love you
i do not know
what if
joel come here please
make love
have sex y'know 
oh um
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now
that is okay i 
 and i am just too nervous around you right now
i am nervous too
yeah i would not have thought that
well you obviously do not know me
i am nervous because i have and enormous crush on you
says you were a bully
a bully moi
that is what it says you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
well sounds like me sorry man  says you were jealous and suspicious
says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it
i do not know
does not sound like me
says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
yay meet me after work by the old mill
what old mill is that somewhere we 
i just wanted to say that come by my house
i just walked in
hmmm do you miss me

it will not stop it goes on and on and on
what does
the dark inside me
the dark inside i do not understand
from the other place
i built it
we still have pressure the radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour
background radiation perfectly safe
that is the second containment seal beyond that engineering
i am going in
start the countdown
almost done i just gotta check one thing
justin i will not let you die
dr weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
the crew could they still be alive
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months they are been gone seven years
someone sent that message admiral you have to put me on that ship
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers  good for four months
i put in for a replacement for you but no one
clear and open on my mark three two one mark
ice crystals everywhere this place is a deep freeze
so where are they starck any luck with the bioscan
i do not know this place is really dark i cannot see a thing
starck you still showing those readings
there's no one here skipper
what you got peters
the science workstation has power i will see if i can find the crew from here
how is the client
yeah i am  i am okay
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
fine starck i want you to repeat the bioscan
do it
i will get back to the log but on the bridge i will not go back back in there
until then do what you are told and stay out of my way
that is what we are here to find out
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
be careful it is not a load bearing structure
captain i did not come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
once the ship is secured we will bring you on board 
that is not acceptable 
peters and i will search the forward decks justin take engineering no hotdogging not on this one alright
captain miller the foredecks are just ahead
they are empty dr weir moving forward
dr weir's right get on board the event horizon i will meet you at the airlock
it is complicated
how much time do you need we have seventeen hours and fortytwo minutes now what is in the core
if it worked yes
there's no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields it is under control
the date
what about it
the event horizongs computer think's it is 2034
it is 2041
exactly the ship's internal clock is off by seven years
i do not know
check the core for radiation carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
do it
justin just tried to kill himself the man is clearly insane
you said this ship creates a gateway
i do not know
where has it been for the past seven years
i do not know
the other place what is that
you cannot your orders are specific
it is done
watch me
son of a bitch
i do not need them anymore where we are going we will not need eyes to see
what are you talking about
what makes you think i will miss
then who the fuck are you
your fear do you remember the goliath miller
you know
you want me to believe you are the devil well i do not that is bullshit
i am not the devil
then what what are you tell me
better if i just show you
you are lying
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
onefour degrees
something like that yeah
yes sir
dr weir
i noticed starck anybody home
where is it
love to
starck give me a read
smith where the hell have you been
we have a situation here
we do not have time to fart
they are gone
i am here smith how is the clark
captain we got a problem
now what
she was right behind me i turn around she is gone she could be anywhere
alright prep the clark for launch i will find her
i just saw weir i think he was messing around on the clark
come again skipper
one of the explosives is missing from the corridor i think weir may have put it on the clark
no no we just got her back together
get out of there now
smith smith fuck
let's go
i just finished drying
then what are you doing here come on people let's go  and cooper put some pants on
come around to threethreefour
radiation interference
keep your eyes open
we are all here
okay let's find out how much time we just bought
but you can breathe it
oxygen is not the problem
carbon dioxide
it is building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot
we can take the filters from the clark
i do not know but whatever it is it is not the crew
do it dr weir
no it was someone else
i ran the bioscan with the dnarna filter the results were bioreadings of indeterminate origin
bioreadings of indeterminate origin do not you have anything useful to tell me
i have got a theory
to what what are you saying this ship is alive
starck do you know how crazy that sounds it is impossible
i know that
i thought you wanted an answer and that is the only one i have
nine hours and twentytwo minutes
that is going on in there starck
justings in the airlock
stay here do not stop working
you better hurry he is engaged the override we cannot open the inner door
five seconds
whatever was on that bridge was not weir
we have got to shut it down we have got to
blow it up
no i will be right back
repeat we are armed
miller he is back he was in the tank
he served on the goliath
was not that ship destroyed
they are explosive charges
you are at the bridge ms peters you still have not seen any crew
blood looks like arterial spray
can you see a body
there's no one here
i did
i have seen bodies before this is different
not according to the computer
can you shut it down
keep him talking
do you know what it was
come on babybear open this door
skipper justin just activated the door it is on a thirty second delay
it is cold
i do not care
dead ahead 5000 meters
she is not ugly
that is the core the gravity drive the heart of the ship
we are losing atmosphere
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
hey you do not need to be a scientist figure it out
all boards are green everything's five by five
the law of relativity prohibits faster thanlight travel
range 3000 meters and closing
1000 meters
picking up magnetic interference
explosive decompression
decompression would not do that
get them back 
i am trying goddammit 
i do not think this is a good idea we do not even know what happened on that ship
wrong the shortest distance between two points
do they have pressure
ship's log
i do not know the life readings just went off the scale
yes i miss her she died two years now
i am sorry
it wants me i have to go
i am alright please
the forward airlock
miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock
it means nothing
i am as he made me in his own image
you drove him to his torment
and he drove me to mine
then why weep for him
would you not he was father and mother we fell from grace together he from his god i from mine
what kindness
build for him a pyre light up the sky with his passing
better that way for me
it cannot be as bad as that
yes i have been seeking my friends
friends do they live around here
yes very close
why do you not go to them
i am afraid
you speak
kill me and have done with it
kill you hardly that
then why am i here what did you want with me
your crime as well as mine
how dare you you are disgusting and evil
evil  do you believe in evil
i see it before me
there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand
you are wrong do you know i knew how to play this
then perhaps i believe in evil after all
there is something i want  a friend
like you oh god you do not know what you are asking
i will be waiting and watching
her body pleases me
a brain extremities
this was not taken from a grave
what does it matter she will live again you will make her
no i draw the line
i will not kill me now
she is not for you
i am sure the lady knows her own mind does not she let her decide the proper suitor
she will never be yours she said my name she remembers
there there shhh
quite right
scandalous what would your dear mother say
onetwothree onetwothree twirl twothree
and you look so lovely
he was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a pompous  fellow
it is been months it is not like him
something's wrong i know it  i have heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg
so have i
i should go i should leave today
he set things right with a proper apology and now they have put him in charge of dissection lab
is he not back yet
claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time they say he never arrived
it is far too late for him to still be out
are not you
nothing can not ever
it is not ours to decide all that live must die it is god's will
the world is a dizzying place
quite a sendoff is not it
father's so proud
and you
prouder still you will be the handsomest student there
i will have to do better than that
you will  what do you want victor
all my life i have known
is that what makes it so delicious
i wish to be your husband
i wish to be your wife
then come with me to ingolstadt marry me now
i will be here when you return
not as weak as i
your decision for us
i give you my soul
until our wedding night when our bodies will join
victor i love you
elizabeth my more than sister
but why risk yourself has not this family suffered enough
i have no choice
if what you say is true it is a matter for the police
they have done a fine job hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend
i know only that he is a killer and i shall bring back his carcass
i am all right i am safe
it is not something i can explain now perhaps someday
what of our marriage victor we have had so much tragedy i want this family to live again
so do i
we need each other now i need your comfort and strength not separation and solitude
why the change what about your work
it was misguided and pointless is your answer yes
it is
we will leave this afternoon right after the ceremony pack only what you need
does this have something to do with that man you saw
yes we are in danger here every moment we stay
victor tell me why trust me
i do but you must trust me for now
now husband and wife
it would not dare
they knew the risks when they signed on i have come too far to turn back now
then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny
this ice will break yet  how is our guest
he died raving about phantoms he was mad poor devil  gather a detail have the body removed from my cabin
aye captain
i am convinced not by treating symptoms but by diving nature's most jealouslyguarded secrets
do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes
no but someday
thank goodness we would be out of work
very well then
as a march hare
of course i am it pays to humor the insane
victor victor frankenstein
i know you have a way of making an impression
come now magnus agrippa next thing you know you will be teaching toadstools to speak
can you think of a better reason
quite a few
do me a favor then  keep them to yourself
you are a comfort to me henry
what now writing about it in your journal will not help
it is a letter to my father
somebody has to
nothing in moderation clerval
he was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance
they will hang him all the same
good i will be there to hear his worthless neck snap
it was wrong henry it should not have happened the bastard deserves to die
why waldman he of all people should have cheated death
you cannot death is god's will
i resent god's monopoly
that is blasphemy
blasphemy be damned waldman spent his life trying to help people
all the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor
no he had more important work
there are sick people who need our help here and now not in some future time consider that
i have been preoccupied
how much longer
few months perhaps i am gathering the raw materials even now
we catch a few hours sleep where we can usually here at your bedside
everything in moderation clerval
nothing in moderation frankenstein
victor this place looked like a charnel house what went on here
thank you henry
for what
this my home my family  if not for you i would be dead in a burial pit somewhere
i did not find what i was looking for
yes do not worry i will look after your father you look after her
i owe you that done
let it go
is it also not true that you murdered his brother william in a misdirected crime of passion
what is your name
victor frankenstein sir  of geneva
of geneva  tell me mr frankenstein of geneva do you wish to study medicine or mysticism
despite the lack of challenge
victor explain yourself
krempe has a way of provoking my temper
you have a way of provoking his  i have been watching you you seem impatient with your studies
no i embrace it as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known
nonsense tonight you will draft an apology to professor krempe
numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system
the strain was evident
i am dying
are you a physician
how is it you come to be here
wouldbe i am plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment
i heard
i cannot say i blame them we are trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of creature
creature a human like creature
you know of it
your men are right to be afraid
then explain it whatever it is it could save the voyage i have spent years planning this my entire fortune
you would persist at the cost of your own life the lives of your crew
lives are ephemeral the knowledge we gain the achievements we leave behind those live on
my name is frankenstein
i dunno boy
a bitch
did not recognize you
we have never met
i wonder who will recognize us first they will wet their pants
i hope the men do  i would rather the women did not
i am gonna wet my pants
home is important to a man
you know what gets me
i suppose
must have changed that law
oh shit
at least we found the diamonds
at least
i would really feel stupid if we did not bring anything back home
it is enough that you have brought yourself home
i wish you would tell alice that  and that goddamn mrs wheeler
tell them yourself
you do not know my motherinlaw boy
after eight years in the jungle with you i know mrs wheeler better than i know anybody in the universe
i did not tell you everything
the time we were in a tree for fourteen days you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs wheeler
you are lucky boy  my house is gonna be filled with people
go home
thank god we found the fucking diamonds
the hell with the diamonds
you were rich before  this is the first time i was ever rich
go home  show them how rich you are for a change
can i have the cadillac
take the cadillac and drive it off a cliff for all i care
what will you do for transportation
i will buy a hundred more cadillacs go home
you know what gets me about that cadillac
go home
i am liable to find anything
that is the point  walk in there and find whatever there is to findbefore alice can cover it up
you know what gets me
let's talk about it some other time
how short the skirts are
good night colonel  it is been beautiful
something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone
go home
you ever own a motorcycle
let's talk about something else
i sure did not expect her to drop dead
first nagasakinow this
how about breakfast wife
the educational process
i guess  you are lucky you do not have any old people around here
she was about to get married again she locked me out of the bedroom last night
you know me boy
one of them is the doctor whose weapons are compassion unselfishness peacefulness maudlin concern
you told me
oh  i would forgotten
fourteen times you told me  i counted
of course  not only go to it but go to it in full uniform  rent a uniform
that is against the law is not it i cannot wear a uniform anymore
wear your uniform and every decoration and let them despise you if they dare
alice would be absolutely tearass
the world is teeming with women ours to enjoy
every time i start thinking like that i get the clap
it helped more than you know  down deep people were deeply affected
you keep on saying deep and deeply i wish something good would happen on the surface sometime
he is a man  tell him you are a man
i dunno
you are so low  look at that beautiful red meat  you have not touched it
i dunno you know  i used to really love that alice do you know that
you know her for what she is now garbage
i dunno
shut up you ninny  you were never to come here again for any reason whatsoever
that is this
i would not want to be married to me we are too crazy  you know
in what way pray tell
i did not like that violin thing that was sad
tit for tatas simple as that
you never played a violin
you did
you are an imbecile
i know you think that
everybody thinks that
anybody who would drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb
the one direct decisive intelligent act of your life
i do not think so  it could have been
if what
is penelope in
the posies are for her
i wanted to apologize
you have come to the right man
i forgot my vacuum cleaner
i forget mine for years on end
oh my god  and you are looseleaf harper
our pleasure
eight years you guys were together through thick and thin
i would rather go to viet nam
would somebody please pass me the catsup
what you say is pass the fucking catsup
pass the fucking catsup
get used to it  back door paul
i have considered that
selling vacuum cleaners is not the best preparation you could have
i just want one true adventure before i die
that can be arranged
you are making a joke
i am interested in longterm expectations
it is engineered to last about fifteen years
things  ohyou silly people and your things  things things things
never mind the condition of your body and your spirit  look after your things your things
for what
for africa
do you really think that harold ryan would go to africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman
you invited me
to make an ass of yourself
what went wrong
it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us
i would not drop my gun
you are hollow like a woman
i am smarter than looseleaf
look how you are acting now  this is a moment of truth and you are almost crying  slug me
you are my buddy
out  out
no matter what you say to me i still think you are the greatest guy i ever knew
thank god
as a matter of fact
are youdo you
ask it
do you know who wanda june is
life has denied me that thrill
do you mind if i ask who you are
dr woodly  i should make a little list
is anybody besides you here now
the doctor was called away on an emergency  i think it was birth
where is mom
you do not know where your mother is does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night
she went to the fight with herb shuttle i guess
you think you could find me a pencil and paper
i will see
everybody says he was so brave
even thisherb shuttle you said
he worships father
ah  and what sort of man is this worshiper
he is a vacuum cleaner salesman
it makes life spicy
what does he doof an athletic nature
nothing  he plays a violin in a doctors' quartet
aha  he has a brilliant military record i am sure
he was a stretcherbearer in the korean war  were you in a war with father
big ones little ones teenyweeny onesjust and otherwise
tell me some true stories about dad
dad  dad  the boy wants tales of derringdo name a country
dad was never in england
as in death where is thy sting he killed at least fifty men wounded hundreds more
the sting
i saw your father fight major siegfried von konigswald the beast of yugoslavia hand to hand
tell me that  tell me that
i do not know
the story gets hairier  should i stop
go on
when i grow up i am going to go to mhravitch
it is rather a disappointment these days  it is not there any more
you are supposed to get hurt
they are not engaged
he seems to think they are  he told me that were
oh no no no no no  it cannot be how embarrassing
you are a very good boy to respond that way
no no no no no
i would like to use the sanitary facilities if i may
go ahead  no no no no
is looseleaf harper alive
why do not you go to bedson
i cannot take my eyes off you
tomorrow's another day paul you know what my english literature teacher said about you
cannot it keep till morning
will you go to bed
yes sir  if you cannot wake mom up i have got doubledecker bunks
the smallest thing i have got
can i get dressed first
make it fast
a hundred dollars for breakfast
leave a tip
beat the shit out of someone who hates you
it is mom
gee whiz dad
welcome to manhood you little sparrowfart  load that gun
i do not want to fight you

eighteen  and a half
a springbok an oryx a gemsboka gazelle
i am engaged
daughteri love you very much
you do not even know me
you are woman  i know woman well
this is crazy
destiny often seems that way you are going to marry me
what do you do for a living
the pelt is black  it is a kind of man
how do you do mrs ryan  i would heard you were beautiful and so you are  am i intruding here
not at all
i could not help overhearing that you were about to get married again
give us time
like hugging a lamp post
give us time haroldto adjust to your being alive
you were well adjusted to my being dead
i do not know  this is a new disease to me
a telegrama phone call might have helped
seemed the most honest way to begin life together againnatural unrehearsed
wellenjoy the natural honest unrehearsed resultsurgical shock
you feel that you are behaving as a woman should
every fuse in my nervous system has been blown
we thought a doctor might help
your old beau
we thought it was an emergency
i do not want that chancre mechanic in here
he is a very decent man harold
we all are
should not you lie down
when i am dead  or fucking
paul said you were awfully sick
i was i was  it never lasts long
thank god
have some
say hello to your mother
do say hello to your mother
ghastly cruel unnecessary
you will get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again  you used to eat it up
i did
i had a trip  we will honeymoon here  go out and play
buy yourself breakfast  there we go
it is soso stark
you used to like it stark
justbangwe have a honeymoon
turn around
you should not have talked to norbert that way
ram it up your ass
mrs wheeler is dead
all rightbring me a side order of mrs wheeler  oh hellsit down colonel penelope will bring you some chow
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips
which one
bring me a side order of mrs wheeler
then let me see him go out and get some exercise  right now
we are all going to have to go out for breakfast  the cook quit yesterday
you are a woman are not you
people do not use that word any more
people now have dignity when frying eggs
they do not have to feel like slaves
then go nowand fry with dignity sunnyside up
this is not a coy deception  i do not want to be scrogged  i want love  i want tenderness
you do not know you want  that is the way god built you
i would like to have the expert opinion of the fishalong with yours
fish cannot feel
the whole concept of heroismand its sexual roots
tell me about its sexual roots
i learned a lot of things in college  actuallyit was norbert who told me that
the doctor
his most cherished possession  his violin i guess
and he keeps it in his apartment
i do not think so
that is too bad  i would rather have him at hometo see what i am going to do
what are you going to do
why not
because if you doi will leave you harold  goodbye
sneaking in the back door
i rang  it seemed like the proper door for a servile worthless organism to use
your clothes are at the city dump by now  perhaps you can get a map from the department of sanitation
i came for paul as well
if he wants to go
you took him to the funeral i hear
he would never seen a corpse  he is seen a dozen now
a dozen
it is a big and busy funeral home
did you like it dear
about a broomstick and a cigar boxand the attenuated intestines of an alley cat
two hundred years old
he feels awful losswhich was precisely my intention
he had hoped that someone would be playing it stilltwo hundred years from now
almost a christmas scene
goodbye goodbye goodbye
just one favor
money  there's plenty of that mildred got the brewery  you will probably get the baseball team
i want you to tell me that you loved me once
i see
how unhappy he is going to bealone in his room
he will play with his rifle i expect that will cheer him up
last i heard his mother was going alone
it seems highly intelligent to me
action  interaction  give and take  challenge and response
with an iron penis three feet long load it boy
you are begging him to kill you
if he thinks he is man enough
that is really what you want  you become furious when people will not make you dead
i am teaching my son to be a man
so he can kill you  you hate your own life that much  you beg for a hero to kill you
i plan to live one hundred years
no you do not
if that is the casethat is to prevent my killing myself
honor i suppose
what a handsome word
i do not know  i hope he never hunts  i hope he never kills another human being
you hope this too
do not
ah  the lady is armed
i mean it
then you would better fix your bayonet because there are not any bullets in the gun
where is the bullet
there it is  give it to me
load it for her
the national safety council would be appalled
you have killed women
seventeen of themeleven by accident  march  move  you too
gentlementhat is nice
you startled me
it is always locked
but here you are inside are not you
you areyou are old friends of harold ryan
we tried to be  we tried to be
he is dead you know
dead  such a final word  dead  did you hear that
hello mother
who did she say how far apart the pains were when was that oh dear
oh dear
call her backtell her to head for the hospital  tell the hospital to expect her  i will leave right now
we will miss you so
she is fine  please
and still mrs harold ryan
will you please go  an emergency
she still has just the one child the boy
and what exactly is your relationship to mrs ryan
neighbor  doctor  i live across the hall
and you come into mrs ryangs apartment as often as you please looking into various health matters
yes  please  you have got to get out right now
and her fianc
and her fianc  how nice  i hope you will be very happyor is that what one says to the woman
i have got to run
i have literally got to run
i came back
a policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab
tough luck  you will have to split the fee
areare you crying penelope
she is crying because she is so happy
what next  you leave promptly of course  there is no question as to whose home this is
what a brilliant diagnosis
i know malaria  malaria is not caused by the bites of bats
you have been bitten by bats
chills fevers sweats  you can describe it and name it after yourself the woodly galloping crud
i was going to ask
pacqualinincheewa root
would you say that again
pacqualinincheewa root  means cougar fang cures anything but a yellow streak down the back
i have never heard of it
that is an editorial we of course i have not turned up anything personally
everything about you is the editorial we  take that away from you and you would disappear
you were wrong you quack
what for
quarantine possibly  you may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the american people could do without  goodbye
this little corpse is intended as a lesson
there's a certain amount of information there
lest we forget how cruel you are
it is healer to killer  is that the same thing
what brought you back
the same hairy humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon honor  if you like
you have not heard me yet
oooooo  that hurt
you are oldso old
now who's being cruel
a living fossil  like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs
and terror if you do not mind
i am high as a kite
glands  you are supposed to be happy when you die  call me comical again
you are a clown  you are a clown who killsbut you are a clown
i love you  have a cigar
evolution has made you a clown with a cigar  simple butchers like you are obsolete
i am to be left behindin primordial ooze
if you are at home in the ooze and nowhere else
this is going to become very physical  are you prepared for that
you are not such a creature of the ooze that you would hurt an unarmed man
i am an honorable clown
king arthur
you hope
in any event i will not beg for mercy
no quarter asked  no quarter given
do not you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew
cut me open  find out
i have struck my blow
with spittle
my violin is avenged
something seems to have happened to my selfrespect
and the hell with it  it was so tragically irrelevant so preposterously misinformed
the new hero is you
i hate crowds and i have no charisma
you are too modest
i am utterly satisfied
you are making a mistake  obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded  you have wounded me
more clowning  do not you see
we never quit fighting until we are dead
you would be killing a friend  do not you know how much i like you
i am going to shoot you now
like the sabertoothed tiger
if you want to be found that way
what is this thing that kills me
i have enjoyed being man
get up
thank god harold crawl home
it is trash now like mine
new lives begin
use the sanitary facilities if i may
leave the rifle here
i will put it in paul's room where it belongs
give me your word of honor that that is all you are going to do
for what it is worth now harold ryan the clown gives his sacred word
you do not know
it was a bitch
thank you  you can leave now  we will begin
i dunno  yeah  yeah  yeah  i did
she did
you did not even find that out
there was so much going on
she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum
so that is it kestenbaum kestenbaum everybody was yelling kestenbaum kestenbaum i thought it was some foreign language
no noshit no  excuse me penelope
for what
for saying shit or is that okay now
who's dead
my motherinlaw  fire engines pulmotors doctors cops coroners

i dunno
what will you do colonel
thought you were another wife maybe
i am only ten years old
i heard you were looking for me
you were harold ryangs third wife right
do i have to  who's the little girl
premature ejaculation
is it  i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things
something's made you sore
do not worry about it
you bet i will worry about it  i said something wrong
it is my father's birthdaythat is all  that is all  who cares about that
i had not the slightest inkling  why did not you say so
that is this
do not
you sure misunderstood something and we would better get it straight
explain it to them  i am bugging out of here

you figure
then i saw this bakery store that was still open so i bought a birthday cake
a what
for harold  when paul comes home we can have some birthday cake

what do you need
i need to take back that is mine
 two million people lost in the digital night  what do they seek
yes i believe he has 
 you have made your point  you have got control of the system
 but do not you remember  i am already dead
no she said she had a son  in a dream she once called life
because i took it out of your memory
if you could meet god what would you say to him
there you are sitting next to the creator what do you say

 if your life's so good up there gena what are you doing down here
i am serious how did you know my name
about what
someone who believes in miracles
that is the grace of this world  nothing's impossible
nothing go back to sleep
wake up
from the dream
true  but why
not my problem
so wrong 
in here i am
in a computer program
the new world
it is not real
not real
yes but only in the dream they call life
 but you will never be able to get it through the maze
me  of course not  that is why you are here
 two million people pluggedin here
only up there in the dream they called life
and down here 
yes so which one of us does that make the coward
unfinished business
and what about the reconfiguration
perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth
it is his nature
but what if he does not 
 he will
we are going to have to reconfigure
how long
at least a day
have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers  but remember it is a capacity problem  that is all
 he says the maze has been changed i need to know for sure
new york
i am south dakota
there is no 
take care  where the hell are you going 
of course the legend would like to think that  but no one has keys  your maze was run
but have them wait for me untill they move in on him
sorry i just design the maze  keeping the keys secure is your job
 he will not
he is not pluggedinto the system he is in the fucking system
christoph had spinal cancer  his body kept rejecting gene therapy he was desperate  it was him it was not us 
 i saw the program

 christoph changed the maze
the terrace  first building christoph ever programmed for us

good question
listen to yourself  digitization  you know that officially that is a pure fantasy

come on tanner think this through
cleaning up a mess
some things never change do they
 you told me
what are you talking about
who are you

once they digitized you they added it
for what
i know
but you were with me
not you  a copy
that is the difference
look i am doing mute untill i have a mouthpiece here who's on my side
you do not need a lawyer  we found the program on your laptop

what do you wear in the morning
when you get up you put on a negligee and then you change to a morning frock
you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day
well sometimes they are not completely covered but they do not freeze
they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft something you do not even see

for ourselves we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters
and they might believe her in moscow
what do you mean they might  they will
leon how would you like to have three lifelong friends
that is right and we might as well face it
and that is something we owe to ninotchka
how many families live here with you

let's forget the future let's stop being sentimental let's start that omelet
no no

i am sorry sir but i must insist
here's my passport please give me a visa i have to leave for russia immediately
count leon d'algout a count a nobleman
do not hold that against me please
why should an aristocrat want to go to russia

you believe in our cause
the grand duchess swana active in the white russian movement
believe me i have no connection with her any longer i swear i have not
but you had
listen i want to be absolutely frank with you i have no business in moscow
i think so too
i must get into that country of yours
oh no no visa

you are going to force us huh
on what
how do i know you do not want to blow up a factory
what for why
or a tunnel or a bridge
well  until the policeman whistles again
at what intervals does he whistle
that is funny it is interesting i never gave it a thought before
have you never been caught in a similar situation
you are welcome
you might hold this for me
love to
correct me if i am wrong we are facing north are not we
facing north i would hate to commit myself without my compass pardon me are you an explorer
no i am looking for the eiffel tower
is that thing lost again listen if you are interested in a view
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint
bad manners to point with your own here the eiffel tower
and where are we
here here we are here you are and here i am feel it
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points must you flirt
i do not have to but i find it natural
suppress it
i will try
madame it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is
you are very sure of yourself are not you
nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence
your type will soon be extinct
go ahead
yes very strange
and thank you for getting me up here i have never seen this before beautiful is not it
yes it is
i am glad i saw it before becoming extinct
please do not misunderstand me
then you do not want me to go there
now i did not say that either naturally nothing would please me more
then why do not we go  you might be an interesting subject of study
i will do my best
he takes good care of that
he looks sad do you whip him
no though the mere thought makes my mouth water
the day will come when you will be free go to bed little father we want to be alone
thank you i have had all the calories necessary for today
keeping my body fit keeping my mind alert keeping my landlord appeased that is a fulltime job
and what do you do for mankind
for mankind not a thing  for womankind the record is not quite so bleak
you are something we do not have in russia
thank you thank you
that is why i believe in the future of my country
ninotchka do you like me just a little bit
your general appearance is not distasteful
thank you
look at me the whites of your eyes are clear your cornea is excellent
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you
you do not have to do a thing chemically we are already quite sympathetic
you are the most improbable creature i have ever met in my life ninotchka ninotchka
you repeat yourself
i would like to say it a thousand times
do not do it please
i was wounded before warsaw
wounded how
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade would you like to see my wound
i would love to  tsk tsk tsk
a polish lancer i was sixteen
poor ninotchka poor poor ninotchka
do not pity me pity the polish lancer after all i am alive
just what you see a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution
it is twelve o'clock
it is false sentimentality
no that was restful again
oh my barbaric ninotchka my impossible unromantic statistical
the telephone is ringing
oh let it ring
but one of your friends may be in need of you you must answer
ninotchka or shall i say special envoy yakushova
let's forget that we ever met
tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves
it is out of the question if you wish to approach me
you know i want to
then do it through my lawyer
i kissed the polish lancer too before he died
i did not follow you
then how did you get here
i always eat here
this is a place for workmen
what are you after
must one always be after something
your tactics are useless my name is neither buljanoff iranoff nor kopalski
at what
then you should go back to your table
no i cannot leave you i will not not yet not until i have made you laugh at least once
well er let's drop it i do not think you would care for that one
probably not
do you like scotch stories
i have never heard one
maybe you have not any sense of humor well i will give you one more chance now listen
for twelve francs seventyfive
twelve seventyfive from the clarence the sonofagun made a detour  but he got you here
that is when one half of paris says to the other half what are your plans for this evening madame
well first i should like to take off my hat and jacket  then could we have some music
a wonderful idea radio or records
not radio let's have music that is just for ourselves
anything ninotchka
if you do not want to answer you need not but if you do you must tell me the truth
i promise i swear
did you make any change in this room
i do not think so
i suppose she is very entertaining it must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous
ninotchka you are jealous
and general savitzky
a funny story
you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names
well there were two scotchmen one was named mcintosh and one was named mcgillicuddy they met on the street
you must darling
to the loveliest story i ever heard

good morning swana
do not you find that restful why did not you come last night
darling i was busy looking out for your interests
did you win
we can be rich if you say the word i had dinner with the guizots last night
those newspaper people
you would be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press
sweetheart we will not have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past
now swana
first tell me are you my little volga boatman
yes i am your little volga boatman
a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle tom's cabin
darling this would be wonderful just once were not you attacked by a bolshevik
was i no not by a bolshevik
too bad brings our price down ten thousand francs
oh yes
tell him i will not be able to see him for a half an hour
rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news
that would not have done any good not with her  she is the most incredible creature i have ever seen
you just told me you had not seen her
well er i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby
that bad  old or young
darling if we are going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open 
now darling soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you
is this your new dress suit
yes swana

it is a dream of beauty he never takes my word for anything but i was right was not i
yes swana
am i interrupting
not at all your highness may i present madame yakushova
how do you do
no please
poor madame yakushova here we are talking in mysteries i am sure you wonder what it is all about
no thanks swana
did i act stupidly last night should i apologize
i am the one who should apologize i should have talked to you before
is this by any chance going to be a confession
all right i will listen
i am afraid that is what it is
she is gone leon
do you expect me to believe that
dear me i must be losing my finesse if i am not careful i will be understood by everybody
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude
i just dropped in to have a little hearttoheart talk with you
we have nothing to discuss
i must ask you to leave
i must insist that you leave
not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow
in that case i can only say goodby
i told you to go madame
will not it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them
what do you want
may i have your bags madame
that is no business that is a social injustice
that depends on the tip
good morning comrade commissar here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months
does this include the products of the far eastern provinces
yes it does
you mean you have finished the whole investigation
may i ask why
please sit down
well comrade have you heard from your friends kopalski buljanoff and iranoff
yes leaving immediately
i am sorry i do not want to overstep my position  but please do not send me
i do not understand
i will do my best
this will do 
oh madame this is a restaurant not a meadow
but madame if you do not think about food what do you think about
the future of the common people
that also is a question of food madame i will bring you a nice little lunch  la pre mathieu 
can you recommend a restaurant
well there's pruniers if you care for seafood if you want to lunch in the bois there's
where do you eat
at pre mathieu's
where is that
it is just a place for workmen
where is it
eight blocks down in the rue de poivrel
how do you do my friend
your highness forgive this intrusion but
what is it rakonin did you lose your job
no madame something of the utmost importance it concerns your jewels
my jewels
they are here your jewels here in paris
alexis do you know what you are saying
thank you so much my friend i will get in touch with you
until he is done
dr argon i demand an explanation
if you think i would ever give you the nanobot after this you are deluding yourself
you do not have to give it to us because dr nebbleman can just cut it out of him
come with me susan  i want to show you something
no thank you
you will forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched  poppy
does that mean oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb
do  well i suppose that depends on you
a light mixture of oxygen dioxide and sodium pentothal  he will sleep that is all
you are lacking a few things too ethics morals common decency and oh yeah deodorant
maybe you should but you cannot
ai not it
you mean besides kicking your ass
you think you can use me to stop the meltdown
yeah i am going to finish what you started 
that is right  and making me was the biggest mistake you ever made
you are not rotting meat
icarus please if you want me to give you a bath just say so
no  i am getting used to it
it is ready now i know it is
she says it is not
she is lying  she lost the first one on purpose
she did not  the mouse ran down the drain
she let it escape because she wants me to die
who cares  we have got to find him hurry
now icky i do not need you winding yourself up  i need you focused and in control
but poppy you do not know what this means 
you are right  place a call to our friends at the network and to mr joplin at the epa
dr nebbleman i want to know the moment the nanobot arrives  the instant understand
eventually  these things are always a matter of leverage
and you think o'brien is that leverage
that remains to be seen
based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable
do you think she loves him
she must feel something for him after all she and i did create him
no icky this is real
icarus please  this is important
then you still love me
poppy please just tell me what you want
oh yes icky  i can feel it
this is what my entire life has been directed at this moment this threshold
okay arms up lean forward
i am so excited icarus
considering what
what i asked you earlier
if you loved me like i loved you
poppy this is not the time
did i  i have been waiting for that for years
not that
well yes  the replicators are not as active at low temperatures
then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control
that might work
poppy order the trucks from the gary plant  and we are going to need a containment crew
dr nebbleman take care of them
the trunk
excellent  how long until the assembler tank is complete
in the meantime why do not you find something useful for dr bright to do
shut up and do it
thank you sir
wait wait can i at least have his body
donated to science  perfect
yeah i do
you have no idea what this is doing to your body
i like trix
i want trix  mommy
so what  so what  for starters how about littering is a crime
hawhaw  why do not you run off and find a cop and i will wait right here
you better quit pushing me pal
i will do whatever i have to do
a man
yeah  i knew him when i was still in school
what did he want
oh yeah  they were working on molecular assemblers too were not they
they also tried using viral rna as the bonding element
that is right  cdc found out and closed them down
that is the guy
they will in validate the key probably nothing
well you got another problem
the replicators
worse  mrs argon wants to talk to you  she is waiting in the lab
this day just keeps going from bad to worse
you are looking for a urine sample
susan dr argon is giving you an opportunity here
dr argon would say we are all prisoners
no  well not those exact words
nigel cannot you see he is using you
of course he is but at least there is not a security guard outside my door
you are afraid of him
who is not
mr sim watch out  o'brien escaped and could be on his way
smell  uh something like methylcyanoacrylate
like crazy glue
yes  that is it  he is got it  oh god he is got it
so i guess it worked
and if we evacuate what do you want to do with o'brien
been out for six months now
really  what have you been doing
you know this and that
same old daniel
the big house
jesus daniel  it was not ryker's island  it was work camp for white collar criminals
a cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men
i remember you said nanotechnology was going to change the world
it already is
i have read they are using it to repair cancer cells
and for cleaning up oil spills
right  you predicted it
it was a long time ago daniel  we were young different people heading in different directions that is all
sure  can i ask you one more thing you have not published anything in a while  how come
that is what i thought
we will see  what does that mean
we will see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making agent orange
god daniel i am not going to make agent orange
am i  look  right there  that is exactly what i am talking about
susan this is the future of america here
daniel what are you doing here
please susan  i need help something is wrong with me
sorry daniel i am a physicist not a psychiatrist
no something is really wrong look
the nanobot
mouse  what mouse
my first organicpolymerization was a lab mouse
what happened to it
i do not know
it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment
but you have polymerized singlecelled bacteria and the fruit flies i know you have
we do not
mostly caffeine diuretics  help you go to the bathroom
if you do not want to do it this way i can remove it surgically
the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste
what waste
the problem is the byproduct created by the process
the waste
what happens
three days ago it was
what do these replicators do to people
with enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else
that is right
is not it already too late then
you are the doctor
no why
no no i just feel wired
what about it
the polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl cyanoacrylate  so that is wrong
just giving credit where credit is due
you have no one to blame but yourself
blame the victim
you are not protecting the world you are obstructing progress
i do not consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress
and i am sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world
but lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate
come on i do not see you living in a cave
and i do not see you sunbathing at chernobyl
yeah  old times
i am glad you came to me for help
probably the caffeine
do you have something to bring me down
no problem
daniel i did not hear you come down
the nanobot it is not here
it is still inside me
i do not know
something else i want to try
i was hoping you were over that remember to keep drinking fluids
getting used to it
like a glove
on the counter
the head shrinker at the prison
you did not think i could just leave you
where is it
argongs private lab
let's go
i am not leaving without you susan
did you think i could just leave you
oh shit the meltdown  it is spread to the tower
we have got to get the nanobot
it is too late  argon injected it
you mean he is polymerized like me
the same thing i suppose
we do not have time to argue susan
i have to
do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you  how about 'infantile dementia'
god what a fight that was
we were different people then
i guess they do
i am real touched  now get your sunday's on  we are going for a ride
oh yes you are
forget it pissboy  you tell argon he can call my lawyer
you were looking for us
yeah i have something i have been meaning to give you
yeah and what might that be
an assbeating  would you like yours first mr sim
oh yeah
the question is are you
it is a miracle
mr sim  do you have him  he is alive
oh yeah he is alive  technically
and you have him
we lost him
i am aware of dr argongs frustrations
he believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now
look as i have said and will continue to say the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority 
you will not  that is why you are whispering
do not worry four eyes
'paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured'
pipe down brain lady  and you
actuallyi am not real  hungry
oh nonsense young lady you are going to start your day with a nice big breakfast
what do you mean

my name's david
but you do not know how long i have been looking for someone like you
i do not think we should discuss this until i am a little bit more composed
wait a minute
maybe in a day or so when i am not so emotional 
come back
oh i know they are not but i mean they are just cookies after all 
excuse me
what do i mean  you think this is a toy you think it is your own little goddamn coloring book 
lookit just sort of happened

excuse me
i am sorry  i cannot let you do that
just gimme the goddamn remote
i am actually  glad to see you have finally shown your true colors
why do not you just take me back without it
i am sorry i cannot do that
i do not know  three four weeks
much less than that  an hour and a half
this is tv pal they do not fool around
oh sure for the first hundred years then it starts to get a little monotonous  sleep well
i understand
listen to me
hi there you took off so quick i was not sure if you were okay
oh yeah sorry i am fine i just  had to get home early
there are not any cheeseburgers
look i thought we talked about this i thought we said 
ohthat is the point bud
what are you talking about you make hamburgers that is the point
 like the other night when i closed up by myself that was different 
forget about that
oh  okay   but i really liked it
 that is that
i think you should try not to think about this anymore
i brought you something  from the library
oh my gosh bud 
open it
i will never be able to do that
oh wellyou are just starting out i mean you cannot do it 
no that is not it
you are gonna keep painting are not you
just a littleyou know
tv repair
yeah tv busted
that is the rush
that is not the reason i have got a date at six thirty
heywho did muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him
what happened
a miracle
this is not funny i happen to have a very important date in like five minutes
well you do not have to worry about that anymore
you knowthis is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation
yeah  saw you too
i am pleased to have the new post sir
it is remarkable doctor the patients are so subdued so docile
they have the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide
my years tending the lepers at st emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings doctor
we have still a few lone incurables prone to violence to perversion
no one's forcing you to listen
once or twice
i hear he is got a whetstone and chisel and he uses them to sharpen his teeth
he is a writer not a madman
then that is he doing here
i think she is sweet on him that is what i think
for fuck's sake who else would it be the witching hour's arrived you have alerted the others yes
i am no longer a man i awoke to discover i would turned into a sparrow
now give the signal
with that fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue 
a poker he took a poker from the fire
we cannot all we can do is guard against our own corruption
the next time you feel the urge to visit the marquis i hope you will come to confession instead
his stinking breath caused my eyes to run that is all
not now or we are both done for
do not say that reading's my salvation
but why must you indulge in his pornography
i put myself in his stories i play the parts each strumpet each murderess
why not act the role of heroines instead queen esther from the bible or st joan
he is not the man who's cast a shadow here
i have you to look after me have not i
turn you out
by whom the marquis
mother's not half so blind as you
why not
they incite us to act in ways we should not cannot a lesson the marquis would do well to learn
what what have i done
do not come back not tonight not again 
you will hate me now will not you
do not come any closer abbe god's watching
must not do that sir
i must grant him his last rites
i do not take my orders from you not anymore
you would deny a dying man his salvation
it is not even noon 
conversation like certain portions of the anatomy always runs more smoothly when it is lubricated
i am not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption
do not be so sure
what did you do bribe one of the guards
but you implored me to write for curative purposes to stave off my madness 
but you have no right to publish behind my back without my sanction
have you truly read the book in question or did you run  straightaway  to the dogeared pages
enough to discern its tenor
and such puny scope nothing but the very worst in mangs nature
but is not that the duty of art to elevate us above the beast
i thought that was your duty abbe not mine
one more trick like this and i will be forced to revoke all your liberties
it is that doctor fellow is not it he is come to usurp your place here has not he
more than your writing's at stake the ministry has threatened us with closure
they cannot be serious
our future lies in the stroke of your pen
mightier than the sword indeed
you among them
do i have your word
do not be absurd it is only a play
how can one man possibly be so selfish
we held a mirror up to the doctor and  apparently  he did not like what he saw
if you will not be true to your word then you have left me no choice
whores and pederasts you are better off without them
you always do
madeleine she is besotted with me she would do anything i ask she could pay you a midnight visit 
i do not know who you insult more her or me
part the gates of heaven as it were 
that is enough
you are tense darling you could use a long slow screw
good day marquis
then bugger me
his rug
and my chaise  am i being denied the privilege of sitting  of plopping down my ass 
valcour his chair
orvolle his wine  from now on nothing but water at every meal 
because your writing continues unchecked
its horrors perhaps its darkest nightmares and to what end nothing but your own morbid gratification 
a man after my own heart
what in god's name am i to do with you the more i forbid the more you are provoked
i could be convinced to abandon my writing quite voluntarily
what on earth would that require
a night spent with the partner of my choice
you expect me to pimp madeleine
i was not talking about madeleine
coulmier you animal
i do not mean to flirt marquis
oh but you must my pumpkin sex without flirtation is merely rape
now strip
your wig remove your wig
your words drove bouchon to 
so many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work i am blessed am i not
oh that is rich  coming from her lapdog 
i saw the longing in your eye 
 that was lust 
 the passion in your heart 
i know because i felt it myself 
i wanted to fuck her that is all
and did you
it is not your province to ask
you are no stranger to rape marquis and yet with her you cooed you courted you begged
go to hell
why was it you never took her by force
who's to say i did not
was it impotence
we inspected the body marquis she died a virgin
tomorrow we will cut out your tongue
i am here
surely you will grant me a final word
of course
it is a formality truly
if you do not mind my asking why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my our affairs
it seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy
a few indiscretions in his youth
his wife's influence
his wife's
better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one
a man of his notoriety he would not last a day on the streets without capture
he no longer roars or spits he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards 
and his writing
do you favor its publication
for sale to the general public certainly not it is unprintable
all france is aghast at this book yet you have not heard of it
i have taken vows to live my life within these walls not outside them
in their eyes the marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here
but he is one among some two hundred wards 
have you tried bleeding him with leeches the calming chair maybe you should flog him at the stake
why so he will learn to fear punishment rather than pursue virtue for its own reward
you are a sentimental man
and place my reputation at stake
charenton is my life's work to have her wrested from beneath me now 
you keep strange company abbe but if you truly have matters in hand here 
i have
 then i have friends of my own to visit
oh indeed
of course
it was not inspired by circumstance
no it most certainly was not
that is not our intent 
do more otherwise i will be forced to report to the ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum
what could cause a tincture like this
it is a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children 
this child let loose the beast from its cage 
madeleine's not wicked it is the marquis who's corrupted her that is not her fault it is mine
you would suffer in her stead
he was so impressed with the marquis' tale that he chose to reenact it yes
i beg you doctor do not make me say it
her name abbe
and my own
how is the patient faring
no sir plainly put i never expect to sleep again
of course your highness nevertheless cure the marquis de sade succeed where countless physicians and priests have failed
i am afraid so he is an idealist you will have to be politic
do you know how i define idealism monsieur delben
i will pay you another visit with a share of the profits once its sold
i will be waiting
maybe someday you will tell me your name
sweet then like the pastry
stop i beg you have pity i say you are not my lover you are a monstrous rou
was ever a man more risqu he wants to take me every way
i tremble with fear you are bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound
and then  to prove your truly mine  i will plunder you darling from behind
what of my lips will you soil them too when you have broken every other taboo
i will fill every slippery hollow if you are obliging then you will swallow
come now darling give it a read
oh it is terrible it is too too terrible  well go on
now's not the time to be cheeky maddy
it is because of the marquis is not it
do not start 
go ahead you have a key slip it through my tiny hole
i suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours
i put myself at life and limb surely that is worth a few louis
there's something else i want from you
you have already stolen my heart as well as another more prominent organ south of the equator
your publisher says i am not to leave without a new manuscript
i have just the story inspired by these very surroundings
is it awfully violent
most assuredly
is it terribly erotic
fiendishly so
must i administer them directly or might i blow them
the price my coquette is every bit as firm as i am
oh you you talk same as you write
the climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap
you demand a lot from your readers you do
that is that then
they decreed me a savage and now they have made me one
it is only been described to me in your books
you are far crueler than i my sweet
first and foremost he is a man you remind him of that fact and he resents you for it
how do you propose i write it with dust upon the air
you could whisper it through the walls of your cell
go on child
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined
something to make the angels weep and the saints to gasp for air
what shall i ready asked fanchon my mouth my ass or my succulent oyster
tell him i am no fool a prisongs still a prison even with chinese silk and chandeliers
by the time you read this we will be long gone bound for england or points beyond
no but tell him i would
desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy
my schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics
i pray you be succinct
you are new to charenton yes perhaps you are not yet familiar with my husband and his unusual case
i pay his stipend every month far more dutifully than i should
i am not a wealthy woman
but you have a pension have not you from the sale of his books
it is tainted money doctor
what a beautiful thought marquise
what thought is that
that illgotten funds borne of his degeneracy might now effect his salvation
oh but i am
 words alone are insufficient
it is beyond perversity that honor should carry a price tag
now is the time to secure your epitaph the benevolent marquise charentongs most revered philanthropist or satangs bride
and i in yours
doctor can i impart to you his cruelest trick
of course
once long ago in the folly of youth he made me love him
it is libelous you would not dare
shame on you truly
how was i to tell you by writing a letter with what my asinine bride
you have come to lecture me
to flaunt your deviance in public upon a stage
they have put you up to this have not they
you ought to court the doctor's favor not his contempt
give me back my anonymity that is all i ask let me be invisible again
but it is just begun 
do as i say
very much
i would prefer to have our brandy in the salon there we can sit sideby side before the fire
i would rather read thankyou
you prefer a book to your husband's company
no when i was but a tender lad
last week would this be
not you too

orson  we cannot get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot
we done
i am christ
you want to do the life of jesus
false alarm
oh well please sit down
oh no problem it can wait
are you uncomfortable with my appearance
no i think you look fine
oh well maybe i am uncomfortable with my appearance i feel a little out of place in these surroundings
what about it do you like i am not being critical i would really like to know
yes so you feel security stability like things are going to last awhile
oh definitely i mean just this past year has gone by like phew i hardly even knew it passed
anyway i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned
you mean like time flies
nine years
nine years
yes i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place
why did not you know him well
i knew him very well we were extremely close until i dropped out
i would imagine that we are now i think i am ready to use the bathroom finally
thank you
sister older or younger
who's elizabeth
how do you mean
hmm well maybe you are really i would not pay much attention
kids what about them
do you want them
yeah actually i do but john does not at least not right now
why is that
i do not know he just said he wants to wait i quit asking
do you want me to
you are in therapy
are not you
you had sex with you therapist
of course not
oh see i meant someone you have had sex with that is part of the theory
excuse me for asking but how would you know
well i was not always impotent
basically yes
that is correct  bit of a dilemma is not it
are you in the middle of something
nothing i cannot finish later
i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished
not much to see i am afraid i am sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe
what kind of personal project
oh just a personal project like anyone else's personal project mine's just a little more personal
who's donna
donna was a girl i knew in florida
you went out with her
not really
all of these are interviews
because i promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me
the interviews are about sex ann
about sex
everything about sex
like what
mostly sometimes they do things
to you
no not to me for me for the camera
i do not why why do you do this
i am sorry this came up
this is just so
maybe you want to go
yes i do
i know
you know
she said it on her tape
why did not you tell me
ann when would i have told you we were not speaking if you recall
why not
do not you want to make one
yes but i sense the element of revenge here
what difference does it make why i do it
that is a good question
what do you have to do to get ready
load a new tape turn the camera on
then do it
i have money
what will you do when the money runs out
it will not are you ready
ann bishop millaney
ann bishop millaney
you are married correct
when we are making love
does he go down on you
it is a simple question have you ever thought of having  making love with someone other than your husband
absolutely not
then as far as this taping goes you have nothing to worry about
i guess not
do you want me to stop
i know deep down i know that it just bothers me when i have feelings or impulses that she has
i fantasized about you
about me
i thought i made that clear before when i said i would go down on you
i remember you could do that could not you go down on me
if i cannot do it all i do not want to do anything and i cannot do it all
cannot or will not
that is correct
so you have had sex
her name was elizabeth
so what happened was it so bad that it turned you off
no it was wonderful that was not the problem
what was the problem
yes i did willfully and repeatedly
how come
now i make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me
do not you get lonely
did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him
not yet i am not sure i will i just want out
if you do get out of your marriage will you continue to be inhibited
i am babbling
no you are not
god i m so mad at him
you should be he lied to you so did cynthia
i am not planning on it
i am not in love with you
but if you were
i i cannot answer that precisely
but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you
that is very flattering
so why will not you make love with me why would not you i mean
ann are you asking me hypothetically or are you asking me for real right now
i am asking for real i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me will you
why not
i have told you
but i do not understand 
ann it could happen to me all over again do not you see i could start to 
but how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig 
i could not face her if i had slept with somebody else
i do not know possibly
but that was part of it
i do not know
oh you just moved here to think about it right
why not
i am just going to keep asking until you answer i am sure there's plenty of tape
i do not find this turning the tables thing very interesting 
i do not care
well what kind of answer are you looking for ann what is it exactly that you want to know
i want to know why you are the way you are
did you see a message to call me when you got back in
that is interesting because i did not leave a message
who would you have lunch with
i ate by myself
are you having an affair
jesus christ where would that come from i have a late lunch by myself and now i am fucking somebody
well are you
no i am not frankly i am offended at the accusation
i cannot tell you how upset i would be if you were lying
for god's sake ann i am not fucking your sister i do not find her that attractive for one
is that supposed to comfort me
i am not either
why do not i believe you
i did not say it was rational i just said i was convinced
is not therapy helping at all
i do not know sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world
quitting your therapy will not feed the children of ethiopia
i know
i drove around then i went to talk with graham
no but i wanted to i really wanted to partially just to piss you off
not very often
you bitch i knew it
what do you mean
yeah i know
this unexpected visit notwithstanding how are things with john
fine i guess except right now i am going through this where i do not want him to touch me
did you masturbate
god no
i take it you have never masturbated
well kind of recently i guess but not too recently
well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you  i knew i should not have watered those plants
did you confront john about the visitor
what visitor
the friend of johngs that was staying at your house
no he left last week
did you find him attractive
what do you mean like physically
let me rephrase were you attracted to him
you understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time
not really
do you feel there is more progress to be made
but you do not have hidden motives for feeling that way right
i know but this i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex
why so you can go after him
jesus ann get a life i just asked what he looked like
do you have to say that
i say it because it is descriptive
well i wonder why
my type what is this bullshit how would you know what my type is
i have a pretty good idea
well i will call him when he does
but he will not
what are you talking about
he is not getting a phone he does not like talking on the phone
oh please okay so give me the zen master's address i will think of a reason to stop by
let me talk to him first
why just give me the address you will not even have to be involved
i do not feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and
and what
and do whatever it is you do
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune
are you getting mom something for her birthday
i do not know i will get her a card or something
a card for her fiftieth birthday
that is wrong with that
i just thought it might 
okay ann okay how about this you buy her something nice and i will pay for half all right
i was thinking maybe i should not be in therapy anymore
what do you mean he does not want me to come over did you tell him about me
no i did not
why not
because i never got around to it
well why
because cynthia look john was right graham is strange very strange you do not want to get involved with him
what the hell happened over there did he make a pass at you
no it is nothing like that
well what is he dangerous
no he is not dangerous not physically
well what then
i do not want to talk about it
then why would you call me
i do not know
what kinds of questions
questions about sex
well like what did he ask exactly
because i wanted to
but why did you want to
i wanted him to see me
you do not know that for sure
well it is too late now is not it
did he touch you
no but i did
you touched him
you are in trouble
listen to you you sound like mom what are you talking about
i cannot believe you did that
you could not do it period
you know what i mean you do not even know him
i feel like i do
that does not mean you do you cannot possibly trust him he is perverted
he is harmless he just sits around and looks at these tapes that is the big deal
so he is got this catalogue of women touching themselves that does not make you feel weird
no i do not think they all did what i did
you are in serious trouble
then why do you keep asking about it
what is it
it is a sun dress
it looks like a tablecloth
it does not
hold on
thirtytwo dollars
well i cannot stay
did you take your clothes off
wait a minute do you mean do not tell me you in front of him
there's a phone here
it was busy
so will you someday
i am cynthia bishop
do i know you
i am ann millaney's sister
the extrovert
she must have been in a good mood when she said that she usually calls me loud
she called you that too may i ask why you are here
you want me to leave
i just want to know why you are here
well like i said ann is my sister sisters talk you can imagine the rest
and are you here to berate me for making her that way
i uh know a guy at the power company
what do you get
well either you are or you are not which is it
why do not you let me tape you
doing what
sex your sexual history your sexual preferences
what makes you think i would discuss that with you
i just want to ask you questions
and that is all
that is all
is this how you get off or something taping women talking about their sexual experiences
absolutely not they are for my private use only
how do we start
i turn on the camera you start talking
and you ask questions right
that depends on you one woman only used three minutes another filled up three two hour tapes
can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what 
whichever you prefer
i would rather sit are you ready
just a moment
cynthia patrice bishop
describe for me your first sexual experience
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse
your first sexual experience
when i was fourteen
live or in a photograph or film of some sort
very much live
what did you think did it look like you expected
no if anything after i looked at it awhile it got more interesting it had character you know
he said that my hand felt good
then what happened
then i started moving my hand and then he stopped talking
if you wish  you are not wearing any underwear
do you like the way i look
is that what he tells you
he does not have to tell me
i never do more than one i am sorry
i cannot talk you into it
no you will have to get somebody else
now who the hell is going to do that for me
i am sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer
well what the hell am i supposed to do
cynthia i do not know
i cannot believe you are doing this after i let you tape me
i am sorry i cannot do it
goddamit give me my tape then
i only get one today gee how exciting
i did
could be risky
well maybe i could just start a rumor then
no i mean doing it at my house
afraid of getting caught
you are intrigued
you are scum i will be there
not today i have got other plans
oh  well when then
how about inviting me over to dinner
you know what i mean
yeah i know what you mean
i want to see you
well this is timely your wife is here would you like to speak to her
she is there that is she doing there
nothing wrong with trying
i do not think my sister would agree
look i will call you okay
that is so stupid about it
that you you do not even know the guy
well you know him he is a friend of yours do you think he can be trusted
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands
interact fine but did you have to masturbate in front of him for god's sake i mean
you told ann about this
of course she is my sister i tell her almost everything
i wish you had not done that
why not
it is just something i would prefer she did not know about
she is a grownup she can handle it
i just ann is very
hung up
it will not i trust him
you trust him
yeah i do a helluva lot more than i trust you
what do you mean
exactly what i said i would trust him before i would trust you how much clearer can i be
it hurts that you would say that to me
actually no i have changed my mind i should not have called
well i am here now i would like to do something
how about straightening up the living room
god you you are mean
i know will you please leave now
maybe i do not want to leave maybe i want to talk
john we have nothing to talk about
i knew it i knew it things are getting complicated
no john things are getting real simple
it will just be me
plus first and last month deposit

how about for five hundred
what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit you are wearing
a bonfire probably
you were prying before
yes this afternoon i was grilling ann about your marriage this afternoon
really how would it go
she held up very well
what do you mean
i like having the car the car is important
especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry
or go someplace in a hurry
where are the tapes graham
what tapes
you know which tapes where are they
john as a lawyer you should know that those tapes are private property
so is my wife asshole
she is not property john she is a person were you just going to keep right on lying to her

as janet's parents this should be really easy  your last clue mental instability  you have thirty seconds
i got it  i got it
congratulations  it is 'happy homes' for harry and emily weiss of denton
you got it
i got it  i got it
i am janet majors and this is my husband brad
he needs help
looks like  arest home' for this marriage
i have caught it once or twice
it is no use pussyfooting around janet  we have to cut quick and deep
on the contrary  he wants to see your ratings soar  he needs a woman of exceptional desirability
after breakfast  you are sounding tense janet  maybe i could give you a little massage
jah  you endorse his product  he endorses your research
i am in farley's employ  and  we are discussing a network deal
why janet
everyone loves the girl next door particularly farley
so it seems
they probably meant irving and wanted you to swing
who trusts experts
show yourself  the real you the secret you
judge wright  now betty first name terms surely
oh oliver you are so tolerant time for a coffee before you rush off
delighted betty  that is if you do not mind being seen with an older man
why oliver since ralph and i separated maturity is something i look for in a man
everything's free there
is not that brad and janet majors sitting down front  what an ideal couple
it is happened before  remember lieutenant orpheus  he disappeared into that underworld series and never came back
sounds like my husband  he never came back either  at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break
ah yes  farley flavors  you know i find it
overreact  you are the one with theories about conspirac  oliver
yes betty
are you spoken for this evening
it pays to know your way around oliver
oh i adore coleridge taylor  as a matter of fact
yes  macabre is not it  the blind leading the blind
yes betty  but the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset
president  past presidents betty this is beginning to add up
really  what will i pin this on
faith betty  but make sure it is your own
some people do it on the pavement
not at all  you have your life  and i have mine
yeah well  here betty  i just came to give you this
shove it ralph
you too betty
i do not want to get up there
we have got to brad everyone's watching
what are you trying to do  make bert look like a fool  he is made all the arrangements
but i do not need treadment
i am looking for trade
some people do it for the fashion
some people do it to be funny
some people do it for the money
you have lost your cause
you have lost your heart
you have lost your cause
some people do it for for their lovers
some people do it for for improvement
some people do it for movement
some people do it for for enjoyment
some people do it for for employment
tenderness and innocence in denton
he was adopted you know
i would forgotten
wellmaybe i could wear my black leather brogues
too flashythey will clash with the new outfits
sure thing
we have heard rumors that you are going to unveil more than just a new series tonight  is this true
absolutely correct
could you tell us a little about it
let's just say that i am putting sanity back on the national menu
and how does *'local girl'* janet majors fit into the scheme of things
of course
that does not make sense
the question is does brad want to see you  quite frankly he hates you
what do you mean
he is a lame dog remember  but even he would not want to see you like this
oh  mom  it is brad
i know
just what the doctor ordered  i know  come on in my favourite show is just started
what show
thank god he was born an orphan it would have killed his parents
janet  where is that lovely dress i made you
oh mac ran up this little crowdpleaser

there are countless people in this world who believe they are happy
i understand your concern but i feel it is time you started thinking of yourself  look at yourself
absolutely true  compared to all of them you are perfection flawless beauty
if only brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me
you have got a really tight team around you  and everybody needs you
but what will i do  what will i say  what will i wear
of course  he was in great danger of harming himself
i never signed the contract  he is not going anywhere
i cannot wait to begin on him really bert i do not know what we would do without you
i do not think he intends to go that far
what does he know about it
yes how are you janet  are you happy
yes janet  leave the crying to brad
you are no good
you are no good
what a joke
you fel like choking you play for broke
you play for broke
he leaves you smoking
oh romance is not a childrengs game
you keep going back it is driving you insane
in the old series we did not have a convertible
ah macy  why do not you help janet freshen up before rehearsal
and an attractive financial prospect for denton
like a deep plum lipstick and some therapeutics

so you have found thorkel
some of him charbroiled bones teeth we ruled out suicide  any bad blood between him and ock
but you said he went off a little after the accident when those mechanical arms
i know him
it is a lot of ground to cover we will try  funny coincidence huh
no such thing as coincidence  god does not play dice with the universe
einstein right  we will see ya
peter my condolences
any sign of our friend
precise equipment such as waldos
that is the understatement of the year
your records are older than you are  have you never heard of new wave

do ya lemme give you the number for bellevue  that is 5615151
yeah a psychiatric hospital listen i am serious
power down  i need to talk to you
proof  proof of a unified field not just theory and equations experimental proof
let's talk in the hall
i could not care less  what i have done is
doubtless  and you will have all the time in the world to pursue your work   somewhere else
rosomoff i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents
perhaps but every now and then someone pays attention  you did
i heard about thorkel's order
i left a paper in my desk
all right we may be insignificant imperfect creatures but we are all we have got
you are wrong  just for a moment i heard saw felt i became creation
truth pure eternal  beyond the boundaries of mere mortality
i will repeat the experiment  i will hold the truth that is the only thing that matters
no it is not
oh roz  my mind is so far beyond yours now  i could beat you at chess now
you have no right  this is cosmic suicide
hi professor  that is up
an extension on that astronomy paper  because uh
your dog ate it
actually i got this spider bite
pretty lame for such a smart kid
really professor i
caused by doc ock's experiment
how much do you know about it
not a lot  i saw inside of the science center  what exactly happened
only octavius knows for sure  and last time i spoke to him he was on the planet whizbang
no thank you  i am sure you have got your own problems
luck  the right place at the right time
really  i would like to speak with him
i do not think i will be running into him
you never know  go get some sleep
i will try thanks
oh yeah  thanks
if you really apply yourself you will get an a next time
why it is a wrestling match or
letterman show nbc we will talk then  bye
like it
nah  the big mask was better
yup  oh here's your check minus my commission  solid solid novelty act
no  no i my aunt and uncle something's wrong    i need to make a phone call
okay kid call me tomorrow
i just gave yeah sure
explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles
right  let's go
yeah just a lung full of new jersey  lucky you showed up when you did
excuse me if i am impertinent but how did you become whatever it is you are
the usual  heredity and environment  that is the deal with doc ock
he will try to finish his experiment
and blow up the universe just to prove he is right  bit egotistical is not it
just drop me off here
no but i have got this secret identity to worry about i will swing the rest of the way
i am not so happy myself
sure in the war  pull those cables
no no  not there
we will consider it a prisoner exchange
where is he
he is
then when is he going to engineering
full disruptors
thanks for pointing that out
twelve years sir
yes well congratulations ensign it would not be the enterprise without a sulu at the helm
when is it expected back
i wanted to save geordi i tried but i experienced something i did not expect  i believe it was fear
can you project its course
i believe so
veridian iii is uninhabited but veridian iv supports a preindustrial humanoid society
i have to find a way to get to soran
it has occurred to me on several occasions but i believe this may be the appropriate time
wait a minute i thought you have always been afraid it would overload your neural net
really what do you feel
i am uncertain i have had little experience with emotions i am unable to articulate the sensation
you get what
the farpoint mission data that was seven years ago
i know i just got it  it was very funny
it appears to be a magnetically sealed
i am sorry but i cannot stop myself i think something is wrong
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays
we better get you back to the ship  la forge to enterprise
one minute to warp core breach
the station complement was nineteen
i am quitepreoccupied with concern about geordi
we all are data but we are going to get him back
i hope so sir
perhaps  yes if we sent a lowlevel ionic pulse it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems
all hands brace for impact
the ships are bearing at 310 mark 215 distance three light years
on screen
beam them directly to sickbay
i will go you have the bridge
oh yes i remember everyone who was on the lakul every face even the ones who did not make it
that is the nexus
you are in the nexus
for you this is where you wanted to be
but i never had a wife children a home like this
enjoy them jeanluc
where is he now
wherever he wanted to be
why would you want to leave
can i
yes where would you go
i do not understand
i told you time has no meaning here if you leave you can go anywhere any time
you are right i will need help  guinan will you come back with me together we could
i cannot leave i am already there remember
it is our pleasure
please please
oh of course
please i insist
you left spacedock without a tractor beam
risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair
yes yes it is
i am from what you would consider the future the 24thcentury
not exactly as i said this is some kind of
temporal nexus yeah i heard you  something's missing
you are a starfleet officer and you have a duty to
that is right
close to retirement
i had not planned on it
that is right
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim
you could say that
did we do it did we make a difference
yes  thank you
least i could do for a captain of the enterprise
what do you mean you are not going we promised
when i retired i swore i would never set foot on a starship again and i meant it
and what would that be sir
sulu when did he find the time for a family
it is like you always said if something's important enough you make the time
phasing to where
there's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude
i thought you might
an antimatter discharge directly ahead8a it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away
a photon torpedo
where are the deflector relays
i always do
captain i do not know how much longer i can hold her together
normal is what everyone else is and what you are not
what do you want
i was ordered to by the captain
guinan i do not know what you are talking about
when we went to ancient rome for deanna's promotion we threw her to the lions remember
we think they were looking for something they practically tore the place apart
hmm  inform starfleet command this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector
you want me to contact starfleet
is there a problem
no sir
thank you number one
sir is there anything wrong
no thank you
how is that possible
too big how long until the ribbon arrives
you may still somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise
yes fine if you will excuse me
actually i am here to see if there's anything i can do for you
well i appreciate your concern but i would rather not discuss it right now thank you
my brother had shouldered that burden allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs
there's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life your own career
mr data scan the planet for lifeforms
yes yes captain thank you for coming
the thought had crossed my mind
what if i told you i found a new truth
the nexus
time has no meaning there the predator has no teeth
thank you
you see the top yardarm now look to the
there are no other ships in the system
well that narrows it to klingon breen or romulan
aye sir
the star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes
lock phasers and return fire
plasma coilsis there any way we can use that to our advantage
i do not see how the plasma coil is part of their cloaking device
right and they will be vulnerable for at least two seconds  datalock onto that plasma coil
aye sir
it would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix 
it is new  have you any idea what you are saying
but as you are so fond of observing doctor i am not human
you are not going in there  
i am afraid i cannot stop to discuss this logically 
that is all you have to say
i am not a drama critic
they will learn galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young doctor
'beware romulans bearing gifts' happy birthday
i only use it for medicinal purposes do not be a pring
twentytwo eightythree
takes the stuff a while to ferment gimme
more antiques for your collection  cheers
four hundred years old you do not find many with the lens still intact
uh  what are they
for your eyes for most patients of your age i generally administer retlax five to restore flexibility of the lens
but i am allergic to retlax
exactly happy birthday
amazing i do not know what to say 
say thank you
thank you
bones i do not want to be lectured
bull you are hiding  hiding behind the rules and regulations 
and who am i hiding from
from yourself admiral
the inspection will continue once we are underway doctor
as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of reopening old wounds
computer request security procedure and access to project genesis summary
i got beat we are only alive because i knew something about these ships that he did not
he is been there and has not found what he wants can you spare someone there may be people hurt
i can spare me
where utheyu went saavik
then this will be your big chance to get away from it all
how can you think of food at a time like this
our first order of business is survival
it is like the garden of eden
and almost got tossed out of the academy
we each face death every day we are alive saavik
i am taking this bunch to sick bay
young i feel young doctor
commander we are receiving this is regula i go ahead
dr marcus good we are en route to you and should be there in three days
but genesis is a civilian project under my control 
i have my orders
message breaking up carol that is wrong that is wrong
 cannot read you repeat
repeat that is wrong that is wrong
 taking genesis away from us
taking genesis who who is taking genesis
 see you but cannot hear did you order
what order who's taking genesis
 please help us jim will not let them have without proper repeat on whose authority
why why did not you tell me
something spock was trying to tell me on my birthday
and bored i know but maybe it is something they can
par for the course you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner
you do that and you will have murdered your father
i do not understand who's responsible for all this who is khan
this is just to give us something to do is not it  come on
we have picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner
damn are you sure maybe the scanner's out of adjustment 
i suppose it ucouldu be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix
all right let's get on the commpic to doctor marcus maybe it is something we can transplant
you know what she will say
captain this is the garden spot of ceti alpha vi 
i can hardly see 
i saw it  
there's an airlock
that is the matter  
never mind hurry
what do you want with us i demand 
marooned on ceti alpha v he is completely mad admiral he blames you for the death of his wife
umm and would admiral kirk have access to such information
i would think so sir he is on the fleet general staff
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis
to doctor marcus the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i
i see helmsman
you realize sir that they will attempt to contact admiral kirk and confirm the order
uwe were still thereu you dumb bastard we could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room 
i am doctor marcus
she is making it up my father was professor 
we appear to have plenty of time
how soon 
we encoded four minutes 
we will beam aboard and stop it 
you cannot
uh no  i should be on the bridge
are you running away from me
no i  i guess i am not what you expected
i did not expect anything
that makes two of us  lieutenant saavik was right you never have faced death 
but good words that is where ideas begin maybe you should listen to them
i am trying david
so am i my friends were killed too
i am truly sorry
is that what you came here to say
mainly  and also that i am proud  very proud  to be your son
only half of you would get there
the admiral's son
do not you believe it
oh i believe it
i do not know
let them eat static
they are still running with shields down
locking phasers on target
raise them 
uwhere is the overrideu
we cannot fire sir they have damaged the photon controls and the warp drive we must withdraw
rake her
ufull power damn youu
i shall avenge you 
what is the meaning of this attack where is the crew of the reliant
do not play with me kirk my hand is on the phaser control 
give me some time to recall the data on our computers 
i give you sixty seconds admiral
i have given you no word to keep admiral in my judgment you simply have no alternative
i take your point stand by to receive our transmission
here it comes now spock
all is well sir you have the coordinates to beam up genesis
first things first captain kill admiral kirk
we will be going to warp speed 
aye sir 
just the batteries sir i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes 
we do not have minutes can you give me phaser power
a few shots sir
i am going down to the station
uhura send to commander reliant prepare to be boarded
i am trying sir stand by
try the emergency channels
enterprise to reliant come in reliant
picture mr saavik
scotty let's have it
sensors captain
i say again this is enterprise please acknowledge signal please 
we will beam aboard alert transporter room 
i had me a wee bout  but dr mccoy pulled me through
oh a wee bout of what mr scott
my sister's youngest admiral crazy to get to space
mr scott the word is given
aye sir
no promises mr scott on your way
he will die  
admiral this is spock
engine room reports auxiliary power restored we can proceed at impulse power
admiral if we go by the book like lieutenant saavik hours could seem like days
i read you captain let's have it
not at present
right on schedule admiral just give us your coordinates and we will beam you aboard
midshipman first class peter preston engineers mate sir
yes sir
i see well shall we start with the engine room
the word is given warp speed
i am understandably curious
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality
so you said at the time speaking of which your protg's first rare  a trifle emotional 
she is half romulan jim the admixture makes her more volatile than  me for example
than you yes i see that by the way thank you for this
'it was the best of times it was the worst of times' message spock
none of which i am consciously aware  except of course happy birthday  surely the best of times
the enterprise i must check in before your inspection and you
welcome aboard admiral i believe you know my trainee crew certainly they have come to know you
yes we have been through death and life together
to be sure captain
regula i is a scientific research laboratory if memory serves
that will not be necessary just take me to regula i
you proceed from a false assumption i am a vulcan i have no ego to bruise
how far
twelve hours and fortythree minutes present speed
give up genesis she said what in god's name does that mean give it up to whom
it might help my analysis if i knew what genesis was
the power of creation 
have they proceeded with their experiments
the tape was made a year ago i can only assume they have reached phase two by now 
chekov's on reliant is not he
it would explain a great many things 
raise shields energize phasers stand by to 
who who knew just where to hit us and uwhyu
one thing is certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power
visual  mr sulu divert everything to the phasers 
too late 
who the uhellu are they
it is all we have got
wait for my signal spock  too soon and he will have time to figure it out and raise them again
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area
affirmative admiral
 blind as a tiberian bat what do you make of the plantoid beyond
regula is class d' it consists of various remarkable ores essentially a great rock in space
reliant could be hiding behind that rock
a distinct possibility
engine room scotty do we have enough power for the transporters
aye sir 
not much admiral we have partial main power
that is it
best we could do in two hours
she can outrun us and outgun us but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four
scotty can we make it inside
steady as you go
uhura patch me in 
he will not break off now if he followed me this far he will be back but from where
he is intelligent but not experienced his pattern indicates two dimensional thinking
or the one
i have an urgent commpic from space lab regula i for the admiral dr carol marcus
in my quarters uhura
yes sir
transmission jammed at the source sir
damn alert starfleet headquarters i want to talk with starfleet command
prayer mr saavik the klingons do not take prisoners  captain
permission to speak candidly sir
very well
i do not believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities
and why not
because there was no way to win
a nowin situation is a possibility every commander may face has that never occurred to you
 no sir it has not
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life would not you say
as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me
then you have something new to think about carry on
it is still regulation admiral
lieutenant selfexpression does not seem to be one of your problems
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
you earned it
i did not think so
you are bothered by your performance on the ukobayashi maruu
i failed to resolve the situation
there is no correct resolution it is a test of character
may i ask how uyouu dealt with the test
you may ask lieutenant
humor that is a difficult concept  it is not logical
we learn by doing lieutenant
energize defense fields
we are finding it  please upleaseu  you have got to give us time  the bridge is smashed computers inoperative
there is no such regulation
phasers on stun move out
if stage two was completed it was underground  she said it was going to be underground
stage two of what
the ukobayashi maruu sir
on the test sir will you tell me what you did i would really like to know
then  you never faced that situation  faced death
come come lieutenant you of all people go by the book hello spock you remember dr marcus
' no uncoded messages on an open channel'
they just do not want us going in there
at what
all stop sir
descend ten thousand meters stand by photon torpedoes
power levels quite low sir
mr scott can you get the mains back on line
aye sir
two minutes ten seconds
engine room that is happening
distance from reliant
i will be in my quarters if needed but i would prefer
understood sir
dismiss the company
as you were mr saavik
aye sir on course to ceti alpha all is well
good i believe you already know my uh son 
aye sir 
i am delighted any chance to go aboard enterprise however briefly is always an excuse for nostalgia
i cut your new orders personally by the end of the month you will have your first command uss excelsior
thank you sir i have looked forward to this for a long time
stop engines
engage warp engines 
trying sir
phasers locked
try again
battle stations
best guess mr sulu fire when ready
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
aye captain
i am aware of my responsibilities mister
 now entering the neutral zone
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission
i will try captain
aft thrusters sir
course heading captain
ready sir
honors  hup
no power to the weapons system sir
what did you expect lieutenant
he is very human
aye sir
thank you mr saavik
never sir
aye sir
lieutenant the admiral is aware of the regulations
aye sir
i exaggerated
you are half human the computer knows that
the question is irrelevant
where must you go
to earth to offer testimony
you do this  for friendship
i do this because i was there
spock does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one
i would accept that as an axiom
 they do indeed
just a couple of kooks
fine just fine
do not tell me fish stories kiddo i have known you too long
bob it is tearing me apart
indeed may i offer you gentlemen anything
a moment alone please
what do you mean
are you sure  that is what i thought
mr sulu take us home
no way  somebody has to keep an eye on him
spock start your computations for time warp  come on bones let's pay scotty a visit
we have done it before
that is crazy
if you have a better idea  now's the time
let's hope so bones mr sulu set us down in golden gate park
captain spock and i will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source
tearing of the middle meningeal artery
come on pavel
pavel can you hear me give me your name and rank
not me bones they did it
uhura is busy i am monitoring
forget it  how about covering a little philosophical ground life death life things of that nature
i did not have time on vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines
you are joking
a joke is a story with a humorous climax
you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death
pardon me doctor i am hearing many calls of distress
there are millions of other species on earth doctor only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man
i liked him better before he died
that is crazy who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale
that is what i said doctor
then how
hamlet act i scene 4
acceleration is no longer a constant
well you are gonna have to take your best shot
 best shot
guess spock your best guess
guessing is not in my nature
well nobody's perfect
no spock it means he feels safer about your guesses than most other peoples facts
it is
we are just  observing
i was not informed about observers
reading the patient's vital signs
how do you explain slowing pulse low respiratory rate and coma
fundoscopic examination 
fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases
a simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure
captain their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power
can you isolate the wave
negative it is impacting on all our systems
captain all systems have failed we are functioning on reserve power only
we are out of control  rig for collision
yes under us government now we need directions
i have the coordinates of the reactor
 it gives me a great sense of history
depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor
like what
like who you really are and what you are doing here and what this thing is
all right let's take it from the top
the top of what
no umyu name
i do not know your name
you play games with me and you are through
i am may i go now
i varn you if you do not lie on the floor i vill have to stun you
go ahead stun me
i am wery sorry but 
i am impressed mr chekov a lot of effort for a short voyage
that is odd uhura that is on the comm channels
shields aye
may fortune favor the foolish  mr sulu warp speed
sir heat shields at maximum
dr mccoy you mr scott and commander sulu will convert us a whale tank
and admiral it is the enterprise
understood what is your plan
stabilize energy reserve report helm
mr sulu switch to manual control
we do not know it is using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand
can you protect us
we are launching everything we have
communicate communicate what you have no right to be here
i suppose they told you that
the hell they did
i was not
is there something wrong with the one i have
why's that
the hell you were buster your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales
came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies huh
there's really very little point in my trying to explain
i buy that what about him
you have already been that c'mon
uh huh what about you where you from
go ahead
that is going to happen when you release the whales
what does that mean exactly take their chances
well that is something i woulda let you off right here
or believe i will bet
very likely you are not exactly catching us at our best
how did you know gracie's pregnant nobody knows that
it is his way
just lucky i guess
you are upset about losing the whales
 you are very perceptive
how will that be done exactly
they will be flown in a special 747 to alaska and released there
flown and that is the last you will see of them
you you cannot even get from sausalito to san francisco without a lift
if you have such a low opinion of my abilities how come we are having dinner
it is not so much a matter of a place as of time
sorry the time would have to be right now
what do you mean now
that is what
you got a pocket pager what are you a doctor
tell me when the whales are going to be released
 who are you
who do you think i am
no i am from iowa i just work in outer space
well i was close i knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later
all right the truth
i am all ears
you want the details
are you kidding i would not miss this for all the tea in china
then tell me when the whales are leaving
so there we are
yes and i am glad you are here though i will admit you picked a hellova time to drop in
have i flipped out  is any of this real
it is all real look  the storage tanks for the whales
but kirk
we will bring them up just like we brought you it is called a transporter beam
kirk they are gone
a spaceship with a missing man
calm yourself nurse  scotty get us out of here
yes if you have a chart on board i can show you
all i need is the radio frequency to track them
what are you talking about i am coming with you
you cannot our next stop is the 23rd century
what do i care i have got nobody but those whales
i have no time to argue gillian or even tell you how much you have meant to us the ufrequencyu
all right the frequency is 401 megahertz
thank you for everything  beam me up scotty
you need me
mr sulu full power descent
why does it have to be goodbye
permission granted
thank you admiral
jim spock jim remember
a distinct possibility admiral the president did say the transmission was directed at the earth's oceans
uhura can you modify the probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors
to the onboard computer room to confirm my suspicion
the sounds but not the language we would be responding in gibberish
is there any other planet where this species exists
the humpback was indigenous to earth earth of the past
that leaves us no choice we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth
that would be futile admiral the probe would neutralize us easily
but we cannot turn away is there no alternative
there is one but i cannot guarantee its success we could attempt to find some humpback whales
in progress admiral
uhura get me through to starfleet command
what is our target in time
the late 20th century
surely you can be more specific
not with this equipment i have had to program some of the variables from memory
what are the variables
i have
judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere i believe we have arrived at the late 20th century
well done mr spock
admiral if i may we are probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time
quite right spock mr chekov engage cloaking device
nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels
and they will be again spock that is the beauty of it  how much
 simple logic
ah the giants
why not
well for one thing you have not quite got the hang of it
i see
and another thing it is not always necessary to tell the truth
i cannot tell a lie
you do not have to lie you could exaggerate
the hell i cannot
what else did you learn from your mind meld
they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man
they have a right to be  do you think they will help us
i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions
 i see
that is cutting it closer than you know what about team two
no word since beamin we can only wait for their call
thank you spock
is that the logical thing to do spock
no admiral but is the human thing to do
right  will you help us
admiral you must wait one damn minute
uyouu  spock that is extraordinary
they did admiral
then where the hell are we
no data admiral computers are nonfunctional
weapons systems
continue on course chekov any signs of federation escort
steady as she goes
mr sulu we need breakaway speed
hang on sir nine point seven point eight breakaway threshold
steady  now mr sulu
 aye sir
what is our condition
sir braking thrusters seem to have fired
picture please
we will divide into teams commanders chekov and uhura are assigned to the uranium problem
go mr sulu
advise reaching 10000 steer threeonezero
threeonezero aye
uhura scan for the whales 401 megahertz
wing to cruise configuration full impulse power
aye sir threeonezero to the bering sea eta 12 minutes
hover on my mark mr sulu mr chekov stand by decloaking  scotty ready for power build up  mark mr sulu
picture uhura
ground cushion keep the nose up if you can 
aye sir
communications systems ready communications officer  ready as she will ever be
mr sulu
overlapping distress calls some from starships others
on screen
yes sir
on speakers
from a city that does not make sense
283 degrees 152 kilometers
everyone remember where we parked
nothing i should never have left him
uhura you did what was necessary  keep trying you will find him
uhura where
mercy hospital
put them on screen
on screen
sir estimating one nautical mile
mr scott  how soon
out of control and blind as a bat
give me one more day sir the damage control is easy reading klingon is hard
about 60 feet admiral
that should be enough can you enclose it to hold water
i suppose i can sir are you planning to take a swim
humpbacked  people
whales scotty 45 to 50 feet long about 40 tons a piece
admiral  how am i going to handle all that weight
you will work it out scotty and remember two of them
give me a round figure mr scott
sorry admiral we just thought you will like to know we are beaming them now
oh i see   tell them phasers on stun good luck kirk out
not good enough scotty you have got to do better
mr sulu
aye but i have never beamed up 400 tons before
how long scotty
10 seconds admiral 5  4  3  2  1
well done mr scott how soon can we be ready for warp speed
i will have to reenergize
do not take too long we are sitting ducks for their radar systems  mr sulu impulse climb
mr scott do not make jokes we are in danger of 
full power sir
mr sulu if you please
the beasties seem happy to see you doctor i hope you like our little aquarium
on my way
no power to the bay doors
the explosive override  
it is under water there's no way to reach it
go on ahead close the hatch
admiral you will be trapped
scotty do not prejudge a ship is a ship
thank you lt saavik
and here is a deposition i have made if it is not sufficient i will return to earth to testify
do not concern yourself saavik your leave has been granted for good and proper cause  how are you feeling
i am well admiral
you will be in good hands here
your vessel did destroy uss grissom your men did kill kirk's son do you deny these events
we deny nothing we have the right to preserve our race
do you have the right to murder
i demand to see the owners i demand 
well that is different
if you will follow me professor 
i will can my assistant come too
of course
sill what else would i be working with
just use the keyboard
the keyboard how quaint
that is the ticket laddie
 but it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix
right on you fly
oh here and there  i flew something similar in my academy days
all right then this is old stuff to you
old yes but interesting  do you mind if i ask a few questions
it is kind of you to make this effort
it is not an effort you are my son  besides i am most impressed with your performance in this  crises
most kind father
yes of course do you have any message for your mother
tell her i feel fine
gomen nasarei hito chigai de gozaranuka na  i am sorry my son you have mis taken me for someone else
ah chigaau hito da hanashi kata ga okashii  yes this must be true you talk funny
sulu hikaru
i do not want to scare them away
i do not see anything
it is there the fog's thicker now but it is there what do you think started those fires
probably kids
no we can handle this
i do not think so 
benny this is me i am going to take a look
thank you
have a nice trip
how much are your rooms
thirtyseven fifty for one person fortynine fifty for two
fill this out  will this be cash or credit card
credit card
i will have to run your card off now
we are only going to be here a few hours
it is still the full price
we should have let me see
i understand
what do you do
i make maps
hey that sounds interesting you like it
eh yes
make any money
it is beautiful
thank you
he is got a gun
what the hell do you think you are doing
where did you stop last
stay right there
what was your last stop
about five miles back
it is a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes
houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit
they must have picked it up in space
there's no mistake you are absolutely sure
i saw it with my own eyes we have killed an extraterrestrial and
is there any possibility that it is a hoax could you be mistaken
i am going to the white house right now i will try and get you everything you need
wait wait what are my orders if we find this thing
what do you mean by 'containg
we do not think that is necessarily bad at least it is a point of contact
not necessarily bad if they knew we were here why did not they let us know they were coming
we will get those answers when you find the one you are looking for
that is not going to happen george unless you get us the help you promised us
when can we expect containment
well we are in pursuit of a green mustang
it is in a green mustang
it is taken on a disguise
clarify that
it is made itself look like the womangs dead husband
oh shit
i do not like it george
dammit shermin earlier you were asking for help that is changed
it is messy the thing's got a gun we are just asking for somebody to get killed
we do not know what else to do we need results
you will get results one way or the other that is for sure okay
i am gonna be here if you need anything
i do not care where you are from you just cannot disappear into thin air
we have a new directive i am taking over
we do not have to do it that way we can catch him this time
washington thinks it is too late for that
no we do not
then you are going to have to do it without me
you are a career intelligence officer shermin you will be in the air with us
i am afraid we cannot let you go
shermin shermin
this is george fox
i want to speak to marc shermin
you can speak to me mrs haydn i am in charge of this operation now
if i do not speak to mr shermin i am hanging up
watch it they are coming out
i told you he let me go i am on my way home
get a highway patrol unit over there
marc shermin
he does not want to hurt anybody please leave him alone
is he on his way to lathrop wells
ah no
steering wheel
gear shift
gear shift
that way
we are going to have to stop for gas soon
what are you doing
you are full of tricks are not you
no gas
this car runs on gas

you want this ticket
the car will stop
not every car but a car will stop maybe not the first car maybe number eight number fifteen
tomorrow morning start hitchhiking right away and
i was afraid
it was a mistake
no my ship was doing a map of all the suns and
stars when a sun is far away we call it a 'star'
i do not understand 'friend'
sounds like your captaings going to get hell when he gets back home
what is hell
it is bad
he will
are you my friend
i have noticed do you understand what they are saying

this car will take me to las vegas i cannot go back
the police know about lathrop wells we have to go another way come on
come on
i must meet my ship

i feel better if i move
we are hundreds of miles from where you have to be
the cook
i cannot stay on this planet

how did you find him it is such an out of the way apartment can i fix you a drink
no thanks  some kid at the american express office  are you living here
did this place come furnished it does not look like dickie horrible is not it  so bourgeois
in fact the only thing which looks like dickie is you
what i think i am saying it something's going on he is either converted to christianity  or to something else
i suggest you ask dickie that yourself otello's is on delle croce just off the corso
tom ripley thank you sir

yes it is
marge good morning unusual weather
i think it might hurt her to know
marge has been telling us about the rings
you know i feel ridiculous i did not mention them yesterday  i clean forgot  ridiculous

we could go down to the bar  no need for you to 
no he should talk to you alone
where is mr maccarron
san remo the police are amateurs well my boy it is come to a pretty pass has not it

i am very pleased to know you master fettes
mr gray
that is right  gray the cabman i have had a bit of dealing with macfarlane in the past you know
of course  it is the soul of the business  the pay 
but cannot you give me any idea
how could i  i will do my best after all you see i am financially interested
good morning
i want you to help my little girl
i am only a student
did he tell you about georgina
ask this one favor 
of course i will
good morning mr fettes
it is a pity
i cannot do that  you heard macfarlane
save yourself master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned
he is a great doctor  a great man 
i am cold as ice
gray has no need to threaten you remember the trial
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums it was a famous case
and did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against burke
where can i find him
you do not went to find him your news will keep until i tell him
but i must tell him  he must know of it please  tell me where he is
and back with macfarlane and all that he stands for the next day
come in boy  come in
come  it is a chance to try out your bedside manner fettes  take a look at the child
excuse me
you are made for a doctor young man
well and are you not a good student
but richardson
from the municipal council  they are the bodies of paupers 
not if i have to be party to things like that dr macfarlane
i remember her
you are a man of the world fettes you would not hold me to promise given in drink
but i  well you see sir i met mrs marsh and told her
really fettes you irk me with your lack of understanding
but you did promise
you see it is completely out of the question
yes i suppose so
now you run off and see that pretty mrs marsh and explain to her
this girl was beautiful  a wild lassie from the highlands
we cannot be sure of that
i am sure  i mean to report it it is like burke and hare all over again
grave robbing is one thing  this is murder
wait doctor  wait  the child's fainting
he has his own idea of a joke perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs
dr macfarlane i wonder if you know what happiness you have brought those people
that is only our duty fettes  that is the end at which we aim with all this nasty business
that is the way of it fettes  you bring the lassie to me
they will be thinking of that too
tosh  fettes  it is not their grief i am worrying about  i am talking of our own end 
you have no thought of going there
no room there we will have to set it between us
it was a woman when we put her in
hold that lamp up  i must see her face
not yet
you will be a good doctor  i know all about doctors
why yes
the white horse  the horse that is going to greet me when he sees me
an old acquaintance eh
he was a nice horse
maybe there's another reason maybe you have not friends enough could that be it georgina
i want it 
i am not at the school anymore i left last night
i wanted to see the white horse 
your son ma'am  he must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so
they are uncommon bold the grave robbers  and the daft doctors who drive them on
i am by way of being a medical myself
a doctor
a student  i am studying under dr macfarlane  that is i have been studying until today 
do not call me that confounded name
medicine  that will keep  sit down
you will not have it
afraid of what
afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be
i am the best man for the job
why do not you do it then
oh yes you will  you will do it to oblige fettes and myself
that is a good boy toddy
do not call me that confounded name i tell you
hear him  did you ever see the lads play knife
you are uncommon friendly tonight toddy more like the old days
i have had some experience
the same look here gray 
what are you talking about i am an anatomist i know the body i know how it works
and you are a fool toddy  and no doctor it is only the dead ones that you know
i am a doctor i teach medicine
did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot
the nerve centers  the brain 
but what makes a thought start
in the brain i tell you i know
would you grudge me a glass with my old crony meg
i have ordered nothing from you
this is a gift
i take no gifts from you
this is a gift you will not return
get out of here
wait toddy that is not hospitable i want to discuss business
so toddy you have made me a disease eh
i cannot understand your hurt to me  but i must cut you out
we have never been friends
i have drunk enough tonight
another little drop will never do you any harm
the resurrection business that may end sooner than you think new laws may come
i would make you rich
it would not be half so much fun for me toddy as to have you come here and beg 
beg  beg of you you crawling graveyard rat
but then i would not have the fun of having you come here and beg again toddy
because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more toddy you are a pleasure to me
a pleasure to torment me
i want to speak to you alone  i saw something  i heard
what did you hear
i know 
only brother
i know that you kill people to sell bodies
give me money or i will tell the police you murder the subjects
no joseph i am not angry  here  another glass of brandy i will wager it is better than the doctor's
you mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together dig them up
no digging joseph the churchyards are too well guarded we will burke them
burke them
you are lately come to scotland joseph
i come from lisbon
but still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets
i never heard that song but what did they do
i will show you how it was done joseph  i will show you how they burked them
nearly a year
any attacks of pain since
yes doctor
is her pain sporadic or constant
it comes at intervals  they used to be months apart  but they have been growing more frequent   much more frequent
see here child when you have this pain in your back where is it

well when you figure it out wake me up
just what the hell is wrong with you

my stuff's in the trunk  god  you care more about that car than you do about most people
most people just cause me trouble but that car always gets me out of it
i think better when i drive
oklahoma city  jimmy's gonna wire me some money and then
you talked to him  is he mad  did you tell him
do you think darryl's having an affair
i do not think darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair
but you think he fools around
i do not know  i will not be
it is probably not a good idea
what did darryl say
i do not want to go that way  find a way that we do not have to go through texas
wait  what  you want to go to mexico from oklahoma and you do not want to go through texas
you know how i feel about texas we are not going that way

well i am not on drugs  but i might be crazy
i do not think i wanna hear what you are gonna tell me
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about   this is just a whole 'nother ball game

well to be honest the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda starting to get to me
i can see that
always looking on the bright side are not ya
gosh  it sure is
i always wanted to travel  i just never got the opportunity
well you got it now

what that is just gordongs bad taste
why could not he have just told you all these things
he talks loud and he loves his code

all his years at sea he never stopped talking about these islands
you miss him
he knows
you sound so sure
i am about this
i can take it
they have become what you wanted they are a crew  that is why he came
we were idealists
because we believed we could make an impact out here  self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing
i have not forgotten
phil he is not looking inside  he is just striking out at the world
he has a lot of hurt inside him
claiming their place in the world
hey  weigh  blow the man down

skipper uh the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side
well that is all part of it
we have got weather moving in from the west
everybody down  on the double
yes sir
north northeast  and dick please make a note of our final position
skipper called us out of the rigging
but your instinct was to lose sail
my instinct was to not get electrocuted
how old are you son
you came back tod  you came back
it was an act of god for christ's sake
what do you mean
it is me do not you see  terry's right i am the escape hatch  i disobeyed order
yes sir
i could not bring her down here until i knew you were safe
yeah sure
gieg chuck

me either
i feel like we can do anything
i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve
i thought this was your dream come true
that is not why he is sending me
why then
because it looks good
he does
you do not give him enough credit chas
it was a bad dream
shut up phil
like this
that is the difference
you only hurt yourself you know
like you really care  like any of you give a shit what happens to me
i guess
well that is just typical is not it
is it true phil
i gotta go
you were not there you do not know what happened
i know enough
well and it is pretty cool too ya know  being here together an all
we all have problems
i am pissing fire man
that is the point and skipper will slip off the hook
no i did not
i know you will
maybe it is an air raid
i just brought you something to eat
forget it
it does not matter  really  i am just sorry you got chewed out
do what
ya know it
that is like wondering if your mom and dad do it  who wants to know

would you um say it is a big storm
sometimes it gets exciting out here
i am here on behalf of the crew sir
the fact is we would like you to give phil another chance
he killed the dolphin
of what
of a fight he cannot win out here
it is his father sir  he is suffocating him  we have all seen it
i do not know
you should tell him  that is something he can take with him
so is violating international law
but you invited is aboard
your cannons made a compelling argument
he left his passport in curacao it is being mailed to panama
that is unfortunate  we will have to take him with us
let the blow drive the boat down wind  neutralize our canvas
i know
as you can see there's a lot to do
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind
happily it all worked out this time  bill take philip below and help him find a bunk
take good care of my son
he is a big boy
and of course we are
well you never can tell these days can you
well we have come to give our boy a little break from the monotony
i should be eating with the crew
humor me  eat it anyway

okay donut  whatever you say
i do not have to listen to this
you will if you wanna eat  right george
look save it for somebody else will ya  this ancient shit does not have anything to do with me
then he should not have written such a long poem mr lawford
read on young john  read on college boards are coming
he did not get to be under secretary of the air force by being neighborly
it seems we are short on singers
barometer's dropping  the first blow will come from the south  might get interesting
that is that
terry left his passport in curacao we could hide him
no  bring him on deck with the others
nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere
no self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you

we would come twelve thousand miles together through every kind of seas imaginable
except a white squall  with all due respect captain sheldrake they are only boys
they are much more than that sir
is it true that the reason you expelled philip boutillier
for killing a dolphin
 and that you invited him to strike you  to fight it out on the deck of your ship

scamming's a strong word

landon carter i was driving the car that 
what kind of a man are you son
no thanks gotta keep my wits for the drive home
 this your idea of small talk
i do not make small talk 
your book and your brown sweater and your hair that is more to know  
like what the moons of jupiter
cannot you have a normal conversation
i do not want to have any conversation
good cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person
'they will not'
'believe in yourself and they will let me ask you lizzie look in the mirror are you pretty '
'yes you areyou are bb beautiful'
 this play means a lot to me
this play

so you agree you need help
28 is do something illegal 42 is befriend an enemy
i am an enemy
kinda yeah

maybe a little of both
go for it
it is like a todo list but for my life
it is private
you want to tell me
spend a year in the peace corps make a medical discovery 
and you have to meet my father
do not bother
he is a softy got him wrapped around my finger
you think so
know so
yeah maybe i dunno
do you think i am strange
the world of the dead
could be
that is my telescope
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings 
but there are thousands of them made of floating ice 
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart
or building blocks for a world that never formed
looking for something  someone
i hope so  i think maybe she sees me now
the dirty snowball at its core
yeah  i am probably not going to be around next time it comes
in 76 years me neither
in ten words or less
but you think about him  it  her
do not you
you do not believe in anything
the bible why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles
interpreted by another guy like my father
your father does not like me
sometimes i do not even trust me
i am really glad you think so
you do not miss a thing
yes and
belinda's a very jealous person
that would be the reason
that is it exactly you are reading my mind 
then maybe you can read mine
healthy as can be
thank you so were you
you are hardly nice to anyone
and that would ruin your reputation how
that sounds like horseshit
it is not
prove it
you do not know the first thing about being someone's friend 
i do not want to be just your friend 
you do not know what you want 
you do not either take a look at yourself maybe you are scared that someone might actually like you 
and why would that scare me
because then you could not hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your god
yeah with a finish in about a decade
when i have something to say
it means you can do anything
why are you doing all this to impress me
no  but are you  impressed
why not
i am not allowed to date
i wanted this to be a date
i have to get you home by one
it is only 730
we are going somewhere after and no i did not ask your father

what are you talking about
you are straddling the state line you are in two places at once
you are sometimes not sure
i am sure pretty sure
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable
what do you actually know with religion
wonder beauty joy  love
maybe you are not supposed to

uncle alfred left for america  much to my mother's dismay

it is good to see you again uncle i have missed you
as i have missed you  sleep well child
too late for what dear child
in spirit only i am afraid
the boys need help
perhaps the truth is you do not really trust anyone
do not tell me you are on his side again
no apology necessary  that is the first time in thirty years
secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house do not you think
there's a lovely inn just down 
do not be silly alfred after all she is family
alfred am i pigheaded  is it always my way or the highway
no my boy  i am afraid none of us can
alfred i know you are sick  i can get you the best doctors
attending to heroes  no sir  my only regret is that i was never able to be out there with you
not all heroes wear masks
remember this  and remember it always  i am proud of you  and i love you too son
right here sir
what seems to be the problem
first ivy had an intoxicating effect on both dick and me  tonight my feelings spread to someone else
specify please
passion  of course  find the photo of ivy after the flower ball
it appears sir that someone has stolen the batsignal
oxbridge academy
their new computer sciences division  how did you know
i recognized the accent
hey i am the one who kicked ivy's botanical butt  personally  me  i did
you are going back to school
i am so sorry to trouble you but
my parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago  alfred has been supporting me ever since
whatever you say lady  it is all in a day's work for me
keep it
of course dick grayson ward of the fabulously wealthy bruce wayne why would you need a few hundred dollars
hey that is your problem
paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes you call that family
alfred's happy here
happy  you honestly do not know do you you cannot even see that is in front of your own eyes
divide and conquer
batgirl baatgirl baatgirl
crimefighter's rule number one never say that
i am afraid to ask
be ready for anything
what exactly are you doing
i do not know  it just feels right
damn  damn is not good
those targeting mirrors are frozen the sun beam will not work
i hate being lectured
freeze you are mad  this capsule will slaughter thousands
i did not kill your wife
nightwing  scourge of darkest evil
this is all about fashion for you is not it
it is the gear  chicks love the gear
mr freeze
the batcomputer tracks him heading for the gotham museum
the new antiquities exhibit  the second sun of the sudan
of course  he is going to steal the giant white diamond
no robin  he is going to jail
i thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs
how about nice to see you  glad you are here to save my life
surf's up
he will be here
i will borrow it from you  four million  
i can make it
i cannot believe we were fighting over a  bad guy
bad yes  guy no  this is one majorly beautiful evil person
i am totally over her  positively
me too  great stems though
open sesamechicken
no  her case is too advanced  but maybe someday with more research
just the beast
what are you talking about
why is she so desperate to kiss us i am betting her lips are poison
she knows who we are
i guess we will just have to kill her
kill her later  we have got work to do
maybe he melted
from the other side of the equator
do not make me kill you in front of the girl
dr pamela isley
what can i do for you doctor  a research grant  a hospital wing
actually i already work for you or did  your arboreal preservation project in south america
we cut our support  a conflict of ideologies  dr woodrue was a lunatic
i see you knew him
that lab was consumed by fire last week  how did you manage to escape
i have here a proposal showing how wayne enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment
people come first dr isley
i cannot  but perhaps tonight over dinneri have just had an opening
but soon
what  i am sorry  you were saying
i know you are a dedicated bachelor that you have had a your wild nights
wild does not exactly cover it
but there's nothing you have done under the cover of darkness i could not learn to understand
i would not bet on that
i wish i knew
somehow he survived  but the cryoslution mutated his body
presumed dead  no one knows
we gonna trap ourselves a snowman
absolutely  just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator
whoa i made a mistake  i am sorry do not go all protective on me  it will not happen again
dick you were reckless  you could have been killed
you left your back wide open  freeze could have killed you
anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who joanna clark is
but he is never said a word
i am scared dick  maybe for the first time in my life  i am really scared
i am late for the dedication  then i go after freeze and ivy  alone
like hell you do
dick do not push me right now
her name is pamela isley  i saw her talking to gordon  she must have stolen his keys altered the signal
and she did it all for me  for love
she is infected us with some kind of pheromone extract
is that it bruce  i am under some magic spell
she wants to kill you
you would say anything to keep me away from her  to keep her for yourself
let's cool it for now  there's someone i want you to meet
i always go a size smaller  makes me look slimmer
i wonder if i can get a cell with a view of the gardens
dear daisy do not despair
you are looking unseasonably hot let's go inside and grab your rocks
you leave batman and robin to me
fine  while i retrieve my diamonds you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair  she is frozen in 
hold it  you never said anything about a wife frozen or otherwise
ok ok  ms ivy to the rescue  now where do i find your brittle bride
where is my wife
there was nothing i could do  batman deactivated her  she is dead
you lie
cannot we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry
that is far too merciful  batman will watch his beloved gotham perish then i will kill him
inspired ms ivy
i am hungry  i think i will have poultry
not good
i find that unlikely
what say we turn up the heat
you are skating on thin ice  my passion thaws for my bride alone
forget your frosty femme  these lips are wet and ready to get frostbite
hop away little bunny  before i cool your jets  permanently
at you  polly want a kiss
of trust tell me your plan
kiss me and i will tell you
tell me and i will kiss you
freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun  he is about to turn gotham into an ice cube
i have got to stop him
one kiss my love  for luck
what do you mean
you should have heeded your pointy eared pal  these lips can be murder
then you never loved me
sorry to disappoint you  but rubber lips are immune to your charms
you must show me your secrets blossom before i show you mine
our work
without your research i could never have come this far  join me  the two of us entwined side by side
hello jason  i think i have had a change of heart
i think they are getting worse
it is a wonder you sleep at all
then you would have nothing to complain about
hardly a worry sir
a few hitches sir but i am confident we will have a prototype in no time
it will never work
i believe you said the same thing about the batmobile
she has an excellent mind
if i misinterpreted your interest in the lady i humbly apologize
i wonder if she would go out with me
apology hastily retracted
your parents' wake rain fell like tears
ninetythree including the sauna
take any three you like after you get settled we can
he killed them twoface he slaughtered that boy's parents
no you said i i killed them
do not be ridiculous
is he all right
i am afraid master dick has gone traveling
he ran away
actually he took the car
he boosted the jag  is that all
not the jaguar the _other_ car
the _rolls_
_no_ sir _the_ _other_ _car_
which they' might that be sir
jack napier's dead my parents are avenged the wayne foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs
why indeed
could i let batman go for dick for me could i leave the shadows have a life friends family
dr meridian
how as batman knowing she wants me or as bruce wayne and hope
not that young it is been a long time since you have called me that
old habits die hard are you alright
as well as can be expected i guess give me the bad news
there's one other thing i feel
no demons son  your monsters are here until you fact that i fear you will spend your life fleeing them
batman alfred i am batman
but 1 3 1 8 & 5 what do they mean
what do maniacs always want
recognition of course
precisely so this number is probably some kind of calling card
of course 13 is mmre
how about mr e
claw island nygma's headquarters i am sure that is where they are keeping chase  are all the batsuits destroyed
all except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of but it has not yet been tested
tonight's a good night
how ya doing al
how come this is the only locked door around this museum that is back there
master wayne's dead wives
just checking young sir
four seconds from
i am flattered not every girl makes a superhero's night table  you might have some interesting insights into twoface
why's that
that is wrong
are you trying to get under my cape doctor
a girl cannot live by psychoses alone
it is the car right chicks love the car
try a fireman less to take off
i do not mind the work pity i cannot see behind the mask
my life's an open book you read
i am not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic
we could give it a try i will bring the wine you bring the scarred psyche
you are direct are not you
you like strong women i have done my homework or do i need skintight vinyl and a whip
maybe you just have not met the right woman
did twoface call him bruce
no more tricks edward release chase and dick this is between you and me
for _me_ really tell me
i see without seeing to me darkness is as clear as daylight what am i
oh please you are blind as a bat
umi am pretty sure i am bruce wayne and you are
precisely that is on all our minds brainwaves the future of wayne enterprises is brainwaves
wait you cannot go
we will talk some other 
no do not leave me my invention i need you
what oh edward hi congratulations great party
gracious even in defeat how vaguely disappointing when all this could have been ours together
actually i like to divest just before a major recapitalization
somebody's been sending me love letters commissioner gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion
just ones this beautiful
the infamous wayne charm does it ever shut off
on occasion usually at night
she is a malaysian dream warden she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams  need one
me no only things that need calming in my dreams are the rockettes
wacko that a technical term
patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles work better for you
so what you are saying this guy's a total wacko right
so this riddler he is dangerous
what do you know about obsession
not much
the letter writer is obsessed with you his only escape may be
to kill me
you understand obsession better than you let on
no insights here doc just trying to get comfortable on your couch  oops times up
that is usually my line
look i would love to keep chatting
would you i am not so sure
but i am going to have to get you out of those clothes
excuse me
and into a black dress
i am sorry who are you
what this is not normal
i do not get you bruce wayne
me i am easy especially after a couple of martinis
the glib cavalier routine it really is an act is not it
do not believe it i am just skin deep
bruce much to my surprise you seem like a really great guy
fast work you just moved here
you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang i think he felt it too
he sure did
why do i feel like the other man here
come on bruce this is what i do for a living
i would say this goes a little beyond taking your work home
what do you want me to say that i am not attracted to him
i am not
keep me off the couch doc your fees are a little rich for me
touchy touchy
so how goes your scholarly' pursuit of batman
oh god bruce you are still jealous
spare me the diagnosis okay you are being ridiculous i cannot be jealous of batman  can i
excuse me boys i would hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account
okay tiger take it slow you going to give me your pin or something
i do not want to remember

dr burton tells me you know who batman is

he is all yours and i am not your partner
then they were not created to go after your patient zero
no  they have been training to hunt you
the house of pain
i have not forgotten
i will heal
what about nomak
he escaped  you did not tell me they were immune to silver and garlic
i did not know
from the surveillance footage in the bloodbank  he was one of the guard's nomak attacked
which means he turned about seventytwo hours ago
nomak's different  he is the carrier  there's something driving him beyond the thirst  something we are missing
exactly  look at the digestive system it is been drastically simplified  super charged  and this 
you do not have to hunt to do it
fry 'em
i do not think so
for what
it would have been easy for you to let me die back there today but you did not
i would not read too much into it
it does not have to be like that  we do not have to be enemies
i am a hunter  a weapon  it is what i do  it is in my blood
pain cuts the deepest is not that what you said
i do not understand
not good
i want to see the sun rise
like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth
did you think i would not
took you long enough
you put a bullet in my brain  would not expect anything else
either that or feeding the worms
sounds like a plan
what do you really think
i do not like it
i am not giving you a choice old man
ran into a little reaper trouble myself
i will show you
i would not worry about it
what the hell is that supposed to mean
where the hell have you been
just out connecting a few dots
why do not you ask your girlfriend
look i care about the humans who are dying not you got it
spare me the race card oj  we are not going out into the sun  it is too risky
you do not have a choice  you are just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can
thought you were dead
seems like there's a lot of that going around these days
not alone
i should think that would be obvious at this point
revenge  that is what nomak wanted all along  to pay back the people who created him
ultrarapid detox  they use it on heroin addicts make 'em go coldturkey in one night
i do not know about this man 
keep your friends close and your enemies closer  is not that how the saying goes
he was here  watching us
you are wasting your time blade  the flechette's a dud
getting your attention paco
well you have got it warmblood  now what the fuck are you gonna do with it

from his father of course
you experimented on your own son

maybe it is better that way
any casualties
two so far
no  this is a dangerous game you are playing damaskinos
as scripted  you have already lost two of your own  how many more are you willing to sacrifice
not that i am in contact with
nobody to call in case of an emergency

it depends  we came up with some unusual results on your blood test

tell me about it
you have to ask
how did you meet him
they took over a club i was working at  caesar started managing it
he is a launderer
almost five years
five years is a long time
yes it is
the redistribution of wealth
that is what i tell someone when i am trying to get them in my bed
i am already in your bed
my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught  she was always more honest than me
i guess i wanted to
i am glad you did
so am i
shit here we go
you did not want to see me did you
if there is one thing i cannot stand about sleeping with women it is all the fucking mind reading
what are you afraid of
i am not afraid of anything
i do not understand  
i know  you cannot understand because we are different violet  we are different
we are not that different corky
how can you sit in that bed and say that
because it is the truth
is that what her daddy tells her
i know what i am  i do not need to have it tattooed on my shoulder
what are you saying  that you do not have sex with men
i do not
for christ's sake violet  i heard you  thin walls remember
what you heard was not sex
what the fuck was it
you mean shelly
do not tell me you are a workaholic
no  shelly knows what i am  he saw me in a bar with another woman
i suppose he just wants to watch
i think so too
you made a choice once  do you think you would make that same choice again
what choice
if those quarters fell to the floor would you still reach up to that cash register
how much money
shelly said it was over two million dollars
i am but 
you think i am lying
is that what you think
i think 
he hung it up
in his office  i saw it this morning
does the case lock
like each other  they hate each other
marzzone  as in angelo marzzone head of the marzzone family
that is his brother
what happened
johnnie hits on anything in high heels
has caesar ever seen him
he does it right in front of him
it is getting better and better keep going
scotch glenlivet  i remember that caesar made a huge deal about it
the plane is in at seven so i would say about eight
any bodyguards
gino travels with a big man named roy  caesar calls him the driver
poor boy has to work so hard
waiting in the apartment next door
an accident
shit  oh shit
he will not
trust me violet
if he does 
when i get the scotch how do i know you will not take off
the same way i will know that you went to scotch  trust
c  shit i am sorry
if he runs everyone will assume he took the money
you will be clean and we will be rich
thank you
if you are this goddamn smart how did you ever get caught
i will not
i think we are going to find out
what happened
that is okay as long as he believes it was johnnie
that means he probably will kill johnnie
oh christ i got to get out of here
we are almost there violet  just hang on
i am still here
i was so afraid you 
you do not quit on me violet and i will not quit on you
do not be sorry  help me

these shoes are itchy
this is kind of a stream
no  it has to be underwater
edward wood sir
ah  the director of glen or glenda
hhow would you know
i am criswell  i know all
i do not understand
i made it up  it is horseshit
it is that easy
cris you made it  thanks a lot
my pleasure  i am always happy to assist in a little larceny
i told you the octopus is made of rubber  this is a piece o' cake
yeah  it seems a little crazy but sometimes uyou just knowu  she is perfect for me
we will do our best
is not he
no  they say his eligibility ran out years ago
ed it was only one review
orson welles was 26 when he made citizen kane  i am already 30
ed you are still young  this is the part of your life when you are usupposedu to be struggling
i know but sometimes i get scared this is as good as it is gonna get
aw er it is just a bunch of hot air i had to say something to get in the door
you got the job
huh  oh uh no i did not get the job but something ubetteru happened
better than not getting a job
yeah  i met a movie star  somebody ureally bigu
who  robert taylor
no  a horror movie star
boris karloff
close  the uotheru one
you met basil rathbone
oh the hell with you  i met bela lugosi
i thought he was dead
it is a shame  he is such a rest actor and nobody uses him anymore
so did you get his autograph
this is my way of telling you 
of course it is  and that is why you should play the part
oh  you got nerve buddy
uthat is not the issueu  ugh  how can you act so casual when you are dressed like that
it takes me comfortable
oh just like in the script
hong nobody's bothered but you  look around  they could not care less
ed this is not the real world you have surrounded yourself with weirdos
say it a little louder  i do not think bela heard you in his trailer
some weirdo who likes to wear dresses
i do not know  it is so much money
who cares  we are on a roll  these are the moments in life you are supposed to grab
but ed we are not even married  and you do not have a job
toss us out on our ass
ed it is just one mangs opinion
well maybe you are not studio kind of material  maybe you just need to raise the money yourself
tell him bride is in pre production
ed the landlord does not care
dolores do not you understand  i am a director now  i made glen or glenda  directing uisu my day job
all i know is ever since glen or glenda all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes
who do you think's been paying the rent  who helped type your script and did all your grunt work
i am sorry  what did you want me to say
i wanted you to say no  i wrote the part for my girlfriend dolores
but there's plenty of other parts
like uwhatu
the secretary  or the file clerk
i told you this was gonna happen
maybe if you would come to the backers party i would have gotten the money
that is moronic  why would a bit player impress a backer
look how many times can i say i am sorry  i blew it  i thought she was rich
that is a good reason to dump your girlfriend
ui did not dump youu  get it through your skull  i just recast the part
so what  look we gotta figure out where we are gonna stay
i am going to my mother's
does she have room for me
of course i am here  today is the file clerk's big scene
that is right
i see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here  say who's the lug
oh really  how much money did he put up
none  but his dad gave me fifty grand
wood productions  the mark of quality
hey uthe movie's getting madeu that is the main thing
oh  er well you are the file clerk  you are hurrying into the next room when you bump into janet
but that is our relationship  are we good friends or is she just a casual acquaintance
dolores i got five days to shoot this movie  quit kidding around
ed it is over  i need a normal life
did you really mean those things you said
but you used to say 
ed i just stuck it out so you could finish your movie  now that it is done so am i
i understand you just moved here
yes  hollywood is oh so exciting
perhaps a small amount of money  how much do one of your motion pictures cost
for this one we need $60000
that is all  that seems very reasonable for an entire picture
i do not know  hey bill which dress is better for you the green or the red one
well then you should pay him should not you
yeah  exactly
what are you looking at me like that for  i already gave you my three hundred
yeah  well i need the other sixtythousand
what other sixtythousand
the other sixtythousand you said you would give me
you misunderstood  i gave you everything i have in the world threehundred dollars
sure thing mr kravitz
that is not true 
he is so great uyouu hire him
well uh if i could i would
it is wood  ed wood
well mr feldman some people have resumes to show  i have got my own movie
really  well good for you
i just made this picture over at screen classics  it opens next week
screen classics  hmm do not know them
nobody in town has seen it so i am giving you first crack at my talents
i cannot wait to take a look  so that is up next
udr aculau
but bela lugosi's in it
lugosi's washedup  what else you got
i am real sorry  my stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account c'mon in i will write you another one
you could say that 
oh  our church has the money for one film  we just do not have it for all twelve
absolutely  you see this script
graverobbers from uwhatu
it is a guaranteed blockbuster
um i understand that this science friction is popular  but do not the big hits always have big stars
yeah well we have got a big star bela lugosi
ulugosiu  did not be pass on
just it does not look like very much
look lugosi is dead and vampira will not talk   ihad to give usomebodyu the dialogue
perfect  mr wood do you know uanythingu about the art of film production
i like to think so
that cardboard headstone tipped over this graveyard is obviously phony
people will not notice  filmmaking is not about picky details  it is about the big picture
da pleasure be mine
oh of course
mm not goodlookink enough
i think you are quite handsome
no  with hair yah  but i must shave head for wrestlink  it scare da crowds  dey like that
but what bout accent  some people tink i haf too much accent
nah that does not matter  it is a visual medium
hopefully very soon  i am just awaiting the final okay from mr feldman at mgm
really  was the third act too intense
no  she tink lobo is waste of my time  lobo do not talk
but tor it is a starring part you are second billed
bela he talk  loretta she talk but tor he no talk
uh i do not have much of an appetite lately
the food will make you feel bedder look at me  i am da happiest guy i know
do not worry  you just have not met right woman yet  oopsy  that cabbage goes right through me
nonsense  you must try our hot glug
but i thought me and dolores had something
forget her  move on  a good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish
do not worry  we are almost there
we are escaping
my pleasure  i am orson welles
oh  um i am ed wood  so what are you working on now
ugh i hate when that happens
and they always want to cast their buddies  it does not even umatteru if they are right for the part
yes i am ed wood  i am here about directing the christine jorgensen picture
fuck no  but there's a poster
no no not at all  i uloveu women wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them
so you are not a fruit
nah i am all man  i even fought in ww2  'course i uwasu wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform
you gotta be kidding me
yeah but if you took that crap and put a star in it you would have something
yeah  crap with a star
no  it would be something better something uimpressiveu  the biggest moneymaker you have ever had
is not he dead
uh yeah  our picture
because he is umy friendu
there's still a sexchange 
yeah  five pages right before it ends  the rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters
i do not think he is a schmuck
and that is with this new title  my poster says i changed my sex
uthen how is it gonna get in theu upictureu
yeah  whatever  so did you like it
good  and one more thing  i think your written directed and starring ed wood credit is a bad idea
why  i did all those things  hell i even built the props
yeah  well orson welles did not wear angora sweaters did he
i did  i established some tits and ass
why not
i got married last night
oh  congratulations
the marriage already ended

bela died
ed you have got to snap out of this bela's dead  uyou are notu

you were at 4000 kelvin  any hotter you are approaching supernova 
dude  that is my sister
you gave us unamesu  what are you the face of the fantastic four now

no ui amu sorry for pushing you out
sis  let umeu take care of uyouu for once
but johnnyyou ucannot flyu
and if he is not
reed's ualwaysu right  good thing he does not always know what he is got
it is not just the money  i could make money in my sleep
then what is it
history leonard  uhistoryu everything else is conversation  how is the other matter
recording sir  we see you perfectly
stable  we are looking at low twenties  it is a good number considering the fallout from 
reed's disaster  you know i half think he did this to me on purpose
sir i am sure he would not put himself 
and that is a ugoodu thing
later  first i have got some unfinished business  a deal that needs closing
front page
top left like you asked  today wall street  tomorrow who knowsmaybe washington
not at all
the number's useventyfiveu  and it is applications uandu patents
so reel him in  but we came here to do a ujobu  so let's do it  uquicklyu
reed we are running out of time
it is too late for him and soon it will be too late for all of us
ben did this
ubenu did this
he is had some kind ofreaction to exposure from the cloud  and he is not the only one
not much  we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage
uiu ruined  with all due respect i told you to abort 
what i ushouldu have done a long time ago  applications and patents reed this all belongs to me
never better
i was talking about us  working together
it is been changed
great minds think alike
yes thanks
that is good  that is uhgood
you always had a way with words  i should be getting back
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship 
which was
what  what do you mean you 
sueilook at your handsi
let's not jump to conclusions we need a imassive amount of evidencei before making that leap
what  uohu
that is what we are here to find out
if it happened to him then it could
excuse me
okay  is there any way to duplicate that feeling  some memory or
i am sure i can come up with something
are you kidding
no i distinctly remember uyouu walked out umyu door  ergo
i think it was a little more complicated than 
i just wanted to share an apartment what was so complicated about that
and reverse the mutations 
curing countless diseases not just ours
of course  of course
and you sure you can control this thing  last time did not work out so well
with the right energy we can stabilize the storm  maybe tie into the city grid
no way to know  without more tests experiments
he was going to take away all my data equipment 
better than your ulifeu  victor's not the one who has to get into that thing  uweu are
every variable but uyourselfu  you do not eat sleep  you cannot live in your head like 
ui amu not the only one in there  i got you vic ben johnny all rattling around in there
reed  shh  just be quiet  and look up
you uwereu
i gave him twenty
why did not you say something
that would have kinda defeated the purpose  and reed  i am saying it now
reed stop you need to rest your 
the poweri needmore powerto controlthe storm 
you uneedu a doctor
i am sure i can come up with something
a ugasketu  reed we are at a party
i think you both know my director of genetic research susan storm
i understand the ibusinessi reasons
well when you are looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past
raising the shields
you cannot leave them out there
victor are you feeling alright
just ufindu him
i told you i am fine  it is uyouu i am worried about
i am sorry i did not get a chance to 
it is  there's something we need to talk about  something i need to ask you
same old reed  all analysis no action  was not that the problem with you two
oh i think you already have
victor we ucannot do anythingu until the research is ready
for your sake i hope you are right i am sorry if that sounds a little skeptical
where is tyler
the first rule of project 
right right
no  look at you  you are you are running around in ski masks exploding things
he was killed serving project mayhem
sir you are disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior
there's no one else here
i am sorry i have not the faintest idea what you are talking about
look at my face  i am a member  i just need to know if you have seen tyler durden
i am afraid i have to insist you leave
we are still men
yes  we are men  men is what we are
bob  i am okay  how are you
better than i have ever been in my life
really  great  still remaining men together
really that is that
the first rule is you are not supposed to talk about it
bob bob i am a member
you are
look at my face
yeah both of us
it must have been tuesday  he was wearing his cornflowerblue tie
you want me to deprioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade
you need to make these your primary action items
he was full of pep  must have had his grande latte enema
here are your flight coupons  call me from the road if there are any snags  your itinerary
have you finished those reports
some of it yes
the second rule of fight club is this yours
abuse the copy machine  there's an image
pretend you are me  you find this what would you do
okay  where to begin  with your constant absenteeism  with your unpresentable appearance  you are up for review
i am jack's complete lack of surprise
i am jack's cold sweat
does this sound strange to you
yes sire strange  very strange
what does that mean
it means it was homemade
this is really a shock
i will ask the questions son
maybe i died already  look at my face
you need to lighten up
cannot you give me something
redandblue tuinal lipstickred seconals
you need healthy natural sleep chew valerian root and get some more exercise
you want to see pain  swing by first methodist tuesday nights  see the guys with testicular cancer  that is pain
practicing what
telling me off  is it going as well as you hoped    mr taylor
i will expose you
go ahead  i will expose you
it is cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee
these are my groups  i was here first  i have been coming for a year
a year  how would you manage that
anyone who might have noticed either died or recovered and never came back
 instead of just waiting for their turn to speak
candystripe a cancer ward  it is not my problem
please  cannot we do something 
you take tuberculosis  my smoking does not go over at all
i think testicular cancer should be no contest
well technically i have more of a right to be there than you  you still have your balls
you are kidding
i do not know  am i
you cannot have both parasites  you can take blood parasites 
i want brain parasites
okay  i will take blood parasites and organic brain dementia 
i want that
you cannot have the whole brain
so far you have four and i only have two
then take blood parasites  it is yours  now we each have three
the girl had done her homework
we will split it  you get it the first and third sunday of the month
let's not make a big thing out of it

the forwarding number  i have not seen you at any support groups
that is the idea  we split them
you have not been going to yours
i found a new one

when is it finally over  i want it to be over before my baby is born

i cannot let him down
yeah give me a minute
twothirty  that gives me time to see my boy

he is been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years
that plane goes to miami

he is ten times tougher than me my brother  he is oldfashioned
yeah  he would not even go out to dinner  just wanted to go home
tom what do i do now
thanks tom  thanks
actually i have come with good news the corleone family has done you a favor
do you gamble
a little that is so thought provoking about that
do you owe markers
maybe two three thousand dollars
our mistake  but what does it matter it was our money  we do not even expect thanks
you paid off thirty grand i never owed
we will keep it quiet the people who know are trustworthythe committee need not find out
and that is the price of their not finding out
simple  be friendly like us  not hostile
i do not think that is necessary
yes sir  his name is vincenzo pentangeli
is he related to the witness
he is i believe a brother
this meeting is adjourned
this committee owes an apology
the committee is adjourned until further notice
i am going to the market
if you could just give us a list we will pick up anything you want
whose orders are these
mr hagengs ma'am
this is my boy and my wife  mr john ola of miami
sleeping inside me
does it feel like a boy
yes michael it does
i wanted to see you before you went back to nevada  also the children  michael they are here
i am not going to stay long i cannot
tell me michael  what really happened with pentangeli
his brother came to help him
i did not even know he had a brother and where is he now
on a plane back to sicily
and that is all he had to do  just show his face
kay i told you
goodbye michael
i will not let you leave  christ do you think i am going to let you leave
at this moment i feel no love for you at all  i never thought that could happen but it has
we will go back tonight  bring the children
you have not heard me
who's asking
where can we talk
right here
you said you were klingman
you do not come in here talk to an owner in las vegas like that
you missed my point you are no longer an owner
get out of my hotel
i am alright  will you stay home for awhile
there are still things i have to do
well we can all have a nice dinner together tonight  how are your eyes
no i meant lose his family
your family  how can you ever lose your family
but times are different
not for a few years
you are a great man mr roth i have much to learn from you
however i can help you
the rosato brothers have performed services for you in the past i understand that they are under your protection
we do favors for each other
pentangeli is a dead man do you object
it is always bad for business but you have no choice
then it is done  i must choose his replacement it cannot be rosato
of course you must keep control of your family
it means &quotthe lie&quot
except the president of the united states
who had frankie pantangeli killed
whythe rosato brothers
i know that but who gave the go ahead
very impressive
jake jake come over here  mike i want you to meet jake cohen he manages the casino for us
sure i remember tom from the old days
how is his health
not good
is there anything i can do anything i can send
he appreciates your concern michael and your respect
okay  you know he does not have that kind of money
is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in las vegas
i do not
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york
i do not
when do we talk
after dinner
we were all heartbroken at the news but that was not cause to start a war
says who
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died and then you took over and welched
clemenza promised them nothing he hated the sonsuvbitches
they feel cheated
and while i feed my family in new york you put the knife in my back in miami
i know  that is why i want you to be fair with them
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood
frankie you know my father respected roth did business with him
he did businessbut he never trusted him
i did not want you to know i was coming  you heard what happened in my home
michael yes we was all relieved
michael anything  what is it i can do for you
i want you to settle these troubles with the rosato brothers
i was just going to contact you michael we just had a 'sitdowng  in fact i just come from there
i want you to settle on their terms
mike i do not understand  do not ask me to do that
trust me do as i ask
then why do you want me to lay down to them
frankie roth tried to have me killed  i am sure it was him but i do not know yet why
jesus christ michael then let's hit 'em now while we still got the muscle
i thought we would meet alone
i trust these men with my life they are my right arms i cannot insult them by sending them away
some water
all right then let me say you will pay me because it is in your interests to pay me
keep them alive
it is important
no she is here
sitting right behind you
we worked it all out beforehand
are we going to eat or what
sure on me  i got diner's club
forget it i am suddenly without an appetite  you are making big trouble carmine
you were not straight with us frankie what else could we do
we could have talked first saved a lot of running around
you was not listening you did not want to talk
do not i look like i am listening
my lawyer went over this beforehand
what assurances do i have that there will be no more kidnapping no more hits
the same assurance we got from you
what if i say shove it
then carmine fucillo and tony blue derosa will need to be fitted for slabs
you want a war
we got no choice
i am talking about italians

it is important
i will be here
not since 1963 since it happened every kid in haddonfield thinks this place is haunted
they may be right
could have
he is not a man
looks like to me you are just plain scared
he was here earlier tonight and he may be coming back i am going to wait for him
i keep thinking i should call the radio and tv stations
you are not coming up with much to prove me wrong
exactly what do you need
well it is going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes
i found the car he is here
it is your own fault and i do not feel sorry for you
the only reason she babysits is to have a place to
i do not think so
nothing i was just sitting down for the first time tonight
is annie around
no i thought she would be home by now she went to pick up paul
well she is totally not here
have a good time
hi tommy
same time same place
can we make jackolanterns
sure sure
uhuh that is a spook house
just watch
see you
but king arthur was always your favorite
why are they under there
mom does not like me to have them
laurie that is the boogey man
after the movie
what about the rest of my comic books
after the jackolantern
what about the bogyman
there is no such thing
richie said he was coming after me tonight
do you believe everything that richie tells you
there was no one outside
there was
what did he look like
the bogyman
we are no getting anywhere all right look tommy the bogyman can only come out on halloween night right
can we make the jackolantern now
i saw him
tommy let me in
what is it laurie
be quiet get lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door
i am scared
do what i say now
it is the bogyman is not it
was it the bogyman
but you cannot kill the bogyman
no do as i say
let's make more popcorn
you have had enough why do not we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie
there's nothing to be scared of now get changed
you are coming with us
yes she is
will you get her for me
she is washing her clothes
well go tell her it is me okay
of course not
i have given them his profile
i notified everybody nobody listened
there's nothing else i can do
i am wasting time
he was doing all right last night maybe somebody around here gave him lessons
that is the idea here we are
are there any special instructions
just try to understand what we are dealing with here do not underestimate it
i think we should refer to 'it' as 'him'
if you say so
your compassion is overwhelming doctor
only minimum security
i see
what does that mean
it means i see
you do not have to make this harder than it already is
i could not if i tried
the only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish when they start raving on and on
you do not have anything to worry about he has not spoken a word in 15 years
should not we pick him up
move it
he asked me if i could help him find his purple lawnmower
i do not think this is any time to be funny
he said something else it is all right now he is gone the evil's gone
that is that
i am not sure    but it is proving to be very popular
we are pretty handy with model making too eh
are you a carpenter mr rieper herbert shakes his head
i work at dennis brothers fish supply
playfully shoves his hand away
come on through
and pauline hurriedly work together setting out plates and cutlery
look who i have found
whips off her pinny as herbert leads juliet into the dining room
pops a couple more potatoes on pauline's plate herbert glances at pauline
thought i would have a go at building the birdhouse on saturday    anyone want to give me a hand
sits down next to honora glass of sherry in hand
i have just had hilda hulme on the phone
what now
she says juliet's in a terrible state   
breaks down into heavy sobs
pulls his coat on honora gives him a peck cheek
well    i better make myself a bit more presentable
glows with pride steve is emptying his pockets on the bench honora pats steve's hand
leads a young manjohninto the dining room
comes in with a breakfast tray bacon and eggs tea and toast
come on sit up
i am not hungry
you have got to eat yvonne you hardly touched our dinner i am not having you falling ill
i just want to be on my own for a while
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to pauline
you may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl but i have not
holds up a loaded fork pauline reluctantly takes it
do you think juliet could stay here while her parents are away
juliet's infectious    she will be going to hospital
but she will have no one to look after her
her parents will not be going overseas now    they will have to cancel their trip do not worry about juliet
grabs pauline by the shoulders
whirls around and slaps pauline on the cheek
you ran off with dad when you were only 17 nana parker told me
steps back
it is a letter from the school    from miss stewart
what does old stew want
i care    your father cares    we want you to have a good education
i am educating myself
you are failing english    you used to be top of the class pauline i am doing my own writing
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile
these stories are not going to get you school certificate you do not seriously think anyone's going to publish them
all right you go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way
open this door
do not be so ridiculous you are our daughter you belong here with us
i belong with deborah we are going to south africa
you are not going anywhere you are 15 years old
you have to let me go
stands and walks toward the door
oh no i am watching my figure
looks down at the ground in front of her
i have heard your mother on 3ya the womangs session has lots of lively debate
well actually mummy's left that programme now   she is far too busy with the marriage guidance council
oh no    mummy's awfully good at it
hurries over
i am the matrongs favourite patient and she is shown me her special stitch
gives her a sympathetic look
i know it is hard for you being in here but it is for the good of your health
i am sorry mrs rieper i am feeling quite fatigued
we do not want to tire you out dear
stands and picks up her handbag pauline stands and juliet grabs her hand
cannot you stay a bit longer paul
ohwhat a nice outfit
thank you i bought it especially mrs rieper
turns around and juliet presents her with a brown paper bag
i put on a lot of weight over christmas

that was what we were led to believe   
do you think bloody bill's trying to get into her draws
too right    but he does not have a show nobody gets into mother's draws except daddy
do not worry gina mummy and daddy love each other
i need my sodding parents' consent
all right then
your mother is a rather miserable woman    is not she
i thought for hours about whether carmelita should accept bernard's marriage proposal   
i think she knows that is going to happen    she does not appear to bear us any grudge

yeah and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle
okay stay  we will come back for you
make up your mind

i talked you into this
i would have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber

get your reserve bottle and let's go
i think so  i am not sure are you
i am okay
god they are horrible  i hate them  did you see its eyes  how black they are  the look in them
do not think about it  it is over
it is never over  here comes another six years of bad dreams
i know i can capture it
kathryn you are crazy  really crazy  a suicidal maniac
i got it on sale  a real steel
should protect you a little from the compression  if that thing gets ahold of you
thank you
it is easier to lure sharks at night
why  'cause they are hungrier
no you are not
 me too
we will go to palm springs death valley arizona desert anyplace where there's no water
get some sleep  and tell sean i am sorry
sean that is right
recovering nicely
me too
you do not
it is my new perfume  great white the maneater
that is up
i need more pressure in the shark tank
sure  let's go
 mean through the tubes
yes  it is faster
no  i am not going through there
they are not going to hurt you they are encased in plastic
i do not want to see them kathryn
 he ought to put him in here
it is too soon to move him
so tell calvin
i did  he wants it on exhibit
well that is why you got it
i have to get out of here
come on
i cannot take water kathryn
yes you can
it is a shark's tooth
that is just it michael  we do not
what do you mean we do not
this tooth is from another shark a shark that could be 30 feet long
thirty feet
that is why they are always moving they have to have it
you wanted to know about a cave
it is all controlled from the control room
you two go  i will call calvin
couple of fractures lacerations they say he is gonna be all right
 i have to go honey  phillip and i are going down together to kill the shark
who's going to do it
i am  you are not
but you 
it is a construction job  i am the only one that can do it
i want that shark kathryn
you do not have to prove anything
only to myself
i am  fine
on the telly  we are to film him for the evening news
nobody told me
i just did  can you make them do tricks
they are not tricks  they are behavior patterns
fine  have them do some
i do not know  they are nervous and skittish right now
yes are not we all
make this quick
well then can you have them jump to the camera over here
wait a minute  these are not kangaroos mr hutton  they are dolphins
i thought they were clever
i can have them walk backwards
no no  that will not do
i told you something's upset them
sharks are manbiters mister hutton  not maneaters 
that is preposterous
i have handled sharks before bigger than this one
calvin let me go down there and kill the bastard
calvin i insist i be allowed to capture it
three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known
it is one of the world's greatest creatures

shark bait  draws them over for closeups
what in hell is that
we are taking that shark alive
let's hope he knows that
i know it and i will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that
afraid i cannot do that
you are supposed to film it not turn it to hash
still sleeping
kiss him maybe he will turn into a frog
should be coming out of it soon
just watch it when he does

it is all up to kathryn  amity's fine with me if it is fine with her
we are in love
yeah right  that is what you said about janet and beth and barbara 
puppy love  this time it is real we can have a double wedding
that bugger moves fast
give me a 400foot magazine  we may be down there for a while
i would not mind going down with her
she is a lovely bit of crumpet at that
absolutely  the audience will stain their drawers  i did
you have been hearing the sordid side then
up there
what is it really
yes  that is us
yes  we do
have you worked here long
no no no  quite a long time yes
what was the matter with it
you could say we represent the uunuofficial view of a wellordered society
you were his friend  one link is all they need
perhaps eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced
i do not know what you could have read
just what you have published
 in magazines nobody reads
i read the one about the penal colony
did you
the needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man  very good
 in what sense
naturally  that is not the word i would have chosen
success or nothing
a man must eat   and drink
the ucastleu cemetery
there is uoneu thing i would like you to tell me
i am trying to find things out myself  that is the whole point
what made you think ui wouldu be able to get you into the castle
an empty tomb
a cenotaph  a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere but look 
another one
it is my last and final one
then its authority is in doubt
a true friend would do it
not necessarily  a uwifeu would
i gave it to him yesterday
you did not give it to umeu
no i left it in his office
did you see him
i have never seen him  i do not believe there is a keeper of the files
but ui amu the messenger  an error like this damages my credibility
your credibility  yes it is well known
say what you like  no one pays the least attention
oh do not they  i think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own
it is what i am paid to do
you are detestable
and you are late
sit down kafka
you must make the time  where do you go off to in the lunch hour
i usually take lunch by the river
oh i know you got along with that poor fellow  what was his name
in a small way
you might find a more athletic hobby  put some color in your cheeks
i do
the uorlacu claim
sorry yes  well  thank you sir
i know
you are a friend of eduard rabangs
why would you suppose so
oh  well i thought he once mentioned 
one of you must be mistaken
excuse me i have to copy this for central docketing by 230
i have never seen you here before
have you looked
i suspected that he  well
this morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving
two or three months that is all   i seduced him
eduard did not see it as something that needed bearing
the police would know the difference would not they
do you think people in the new town care what happens over here  this will always be the ghetto
he was not robbed  he was identified by his wallet
and you believe everything the authorities tell you
when i have no reason to doubt
 all right
last year  i  it was broken off
eduard wanted to marry me
and you 
you will not have any trouble finding it
they are ubiquitous  what we try to do  is make them a little less so
i have hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from
what of it
he was murdered
i have no right to be i know  my experience with real life  is practically nil
when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day it is liable to create a false impression
people must think the same of me  a quiet dependable person
yes  which is why quiet dependable people have to take charge of their own lives
burgel gave me this  what does it mean
burgel  i did not leave it with him
why were you given notice
they are not obliged to tell
it could not be for that incident with burgel the other day
i would not put it past him
burgel does not like anybody
he used to like me  very much more than i liked him
he is jealous yes but uthatu jealous  he is too cautious
how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records
i have heard of it happening
and burgel is the bringer of messages is not he
i knew you walked this way to work  i wanted to find you before they did
 i have just come from the castle  it is over
i  i found your jailer
yes  yes of course  why would not it be
when was the last time you saw mr raban
wednesday  we left the office together
did you go anywhere afterwards  to have a drink perhaps
no we said goodbye outside the building  he went off as usual toward his house
your office is the workmengs 
 accident and compensation association
where you have been employed for seven years
eight  and seven months
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of  pills and so forth
well  other departments are yes
would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close
yes  since he came to the office almost three years ago we have been quite good friends  how was eduard 
he was found in the river  could he swim
i do not know
was he depressed
no  he did not seem to be  do you think he drowned himself
grown men do not normally fall into the river do they
no i suppose not
he might have had a drink or two despite what you think
can i ask  how you found me
his landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to
i do not think he really had any he had no family either
we know that
what makes you think so
 just a perception
 should you happen upon anything that might be relevant
she is missing  i went to her house and she had not returned there
what did she say
that the police may have allegiance to something other than truth
we saw her naked once  did not we
you mean because it is been a while since there was a sunny day  what a good detective you are
you mean you have actually begun some
i cannot make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
 you should meet my father
it is a farce
close only by virtue of antithesis
that is obvious is not it  we have an opening for a new member
 oh yes it is mad
then why have not i been 
i believe we have exceeded his expectations
lying in the gutter where they belong
it usually is
yes  is not it there
he is the clerk who died last week from the insurance department
orlac is an account
these laws have been with us for centuries  how can you doubt them
what if i petitioned one of the directors
we are a medical firm are not we they go to the medical records section
i could always apply there
you look tired
gabriela rossman was here looking for you  do you know her
she went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour  we watched her changing
we used to be in the supply section carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them
it is not too bad working here
and we are upset too
 how would uyouu like to be in a horrible situation like that
here too  they are all in a dreadful muddle
they would drive us away  that kafka's made things very hot for us
i understand he was wounded in the lung
it does not matter  it is too late for all of us
that is to become of us now
amerika for us
yeah  but he ai not here now
know where he is
follow me
look fellathis is private
nothing's private

straylight kitchen dock
skeleton key this opens the gates of babylon
a place to tap in i can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen
no just riviera trying to fuck with our heads they are close very close
an artificial intelligence a computer system that is developed the capacity for sentient thought they are dangerous and totally unpredictable
he is a vat grown ninja the royal family's bodyguard watch out for him he is no joke
they are only guessing but we cannot take any risks
why not
you get us access to the tessier's computer and you can return to earth anytime you want a free man
and how do you suggest i do that
you have got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason i would like to hear what it is
very well
sensenet's corporately financed too corrupt to be trusted you of all people should know that
what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage
i would say you were full of shit
who's running the show armitage this a government sting
questions make me nervous part of our arrangement will be that you do not ask too many
i do not call this fun pal you are playing god with my body
good because you have got a new one
the disturbance in cyberspace it is an ai
right and no one would take on an ai if they had a choice
it has not yet
dixie mccoy
right best cowboy that ever punched deck the old man taught me most of what i know
i have arranged for him to work with us
that is gonna be tough because dixie mccoy's dead the ai flatlined him
i know  you ever work with ghosts case
what are you talking about
then we rendezvous with the final member of our team for now that is all you need to know
it is just that sometimes i wonder what team i am playing on
i cannot tell a lie sorry
sorry bullshit we have not even begun and you are already jeopardising this operation
that is he doing to my gear
could be your ai's calling card
did you trace it
no but it traced me
what about mccoy
really do i get to know where i am going it makes packing so much easier
you will be linked during the entire operation
stick with her i want the process to become second nature to you we fly for freeside at dawn
you see the couple up in the balcony
he is a sensenet chairman why would he launch an ai
we will not have to the run is tomorrow night
then once she is in you can guide her straight to the mainframe
as long as you cooperate  i want it now armitage
what are you talking about
the antitoxin i am not waiting until this is over give it to me now or there's no run
this ai not bangkok chief
i find out now
i prefer distrusting you it will keep us honest
honesty almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil
can you read my mind
my problem mr case is simply that i am a soulless bastard
the words
the access code to your mainframe
patience mr case only one hour and thirtyeight minutes to enlightenment
fine ratz thanks
i do not have a girl
no girl only biz my dear artiste
alwaysby the way you know that girlfriend you do not have
it is case remember me
fine dixie fine
last i heard you cracked sukura international i could not believe it
yeah that was me
jesus christ kid nobody's ever cracked sukura
as far as they know that is absolutely true
ya learned good so that is happening
that is a good question that is the last thing you remember
dixie you know how a rom construct works
sure kid it is a firmware construct
okay dix you _are_ a rom construct
founders of zion builders of freeside
all things possible in babylon
help me send this wintermute motherfucker straight down into it
i ang i man i ang i
this place empty as a tomb mon
the girl 3jane we need her
can you walk
do not know mon this is a jumpship not meant for transport
we are dead men if we go back there maelcom they will hunt us down
jah guides us
maybe so
you are dixie mccoy's construct that makes you something special
i need its matrix coordinates dixie i have got to nail that thing where it lives
who got you into this
a guy who calls himself armitage
never heard of him
nobody has
no problem amigo
what about the ai dix sensenet has not even been able to trace it
that ai of your's got the whole matrix humming sticks out like a spider in a web
can you take me to it
not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying
that is pretty good cause he is only working with one lobe
it is possible the guy was a blank slate
no it is gotta be more than that that hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart too powerful

that is the spirit
no josie this is real
and a gymnast
she is sixteen years old rob that is totally and completely illegal
thanks and what are 
duh tom cruise risky business
i know
sorry forgetful
you like her
i love the way she writes
not the happiest of souls  art is a form of catharsis and love is a permanent flop
sure why
because seventeenyearolds do not like writers from the '30's they do not even like people in their 30's
well i am definitely seventeen and  now definitely late
oh i do not think so
your writing it is amazing josie you are really talented and far less depressing than dorothy parker
thank you
so what are you thinking for college
college have not really thought about it
that is crazy i will get you some applications
thanks wow that isreally nice to hear
thank you
actually it is more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me
oh right the spiderman incident
you remember that story
of course i remember everything from your class
that is what makes you interesting  as a teacher
you have to say that you are my student
i do not have to say that
i should not say that because i am your teacher
when are you going to open your eyes
i am thinking when i am home
thanks  they were not related to humpty dumpty were they tweedle dum and tweedle dee
maybe distant cousins they did have that egg shape in common

do you think you will find her
yeah actually i do
what buti was not even going to go to college
wow you believe in me that much
thanks so do you
well are you here with anybody
no i am alone
it is weird because prom is actually from the word promenade and you cannot really promenade alone can you
yeah i have
no surprise i thought you would be
what happy why because it turns out all along that i was allowed to be attracted to you
you were attracted to me
you set me up for a story  you know that is crazy i was actually considering waiting for you
but now you do not have to
i just cannot look at you the same way
i finally found my story
the poem i knew he liked the poem  billy prince is asking me to the prom
that is what i am saying
i know like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid

it is really hard to do some kids try for all ofhigh school and never make it
we are very evolved

you so do not deserve to be prom queen
i am handing out a free lei to every customer what do you think
i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches
relax monty it is just my sister
thank you  i am rob

if simms catches you in here after lights out she will chew my ass ragged
i gotta stay up max
deal  thanks
do not fucking humor us  we are not in the mood
he wears a dirty brown hat  he is horribly burned  he has razors on his right hand
last time it was me against him  i was not strong enoughalone
no fucking way  we are a team
you are hot stit with a little mute kid  let's see you take a piece of me  krueger
he is close
i think new york was just what i needed  so many people  i never feel alone
the city that never sleeps  so what will you do now
i do not know  i am busy with school new friends  but i will never forget the old ones
to old friends  and your new dreams
to old friends
do you stillsee each other
yes  i am going to see her tonight
i  i think so
he is real
i was on the team at school  i was never very good though
we are not always as good at things as we would like
yeah but i was really not good
you did it the other night
that was different
you never lose a gift like that  you just forget how to use it  how about it  will you try
how do we find him kristen
i do not know
they sedated me  we are stuck here till it wears off
let's try this way
i think so
i am so proud of you all  tell neil i
cannot be good news coming from you
pulled night duty  trimble's sick
i do not do that shit
those are ancient history
oh yeah  well if you are ever in the mood for a history lesson i am your teacher understand
stay out of my face or i will go straight to max
now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you
fuck off
a little basic but nice
i will have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow  the patient's rooms are down here
why is that
she is been waiting outside your office since breakfast
i just wanted to be here for the kids how are they
restless  very restless
thanks max
it will be my last chance  pleese
thank you
say listen doc  i got a new theory about all these suicides
do not hold back on us max  we need all the help we can get
fucked up chromosomes man  think about it  their parents all dropped acid in the sixties
it beats dr simm's theory  she thinks it is nothing but sex drugs and rock & roll
shit that is what keeps people alive
it is been a long time
you know what he did  he is doing it again
but i could not go until i told you how sorry i am for all the things i have done
you will get to meet them all tomorrow they aresurvivors  in a way  all severely sleep disordered  insomnia narcolepsy bedwetting
but nightmares are the common thread
that is that supposed to mean
so i have been told  practically an obsession of your
call it a passion  i have got to get going
make sure to check in with max he will give you the 25 cent tour
call me nancy
only if you call me neil  what was that nursery rhyme all about
just something children singto keep the boogeyman away
did not get much sleep
well we have got 
never been here before
must have opened while i was away at school
most authentic mexican food in springwood which is not saying much  your parents still live around here
my mother's dead  died in her sleep
sounds like a rough time
it was  neil do you believe in other realities
i have been to pittsburgh  does that count
i am serious
that is a new one  is that what they are teaching now at stanford
that is what i know
the nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems
all right  then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being
with hypnocyl
that is right
you want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers
just until we get things under control
dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with  you have no business taking it yourself
i used to be like them neil  i know what they are going through
so do i
do you  you told me they are survivorsand they are  but how much longer they survive is up to us
i am sorry nancy  the answer is no
do you think we can get the hypnocyl in by tomorrow
we are gonna try
does not matter
c'mon  let's get out of this rain
for what
the truth
try me
only if you are willing to put aside everything you have learned and trust me can you do that
i can do that
remember  open mind
okay we are going to try a little group hypnosis
everybody take five
there's nothing we can do  it is out of our hands
bullshit  getting yourself killed will not do the kids any good  besides we do have a choice
assuming your mysterious nun in right
i have heard crazier things this week
all right  whoever she is i will admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do
the question is what happened to freddy's body
they burned him to death in his boiler room but they were smart enough to hide the remains
who would know where they were hidden
there's only one manand its time for him to talk
just go  kristen needs you  keep her awake somehow  do it
hey everybody has bad dreams
sshhh  no time for that  come on
what about kristen
we cannot get to her  i have tried
and what are they
the byproduct of guilt  psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality
you cannot  they will be defenseless against their dreams
that is precisely what they need  some uninterrupted rem sleep to release all this negative energy
neil please 
they used to keep a spare key
what are you talking about
you are about to attend a funeral  one that is long overdue
no  we are alone
a sad choice
there are times when it does not offer much comfort  i have seen you before  sister
mary helena
you do volunteer work at the hospital
i come from time to time  when i am needed
that girl was amanda krueger  her child 
you must find the remainsand bury them in hallowed ground
cooling down
if he continues having these outbursts i will have to have him isolated permanently
do not worry it will not come to that
frankly i do not understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro
she is been doing groundbreaking research on pattern nightmares
i know what it is  i just cannot believe what i am hearing  what has she talked you into
nothing  they are my patients  it is my decision  i want the dreams stopped until we get some answers
i will not allow it
i will go straight to carver if i have to  he will either back me up or accept my resignation
for god's sake elizabethjust try to help the kids will you  listen to them
of course
accident my ass  i thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here
uh fourteen
does not count  you gotta say the words
this is stupid
good  you conquer the demon but your horse is sinking in the bog  what do you do
i go to bed and get a new horse in the morning

but you know what i am talking about do not you  about glenn do not you and the second car
i know a glenn
you mean did he try to jump me  no but he was kind of talkative
he gets that way when he is nervous sometimes
he did not want me to
why not
he would call every once in a while
he called the day he escaped
he did  i do not remember  did he say about me  in the trunk
he said he wished the two of you could start over live a normal life
huh  problem is jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks  it is all he is ever done

i was not feeling my best that day i would just drawn thirty to life
maybe this will make you feel better
say anything in there about karen sisco
just that she got away

you will have to ask glenn  and most likely he is on his way to detroit where we should be
am i going to detroit by myself
he is running for his life he does not give a shit about you
her phone's probably tapped
and you know they are gonna have some people watching the hotel
i am a tourist
you at least bring the gun
in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel  that is her place
sure looks that way
let's go to detroit
now you are talking
well first off if you were glenn you would not be thinking
remember snoopy miller his old pal from lompoc
snoopy  christ i thought he would be brain dead by now
i think glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner
or two
that is he do now tell fortunes
they do not stay the night jack 'less you pay for it
you tell your sister about it
just hung up
how long you talk to her
two hours
how long were you with the girl
fortyfive minutes
you did not tell your sister about ripley did you  'cause i do not wanna go through that again
jesus look at that wall  place almost looks like a prison
no doubt the mangs got some bigass security system
they put a gun on you you still have a choice do not you
i saw karen sisco
yes she did
so how is that work a wanted felon socializing with a us marshal
you know how i felt about her
did you give her a jump  if you did i might begin to understand where your head's at
it was not about getting laid  i just wanted to know what might have happened if things were different
you find out
yeah i did
whatta you wanna do
i get that feeling yeah
but you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do
getting me out of glades for starters
and who watches your back

obiwan once thought as you do

if that is your destiny
search your feelings father you cannot do this i feel the conflict within you let go of your hate
i will not fight you father
there is no conflict
you could not bring yourself to kill me before and i do not believe you will destroy me now
you underestimate the power of the dark side if you will not fight then you will meet your destiny
i will not fight you
no more training do you require already know you that which you need
your father he is
unfortunate that i know the truth
i am seethreepio humancy

how many languages do you speak
i am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily
splendid we have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him

twenty years ago i woulda said not a chance but these kids today damn if i know
we have not located her dad yet
keeping my eye on sidney

have you contacted the bureau
he would have to be crazy where is sidney
she is with my sister should i bring her in
hold off for now just stay close to her
she will be with her friends over at stu maker's tonight

not my daughter not my
jesus the camerahurry
you want to go live
when did that ever stop you you cannot sit on this this is huge
if i am gonna blow this up  i need hard proof
but it is so much easier when we make it up
not this time i owe cotton that much hell even i thought that man was guilty
prep the compact we will hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities
that is the delay
about thirty seconds
as long as it records i do not give a shit we are not doing a remote
yes that is right
it will be out later this year
i will send you a copy
just stay back
i want to talk to you
kenny camera now
forget it
i owe you shit
your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case somebody was gonna write a book about it
and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories
during the trial you did all those stories about me you called me a liar
i think you falsely identified him yes
have you talked to cotton
many times
has his story changed
not one word he admits to having sex with your mother but that is all
i saw him leaving wearing it
why would she lie about it
for attention the girl has some serious issues
and why would she do that
maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage
maybe she is a slut just like her mom
please it is common knowledge her mother was a trollop
ricki lake
do you like scary movies sidney
i like that thing you are doing with your voice randy it is sexy
that is your favorite scary movie
do not start you know i do not watch that shit
and why is that
that is so unoriginal you disappoint me randy
maybe that is because i am not randy
so who are you
the question is not who am i the question is where am i
so where are you
your front porch
that is the original part
right here
if you hang up you will die just like your mother
who are you
can you knock
i heard screaming
no you did not
so call if you need me
got it
sleep tight sweetie
oooooh before or after he sliced and diced
fuck you nut case where were you last night
working thank you
i thought blockbuster fired you
she is the scream queen
do not shoot it is me
do not come any closer
listen to me sid i found tatum she is dead she is been killed i think stu did it
you got it
yeah casey and steve were completely hollowed out takes a man to do something like that
before she dumped him for steve
what are you saying that i killed her or something
it would certainly improve your high school q
i am gonna gut your ass in a second
did you really put her liver in the mailbox i hear they found her liver in the mailbox
we had a run in the mass murder section
you coming tonight
yeah i am off early  curfew you know  now that is poor taste
it was all a misunderstanding he did not do anything
you are such a little lap dog he is got killer printed all over his forehead
the why would the police let him go
because obviously they do not watch enough movies this is standard horror movie stuff prom night revisited
maybe sidney would not have sex with him
she is saving herself for you

conan o'brien whoa what are you doing here
i am looking for a lastminute guest for my show any suggestions
i will be your guest
really well all right let's take a look at the television and see how we look
thank you
nice to have you here
great to be here
ahhtell me what do you want to do for me that is your idea
be your sidekick you know and maybe eventually become a tv talk show host
do you have any brothers or sisters
four brothers and five sisters
but do you really believe in god and heaven hell and angels and all kind of stuff
were not there high schools in el salvador
we had to work my family was poor
must have been hard being poor
i am still poor
hmmm  but consuelo even though your poor do not you have any hobbies or interests or anything
no mikey
but like what do you like to do when you are not working
i am always working
but when you are not like now what do you like to do
this is work
but it is not like real work this is just babysitting
mi jesusmi jesus
speak english
mi jesus esta muerto
consuelo i am sorry but you know if you do not speak english i cannot understand you
my jesus
who is jesus
my baby
you have a bay
my grandchildbaby
gee i did not even know you had any children but why are you so upset about jesus
he is dead
oh how did it happen
he was executed he was on death row and then he was executed
how did they execute him
poison gas
maybe he was and you just did not know it
he was not
but still you cannot be sure
i am sure
but really you never know
i know
why was he on death row
for rape and murder
it is when you love someone and they do not love you and then you do something about it
well then when you get older you can do something about it
yes i do i love them
thanks i will tell mike  well it is still just a beginning i know i candig deeper
you think so you do not think that this might not be a little dry
i mean without this footage without this rigorous documentation it would feel like exploitation
i mean why are you making this documentary if you cannot treat your subject with appropriate gravity
we are not ready
hip alternative types who will understand the process better
we are not ready
well i need to see this with an audience
that is an audience going to tell you
i do not know maybe they will like it
i am serious what happens if he blows up the school
got a lot of homework
do not worry he does not mean money
you know you have to sometimes you just have to toby
look we are not suckers everyone else is out there doing the same thing
he is right
is everything ok
i dunno
how was the class
that is tomorrow
the sats knucklehead scooby i am not taking them
you mean again
well i changed the ending a little
oh what happens now
well actually it is the same but longer i think it is better moreraw
well then maybe you should just read the ending
but it will not make any sense if you hear it out of context
i think you should leave it the way it was it was good
marcus i am tired that is all
you have lost interestyou hardly even sweat any more when we have sex
i was never much of a sweater you know that
do not be so upset it is ok
what the fuck are you talking about that is ok
you know he hated my story also
your story was terrible
well i sure did not hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered
you are absolutely right the focus is on the college admissions process today
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds
oh well i do not have them yet but 
i have a cousin very big giver to the alumni fund
whaddya mean you do not know you either got a lot or you do not that is not to know
the same
the same same as what
just the same
man it is just like conversation
yeah well mikey listen up cause here's a lesson life's not fair
one in a million recover
maybe he is that one in a million
mikey there's optimism and then there's stupidity it is a very fine line
yeah sure go ahead hypnotize me
ok stay there i will be right back

oh clark you are so delightfully primitive
this is metropolis after hours this is what you will be writing about c'mon let's dance
actually i had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom
what about here
well my career takes up a lot of my time
do not tell me you are waiting for lightning to strike wideeyed romantics are an endangered species
that sounds kind of pessimistic
no realistic there's no magic in the world girls just do not get swept off their feet anymore
do not worry i have got you
if you say so here goes
yes i know i am sure it will be a great story
i will just invite them both to my hotel suite and we will have high tea it is very chic
come early the view is so romantic from my balcony
   let me get my purse
oh    right   i will be back in a flash
let's sit down they walk to the table lois calls out to the balcony
no mind it is only antique irish linen
any more like you back home clark
like me
that tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids
au contraire mon ami he owns all those sleazy tabloids and the daily planet
i do not think we are being treated fairly lois and i am going to tell miss warfield
clark    wait
you always overreact clark how terrible can it be
i do not think 'fan mail' fits this letter  read it clark
clark it is lois this is the fourth message i have left   where are you 
because i made a vow never to interfere in the destiny of your planet
but what good is a vow if everything gets blown away  what good was my letter
i am sorry
nnoi meanyou bet
i will try  
go on   
clark kent you socialized with him    a    reporter
oh    no    i mean we just went  dancing    for  a story   
did not we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help now that you are the publisher   
stuff it
i would just like to have a little less sensationalism
less sensational papers go broke i thought i taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business
one hundred percent  and i like him that way
   and  very nave
superman gets mail here
an angle
right    you want to tell him how you feel   
but he is never there
why lois i did not know    who is he
something    wonderful
our other dinner guest
he was getting on    and then this man with luggage and     oh it is a long story
it always is with clark
a toupee that flies
   i look at you lenny and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate
but why the hair
quiet you will make him selfconscious
i must have miscalculated how  
get the box nephew
oh leonard    when i sent the remains of my last experiment   
the one superman wrecked up
he is     beautiful perfect
you are just an experiment freako
did not you see it he lifted me up and crashed me down
hmm    nuclear levitation now that is a trick that could come in handy
good let's hope he stays that way
my nephew leonard he worships me  let's share a toast to you    a nice guy who's about to finish last
this was not in the plan
i think he has his own plan uncle lex
ready uncle lex
for dignity my reputation is at stake just put it on
what a genius    an inspiration
you are    nothing i am father now
i made you and i can destroy you
wait not yet back
first i have fun
i am master now
luthor i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you would be far away from here by now
why because i want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block
no no listen i escaped with only one thing on my mind    the end of superman
nobody wants war i would just like to keep the threat alive
still having delusions lex luthor
right good tell you what we will wait right here till you get back
no    it is the way it always is    on the brink    with good fighting evil
it better be good
i am sorry sir  you okay
someone broke into this room
anything missing
does not look like it  we are damned lucky  this statue is priceless
why not
no one broke into this room sir someone broke out  that lock was torn off from the uinsideu
i appreciate that
it is too late now  guests are arriving  the mayor's car is pulling up
i will go down and speak to him
you have not got the authority  only pendergast can pull the plug
get his gun and his walkie talkie jonathan  move
do they have to wear uniforms
where is the walkin safe
behind you
that is the combination
i will do it  just let me find my portable phone
calm down  i found it
let's go
just a minute  i am shaking  take the gun
to the left twice then five no sorry i think it is fifteen it is been a while
oh jesus
eight to the right  look  i found it
what doors
i told you  they seal off all the cells  they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure 
you said the system could not fail
like hell
where the hell are you
i made it outside  i will coordinate the rescue efforts from here  help is on the way  just sit tight
special agent pendergast  fbi
vince d'agosta  am i out
not at all  i think we may be working on the same case  if so i could use your help
that is left of it
mind if i have a look
where is the head
whose footprints
in this violent world i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things
i drink  after hours of course  on duty i smoke  do you mind
not at all  i enjoy the smell of a good cigar
then you will not like this one  it is a piece of shit
no  there's more  there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat
you are kidding
unfortunately no
how do you explain the part about beauregard
they heard the victim's name and wove him into their story  nice touch
i believed them
if you do not mind a suggestion you might try a saliva test
apparently it is huge
i think i should come with you
we have not got time  you have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight
this door's locked  try shooting the hinges off
i have been down there  it links up to the old sewer system  i can guide you out
go out the north exit  there's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases  run
everybody  get behind me
the subbasement huh  great idea
i am one of the few who know every inch it now that john is gone
may i see that
pardon my french but bull shit
this on top of the scratches is not it proof
what is it
dr green has to see you
got my hands full here
it is important  please  you have to come  pendergast too  she is found out something
there's a dead body in the exhibit people are panicking trampling each other trying to get out
i know
you are asking me  i do not even know how to load this thing
oh shit
not so loud
all right everybody hold up
dr john whittlesley
that is that doing here
i do not know  i thought dr whittlesley died in south america
i would say we are in its home
oh yes  who could forget  afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte
i hope you liked it
someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa
right  the entire brain appears to have been extracted  may i see it please
the thalamus and the hypothalamus perhaps
yes  two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision
let me help  i can take care of everything
yes it is  i am tired and i am no longer needed 
my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you
i am not giving up
you must
you are this museum  it will not be the same without you
everyone needs a change of scenery i have been rolling down these halls for fortyodd years  that is quite enough
let me see the plant press
you are right
what are they
they are eggs
let's not jump to conclusions  this egg could belong to any number of reptiles dr frock
that is not so unusual  many plants carry viruses  like the burls on maple trees
margo what you have just described is a killing machine
some kind of power failure  maybe it is the storm  do you have a flashlight
i think so
do not stop now
it is one of the fire doors  good lord margo  we are trapped
no dr frock  you cannot
we will
look who's here margo
yes  john made quite a study of the whole museum  he had a copy of my original plans
and failed  these doors are solid steel
this means there must be an animal loose in the museum
i would not be so sure
not really  just the subbasement
i do not know  it was walled over  no one's been down there in years
you said you had plans of the museum  could we see them please
i do not believe it
they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta
yes i do
what do you do
i am an evolutionary biologist  what do you do
nothing  i am in third grade  that is a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit
evolutionary biologist  i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years
way cool  then you know where the dinosaurs are
fourth floor west wing but stay with your class
she is never going to take us to see the dinosaurs  that lady said they were on the fourth floor
let's ditch and find them ourselves
chicken  this is a great short cut
do not be a wuss  come on
i do not know  but i think it is bad
big as a house
not that big
well almost  depends which house  it smelled like old hamburger and it made this weird noise
like this
they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's
they were yellow
you are color blind
the dogs have lost the scent mr pendergast  maybe we should head back
not yet  let's try the fork to the left
keep the light up  i cannot see
heel argo  hobbes  heel
get back  now
he is right  follow me
come on  let's get back to the others  we cannot leave them alone
another storage room
keep the animal quiet
it is not mammalian that is for sure i think it is reptilian
lizard dna and human dna on the same strand  impossible  the sample must be contaminated
there's another possibility  a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage
it is reptilian
what kind of hormones
try weinsteings tropic hormone
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains
eats them
yes he is fine  greg take care of yourself
how about lunch
not today  besides i think the director of the museum is expecting you
maybe not
if he were alive he would have contacted me
you have time to talk
disappeared  his body was not among the victims
i do not understand
how did you know that
you were afraid of him were not you
a legendary monster called mbwun
a monster
no one knows  the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals
i do not understand
something came up in autopsy tonight  imbedded in beauregard's body we found a claw
my god  then it was an animal
i do not think so  i think we were meant to think it was mbwun  did whittlesley's monster have claws
i am not sure  we should split up you take that hall and i will take this one
all right  i am as macho as you are perhaps
i do not know
i heard you calling and i ran after you but you kept disappearing and i could not keep up
you were behind me  running after me
behind me  over there
all right  if you are positive
i did not imagine it  i know what i saw  are you sure there are enough men in there
they are all heavily armed
i do not know  mr pendergast  do me a favor  get me a dna readout on that claw
no  i think i am hallucinating
the planetarium
no  the planetarium is in the next cell  this is one of the fire doors
what are you going to do
it is scared of me
i think it means it is full
then it will not go after the others
no  it is still hunting but not for the hormones
for what
i think for the pleasure of the kill
oh god  help
it is coming  run
i have to shoot
do it quickly  please  aim for the eye
i cannot
you have to  do it now
i want to book a flight to fiji
where exactly
i am sorry erthe biggest one
viti levu  for how many
ia monthi
it is the busy season
you are a travel agent are not you  doris  your job is to help people travel
i thought you were in a hurry
that is right
you want to book the flight
it does not matter  i will make other arrangements
no hold back
he moved down there after meryl packed up and left
why was not i told  any unpredictable behavior has to be reported  is that the best shot we can get
that is to see
that is on the clockcam
he gave it back to his father
all prop cars accounted for
he has to be on foot  he has the world's most recognizable face  he cannot disappear
what have we missed
it is just a matter of time
why would we
sweep the harbor
what music
istormi musicwagner
do it
how idoi you intend to explain his twenty two year absence
i prefer to think of it as a mirror
but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps
certainly a nomination
of course truman has always been very much in on casting
let me demonstrate some examples
of course his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected
and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country
people forget it takes the ipopulationi of an entire country to keep the show running
there's nothing on the show i do not use myself
and it is all available in the truman show catalogue  operators are standing by
i am the creator
a show  that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions
ia showi  then who am i
you are the star
iyoui were real  that is what made you you so good to watch
they removed all physical trace of her but they could not erase the memory
the memory of who
because his mother got sick  very sick  he could not leave her  he is a kind boy maybe too kind
i cannot believe he married meryl on the rebound
it is not gonna be his you idiot
why not
you think she would go through with it
sure she would
guess i always thought they would adopt
oh yes
lauren right
that is right  lauren
i am truman truman burbank
i am not allowed to talk to you
i am sorry  it is not up to me
you have a boyfriend  of course you do
no  really  good i mean i thought possibly a pizza  how about friday

they are  perfect  thank you
gee that is great
a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw  we got three of his fingers back on

that can wait  i want to get away  see some of the world  explore

because i never have  that is why you go places is not it
truman i think i am going to throw up
you blaming me for the traffic
should i
there's been an accident truman
uhuh  there's no accident  it is just more stalling
i bet you did
i am sure they are just exaggerating
i have got my seahaven bankcard

the hebrew hammer you are alive

no it was the perfect level
no i am airsick you asshole where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly
i do not know why do not you ask them sir
what are we gonna do he is got us on the ropes
maybe he ran out of ammo
take a look
it is friday
this road it leads straight to kuwait
turn the car around
please i beg of you  the american army is there  i am iraqi  they will kill me
nobody's going to hurt you
not up to us  up to the iraqis  all they have to do is get out of kuwait
help i am being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory
there you go jaeger  just find the buried treasure and you are a millionaire
damn this is sweet  we are going to be home in no time
better grab up some sand to take home to your family
oh god
no please not again
we are going to keep driving
we should not have been here epps  there is a war going on
this is miles from the battle lines they were probably deserters
deserters would have run they would not have engaged
they should not have been out this way that is all i am saying
low on gas  got to refill
him getting us stranded out here does not do much good either
he is not so
he is an idiot and he is not nearly as hard as he thinks
i do not know and i was not about to mess with it
should have blown already  delayed fuse that is vietnam stuff
for climbing
break it out
the soldiers are going to kill those people
there's nothing we can do  we should not even be here in the first place
let me see the map
what do you figure it to be
got to be some kind of landmark something distinctive
basically  but the map has been pretty precise so far  i do not think it will be too hard to
i do not know  there's a lot of space up here  they could be just about
weird they did not chase us
so we wait
all right  i will go up then you send up the gold and
what about it
maybe we should split it up now
we started this together and we are staying together so there's no point in splitting things up now
what if we get separated  way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share
you have had your say wes  now leave it
maybe you have got ideas of your own for the gold  maybe you have already got things worked out
maybe i do
maybe i do not need your ideas  maybe i can do better on my own
then get up and do something about it
i told you  he tried to steal our gold he tried to kill us
i told you do not push me around
how is he going to want the gold  he could not even know we had it
hehe could have been watching us
you said he was a deserter
that is what he says  he could be a spy or something
you do not know that
you do not know he is not
he is an enemy soldier
i am not going to let you kill him
we are at war
he tried to kill us  if not just now then in the helicopter  that is all the authority i need
it is a combat action
it is murder and i will not be any part of it
then step aside
i out rank you that is why
lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge
and let me guess who is
suppose i do not go for that
then i suppose it would be insurrection and i suppose i would have to kill you  i suppose
what about jaeger
nothing about him unless he is got a problem about me dealing with you
tell me something wes  are you crazy greedy or just stupid  jaeger says you are crazy
that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert
you do not know john epps very well do you
i have to answer him
so you can give us away
if i do not answer he will know something's up
if i give it to you will you let us go
what are you doing
what does it look like i am doing  i am killing iraqis  atatatatat  atat atat
do not get pissed at me just 'cause i want to be ready when this war starts
ready for what  what are you supposed to be doing
i told you i am shooting iraqis
no you are not
another month in this desert and i might just
blow me  have i said that to you guys recently  blow me
there might be something in there
yeah the deed to the brooklyn bridge
there might be
oh my god
i did it  i got the box open
i would like to go home alive with a couple of iraqi scalps hanging from my belt
wait  wait
christ  wes tell him  you know this stuff
we disappear for awhile  we disappear we came back nobody knows nothing
but we all got to be in for this  we all go or we do nothing
we go we get rich we go home  it is that easy
roger that
cool it jaeger  hey wes  wes
you know what i am doing with my part of the gold
what are you going to do with your uthirdu
invest it
oh that is fun
you know you sound just like a boy who's never
whwhat do you think
take the goddamn binoculars

yeah  i know  i am with you
do not drink up all of yours 'cause you are not getting any of ours
i am just going to have a little sip that is all  just a sip
i heard it click

i heard it
just be cool
it is a mine is not it
just relax
how'm i gonna relax standing on a mine
we are going to get off all right  we will get you off of there  justbe cool
me and wes are just going to talk
why you got to move away to talk
we are going to be right over here
you are moving away because it is going to blow up is not it  it is going to blow up
i said be cool all right  now be cool
epps my leg is falling asleep
it is not falling asleep  you have only been standing there for three minutes
i am the one who can feel my leg and it is falling asleep
it falls asleep and you die so wake it the hell up
you are not going to let me die are you do not let me die
do not let me die epps  i do not want to die
if we step on a mine we will know it was let me see the maps
it is the treasure that is what it is
just figure it is my map i ought to hang on to it
shut up and listen
it is a fire fight
single shots does not mean a fire fight that is not a battle going on
what are they doing here
the shi'ites are on our side  i did not know that
so good bye shi'ites  thanks for playing  we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go
something like that
but the white dot in the middle that is got to mean something
i hope it means something otherwise
stay low
where the hell is it
just stay down
we are not going to do anything
they are going to kill us
they cannot shoot us in here
if they land we can take them  if they do not land then we have got nothing to worry about
right now i would not be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns
so where do we start
what does it look like i am doing
it looks like you are not doing anything
i am not  and i am not doing anything because there's nothing down here
get up and dig
it is giving
is it dead
yeah bwana you got it
i would not know  i never imagined this not in my whole life did i ever imagine this
he is not going to leave us
that is to stop him if he wanted to  all he has to do is cut the line
jesus jaeger
i do not see how that plangs any better
someone's got to send the gold up  it cannot get on the line by itself
yeah  yeah that will work
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line  it did not seem that long
not when you are up here with the gold i guess not
it stays as it is  we are halfway home now  let's not blow it by people getting ideas
northeast  that is away from the hummer further into iraqi
we will find our way
forget wes
we cannot just leave him
wes is dead
what if he is not
they will ask questions want to know why we were out here
we will lie
they will search the pack
i am not like wes  wes was crazy
and you you have got it all together
is it all right if i stand up
yeah  well me too
i never killed anybody before  i talk a good game but i am not like that
what  yeah
makes two of us
i know what i did just now was crazy but you got to understand how much i want that gold
it is all right  i do not like it but it is over now
it is got to be going better than this
you sure you want me too
okay  then we go this way
it is a desert  that is what deserts do at night they get cold
eppsepps  i am gonna stop for a second
we have got to keep moving while there's still light
i just want to look at it  remind me of what i am dying for
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here
yeah but we made that deal while wes was still alive  he is gone  time for a new deal
place all alone like that  must be a boarder check point
which boarder  saudi  kuwait  syria
could not be syria  we could not have gone that far north  it is got to be saudi come on
epps  what if they are not saudi
yeah i guess we should
i do not know  something wes had taught me  i think it means do not shoot we are your friends
they must be saudis  it is a saudi checkpoint  oh sweet jesus  come on come on
they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them  they could not tell in the dark
what are we going to do
and then what
and then shoot them
ii never killed anyone before  i told you that
well you are going to start with a bang 'cause you have got four of them to take down
i do not have a weapon
i just said i would  i do not think i
shoot them
we keep going that is what we do  we ignore them maybe they ignore us
shi'ites i think
is that good or bad
i do not know  they killed wes
why have not they killed us
i do not know
maybemaybe we can fight our way out
with what  against how many
we cannot just sit here waiting to die
you come up with a better plan let me know
me  i say you do not have enough brains to be stupid
no but i figure now's a real good time to start
we go this way
thethe gold
it was not the gold  it was the claymore mine  the gold's in my pack
when did you make the switch
you should not think about things like that  it will just make you crazy
how do we do that
somebody has to
yeah but why me  what if the car does not stop
then i am a rich man
thought you were going to buy a car
still am  there's more gold than i thought and since there's only two of us now  where should i go
i do not know
i have never been anywhere  i would not know where to go  where would you go
how the hell should i know
we will make up some kind of lie  they will not find the gold
he will slow down
he is going to slow down
i am looking for a favor  i need a map of iraqi
i could use some recon photos too
justwant to be ready when we do
ready for what  sightseeing
the photos
they are all good ones  satellites we have got can snap a shot of the boil on saddam's ass
saddam's got a boil on his ass
a headache
yeah a headache  my head hurts  you are making me uncomfortable
people were suffering in afganistan and we did not do anything
i am saying do not do it accidently
oh yeah  accidently
it was an accident  you saw it was an accident
i am just trying to help you guys out  it does not hurt to know something about saudi arabia
i thought it would be good to know
do not shoot me i am friendly  you can use that when you surrender
how do you say come here baby  i am horny  i can use that now
do not even try it  you offend a woman out here you are in serious trouble
now you need me
what is it  you know so much about arabland tell me what it is
yeah you are funny
i could
naw nothing

i will show epps  he will be sorry when i get this thing open
you really think there's a treasure inside
yeah  so
that is in two days
like i said so
they are cancelling all leaves all passes  no more drills  we stand at full ready starting
that is your point wes  you have a point
why would they do all that if we were not
come on man  i almost had this thing open
you ever think about it  you ever worry
you know what wes  if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war
it is a container  break the seal
those soldiers have got loafers on  what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers
it is right here  this region annagaf i got recon photos  there are no troops there no fighting
you know it is real  you know it is real and you know it is there  you know it
hell we will just buy our way out
oh no
if  if there's a treasure
yeah  if  whatever  what kind you figure it is
i do not know  it would be small easy to transport and hide  gold or jewels probably gold
yeah  gold  how much
how the hell should i know how much
you know what i am doing with my half
two vehicles  they are not supposed to be here
oh jesus
they are noti had the pictures they are not supposed to be here

i know you are a pussy  i know that
funny you should say that while we are out looking for gold
you are the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad
we make it or we go back empty handed
just seems weird they did not chase us
lines up with the map and the photos
guess we know what the next stop is
yeah we are down

i think we found something
he is a soldier  he does not need a weapon  he is got rocks  he is got bare hands
he lived through that
all last night he could have been
i think he wants something to drink
i am not wasting my water on him
you want to say some words

well of course it is always dangerous 
i know that answer  if we went to trial would we win
how did you settle on the amount
we thought it was just
you thought it was just
yes  it would be
and no one will know the truth
what is the truth
mickey told me to come back to work
 yes  get her on the phone 
 that was a dr david gruber's office 
it looks that way
you know what that would mean  to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he will testify
 a mrs doneghy called  i told you that
frank galvings  who's calling please  bishop brophy's office 
what does it mean
they want to settle    it means a lot of money
does that mean i am back for awhile
do not equivocate  be positive just tell the truth
i was her doctor
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth nineteen seventy
i was one of a group of
when she
dr towler who was in the operating room with you
ms nevins nurseanesthetist drmarx of course
what did these people do when her heart stopped
we went to code blue
code blue' what does that mean
well many reasons actually
tell me one
she would aspirated vomitus into her mask
she threw up in her mask  let's cut the bullshit  say it  she threw up in her mask
that is right
and what did your team do
well we
you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear  is not that what you did
we did everything we could
to save her and to save the baby  is that
my god we tried to save heryou cannot knowyou cannot know
tell us
frank galvin  we have met before
to get her heartbeat back
we have touched on this his own witness has said
almost nine minutes  causing brain damage
your honor  your honor
that is correct  i was engaged to render an opinion
engaged to render an opinion  for a price  is that correct  you are being paid to be here today
just as you are sir
are you boardcertified in anesthesiology doctor
no i am not  it is quite common in new york state
i am sure it is but this is massachusetts doctor  certified in internal medicine

i would not do it
you would not
they lied'  indeed  when did they lie  and do you know what a lie is
i do  yes
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago
that is not my handwriting
you have just said you signed it
yes i yes i signed it yes but i i did not write that figure
you did not write that figure  and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years
because i kept a copy  i have it right here
and why please tell us would you think that
i was telling your wife we have a very good case here
i doubt we will have to go to trial 
 we told them we did not want it to come out this way
i completely understand 
we just 
i understand    i went to the bar association  they tell me you are going to be disbarred
why is that
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittanceshe
that is what the sister said the chart said she ate nine hours prior to
she went in complaining of stomach cramps  good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart
is that what a good doctor would do  how old are you please
i am seventyfour years old
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics
i am on the staff of
actually yes  it is by no means bad i
it is a common medical term
then you are saying there's no negligence based on my question
igiven the limits of your question that is correct
the doctors were not negligent
it was good of you to meet
that is what i would planned to
i am going to take you to the home to see the girl
from what i have seen mr galvin you have a very good case
yes  yes  i think so  i hope you will be comfortable  i am putting you up at my

i did
a single hour
thanks franky
that is for sure frank
yes that is correct
there are notations every thirty seconds
yes the roving nurse
but those notations stop  fourandonehalf minutes after deborah ann kaye's
we we were rather busy
fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped    and they resume seven minutes
as i have said we had some more
they start again three minutes earlier
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes   we were trying to restore her
what happened in those three
we were trying to restore her heartbeat
what happened in those three minutes
we would gone to 'code blue' we were administering electro
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat
because she was anemic  it is right there on her chart her brain was getting less oxygen anyway
so far you are great  you got a cigarette
should i
i accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program
it is not your fault we appreciate you trying
me what did i do
why was not i told
you mean a nanotech synthetic organism
catch him and your record's clean
yes or no mr barnes
madison lives two blocks from their present location
why would they be going there
i do not know
i wish we could hear them
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room but not two prison guards
why would you pull me out
he was a computer program for crissake
you were supposed to act as if everything was real
real my ass it is an overblown game  anybody ever catch that fucking psycho
do me a favor  keep sending them
parker barnes i would like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane

i have not been working on anything
do i get to see it or not

it is nanotechnology is not it machines the size of molecules
coordinated by polymer neural net
it feels so real
it is better than real it is synthetic flesh synthetic blood synthetic organs  it is a physiological machine
this is supposed to be years away
separate the character module from the neural net
amazing i hate to say it but it is
what i need is a nymphomaniac
how should i know
show me his physical sensory level

what you need is a collar
every time i said it it was i never really thought i was going to make it
fine never felt better in my life  see i am a good liar
do not worry if i cannot handle it i will just kill everybody
manson did not kill the first cops to arrive on the scene
whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done
charlie you say that like you are close personal friends
every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers  stay here
do me one favor  if you shoot at anything make sure i am nowhere near it
checking my pulse it is elevated  you enjoy frightening me do not you
you have studied me now i am studying you seems only fair do not you think
maybe after they catch him you should write a book about him
i am still working on it
i have been in prison remember
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho
just like they figured there was no better person to catch one
 here on earth to create havoc and terror i am war i am death i am destruction david berkowitz 1977
i am impressed
for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ
who said that
hamlet  that is david berkowitz got to do with sid 67
he is part of the mix sid 67 is a composite
creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts
as a matter of fact it is
in order to find him we have to understand what makes him tick
give me a goddam break i am not going to go anywhere alone
and i am going to make sure of it  give me your wrist
how did you get your hand out
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life
she is beautiful you know
thankyou  her name is karin
i told you it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes
you should practice lying more often you are awful at it  where to
sid 67 is no longer bound by his programming
what does that mean
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them
then why do not you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while
stop me
this is my area of expertise
enjoying yourself
you know i am
this is not a game parker
tell him
i am doing the best i can
start of what
you could have just flashed him your badge you know
authority still makes me nervous
if you are gonna do it better do it now
they are going to fry me for it anyway
you knew the entire time can you give me one good reason why i should not kill you right now
sid 67 told me after he killed the two guards he suggested i kill you rather than him
you are not capable of it
i pose an unacceptable danger to the public remember
i told you before grimes liked to be obvious
sid 67 is not grimes
part of him is
think he is keeping track of his creation
that or living through him
i am not sureon the bridgethe guy at the payphone
a bomb's going off tomorrow night but i have no idea where
