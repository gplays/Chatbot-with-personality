not the hacking and gagging and spitting part  please
okay then how about we try out some french cuisine  saturday  night
forget it
let me see what i can do
right  see  you are ready for the quiz
forget french
well there's someone i think might be 
you are sweet
eber's deep conditioner every two days and i never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment
i really really really wanna go but i cannot  not unless my sister goes
i am working on it but she does not seem to be going for him
who knows  all i have ever heard her say is that she would dip before dating a guy that smokes
i believe we share an art instructor
i was
you never wanted to go out with 'me did you
then that is all you had to say
what crap
me  this endless blonde babble i am like boring myself
thank god  if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure
what good stuff
the real you
like my fear of wearing pastels
i hope so
they do not
combination  i do not know  i thought he would be different  more of a gentleman
i do not have to be home until two
i did
it is a gay cruise line but i will be like wearing a uniform and stuff
hi joey
you are concentrating awfully hard considering it is gym class
you know the deal  i can ' t go if kat does not go 
nowhere hi daddy
can you at least start wearing a bra
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we are going
i think you are a freak  i think you do this to torture me  and i think you suck
that is normal
bogey lowensteings party is normal but you are too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that
at least i am not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig
it is shakespeare  maybe you have heard of him
can we go now
i really do not think i need any social advice from you right now
like you care
but you hate joey
now i do  back then was a different story
as in
you did what
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
i am not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
i guess i thought i was protecting you
i guess i will never know will i
so did you
you set me up
i just wanted 
what to completely damage me  to send me to therapy forever what
no i just wanted
it is just you
no you are not dating until your sister starts dating  end of discussion
what if she never starts dating
then neither will you  and i will get to sleep at night
but it is not fair  she is a mutant daddy
exactly my point
and where are you going
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends
otherwise known as an orgy
if kat's not going you are not going
it is just a party daddy
daddy no
just for a minute
the prom  kat has a date
no but
it is that hot rod joey right that ' s who you want me to bend my rules for
he is not a hot rod  whatever that is
you are not going unless your sister goes  end of story
i have a date daddy  and he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
did not have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan  are not they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you
fan of a fan  you see a couple of minors come in
just sent 'em through
so they tell me
c'mon  i am supposed to give you the tour
north actually  how would you   
i was kidding people actually live there
yeah  a couple  we are outnumbered by the cows though
how many people were in your old school
how many people go here
couple thousand most of them evil
yeah but these guys have never seen a horse  they just jack off to clint eastwood
you burn you pine you perish
who is she
bianca stratford  sophomore do not even think about it
why not
sure do  my mom's from canada
guess who just signed up for a tutor
you mean i would get a chance to talk to her
you could consecrate with her my friend
that is her  bianca's sister
the mewling rampalian wretch herself
unlikely but even so she still cannot go out with you  so that is the point
you wanna go out with him
he seems like he thrives on danger
did she actually say she would go out with you
that is what i just said
hey  i have gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street
in that case we will need to make it a schoolwide blow out
will bogey get bent
are you kidding  he will piss himself with joy  he is the ultimate kiss ass
it is a lung cancer issue
her favorite uncle
dead at fortyone
okay  i was not sure
it is her favorite band
hell i have just been going over the whole thing in my head and 
no i ' m not
best case scenario you are back on the payroll for awhile
yeah  we will see
i have retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you will find helpful
do not make me do it man
it is off the whole thing
she is partial to joey not me
i don ' t know  i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
she just needs time to cool off i will give it a day
she kissed me
you get the girl
yeah and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow  tough break
they are running the rest of me next month
not at all
and why would i do that
yeah whatever  i want you to go out with her
sure sparky  i will get right on it
you just said
you need money to take a girl out
but you would go out with her if you had the cake
you are gonna pay me to take out some girl
fine thirty
fifty and you have got your man
i am on it
watching the bitch trash my car does not count as a date
i got her under control she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
forget it
forget her sister then
a deal's a deal
do what
get her to act like a human
enough with the barbie ng ken shit i know
nope  just came by to chat
we do not chat
well actually i thought i would run an idea by you  you know just to see if you are interested
we are not
uh  yeah  we are old friend*
you and verona
what  we took bathes together when we were kids
hey  it is all for the higher good right
patrick verona   random skid
that is pat verona the one who was gone for a year i heard he was doing porn movies
i am sure he is completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
he always look so
block e
just a little
an attempted slit
you could always go with me  i am sure william has some friends
william did not even go to high school
that is never been proven
neither has his heterosexuality
does it matter
if i was bianca it would be any school you want precious  do not forget your tiara
no fear
who cares
i did not have a choice
you did not have a choice  where is kat and what have you done with her
i did bianca a favor and it backfired
you did not
i got drunk  i puked  i got rejected it was big fun
well i guess we are not since we do not have dates 
listen to you  you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica
okay okay we will not go  it is not like i have a dress anyway
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective  we are making a statement
oh good  something new and different for us
oh honey  tell me we have not' progressed to fullon hallucinations
sweating like a pig actually  and yourself
there's a way to get a guy's attention
my mission in life
oh right  friday
like where  the 7eleven on burnside do you even know my name screwboy
i know a lot more than that
i do not really think you warrant that strong an emotion
then say you will spend dollar night at the track with me
and why would i do that
come on  the ponies the flat beer you with money in your eyes me with my hand on your ass
you  covered in my vomit
i was in the laundromat i saw your car thought i would say hi
depends on the topic my fenders do not really whip me into a verbal frenzy
that is what you want is not it
do you mind  you are sort of ruining it for me
you know who the raincoats are
why do not you
i am getting trashed man is not that what you are supposed to do at a party
i say do what you wanna do
funny you are the only one
i just need to lie down for awhile
uh uh you lie down and you will go to sleep
i know just let me sleep
leave it to you to use big words when you are shitfaced
why  are you doing this
i told you
you do not care if i die
sure i do
like you could find one
see that  who needs affection when i have got blind hatred
just let me sit down
you know what they say
but it is gigglepuss  i know you like them  i saw you there
then why would you ask
why would you lie
do what
my father would not approve of that that
you do not strike me as the type that would ask permission
i am getting there
he just wants me to be someone i am not
what are you doing here
i heard there was a poetry reading
you  are so 
do not for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
so what did i have an effect on 
other than my upchuck reflex nothing
look up sunshine
c'mon  it is not that bad
try looking at it from this angle
forget it  i am staying
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect  and piss you off
good call
so how would you get chapin to look the other way
i dazzled him with my wit
yeah well do not let it get out
so that is your excuse
acting the way we do
something like that
then you screwed up
i hate peas
no  something real  something no one else knows
you are sweet  and sexy  and completely hot for me
you are amazingly selfassured has anyone ever told you that
go to the prom with me
you know what i mean
no i will not go with you
why not
because i do not want to it is a stupid tradition
so i have to have a motive to be with you
you tell me
you need therapy  has anyone ever told you that
answer the question patrick
nothing  there's nothing in it for me just the pleasure of your company
it is scurvy's  his date got convicted where would you get the dress
it is just something i had  you know
oh huh
look i am   sorry  that i questioned your motives  i was wrong
it gets worse  you still have your freshman yearbook
you were paid to take me out  by  the one person i truly hate  i knew it was a setup
it was not like that
really  what was it like  a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
i did not care about the money
i thought you could use it when you start your band
is that right
yeah but then i fucked up i fell for her
because i like to torture you
oh bianca  can you get me my freshman yearbook
don ' t you even dare  
i thought we decided you were going to school here  at u of 0
you decided
then tell them i had a seizure
is this about sarah lawrence you punishing me
i thought you were punishing me
why cannot we agree on this
because you are making decisions for me
as a parent that is my right
so what i want does not matter
yeah  she left with some bikers big ones  full of sperm
no daddy
so tell me about this dance was it fun
parts of it
which parts
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy
bianca did what
that is the matter  upset that i rubbed off on her
no  impressed
oh christ  do not tell me you have changed your mind  i already sent 'em a check
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action
the point is kat  people perceive you as somewhat 
just smack her now
yeah  i guess
oh yeah
the situation is my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford
what is it with this chick  she have three tits
dorsey can plow whoever he wants i am just in this for the cash
so dorsey can get the girl
we are your guys
just for now
i am liking you guys better
no  i have got a sweetpaying job that i am about to lose
sweet love renew thy force
man  do not say shit like that to  me people can hear you
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls
it was a bratwurst  i was eating lunch
with the teeth of your zipper
touch of the flu
i am at a loss then  what should we talk about your year of absence
that is to discuss

your mother was blind
yeah she went blind giving birth to me she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me
back in the czech republic
yeah yeahbad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind  and my father blamed me for her blindness
your father blamed you for your mother's blindness
yeah he hated me from day when i was born  put it out  can you put the cigarette out
your father put cigarettes out on you
out on my back when i was a small boy

i used an accelerant
yeah  what kind
hey by the way i am really sorry about your wife leaving you
i heard  who the hell let them up there
i do not know you think eddie will give me his autograph
you see anything in the crowd  anybody suspicious
naw  i am sure the suspect's not here
oh yeah why
'cause eddie woulda locked him up by now
but you knew that right
he knew all along
you hear that question garcia
are not you tired
if i go home i will not be able to fall asleep anyway
it hurts  aw jesus
lay down  stay down bobby
not good
what the hell happened
they were inside  they booby trapped her apartment
capra  that is not czech or russian who said he sounded russian
the clerk
look you cannot shoot him in cold blood
yes  my psychiatrist did not insist that i stay on my medication
so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
and is not there a movie in the works about you
we are in negotiations that is correct
but does not the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
well how nice to see you again elena you are looking wonderful
right just a sec
sure what is it
well it is nothing really important but it is annoying
that is up
it is about my salary cheques
well what do you think we ought to do about it
i do not think we should make any fuss about it yet i am sure they will straighten it out
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
no i never did either
i suppose so though of course there's a more sinister explanation
no as a matter of fact i did not
that seems very unlikely
yes i thought so
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
that is true
i know it would be almost inconceivable
but not completely inconceivable
i suppose it is not logically impossible
i guess it is not
still all we have to do is ask hal
yes i do not know what to make of it
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
yes but it is more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
anyway it is just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry
are you reasonably awake
oh i am fine i am wide awake that is up
well hal's reported the aounit about to fail again
you are kidding
two units in four days how many spares do we have
two more
well i hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise we are out of business
i guess you do not know your own strength old boy
i guess not
i think i will have to go out and burn them off
what is it hal
my fpc shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
i understand hal we will take care of it please let me have the hard copy
sure dave that is up
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition
yes i know
you probably also know that we found them okay
yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail
hal is there anything bothering you  anything that might account for this problem
well do not worry about it
and do not you worry about it
is your confidence in me fully restored
yes it is hal
well that is a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
yes it is
i suppose you are pretty broken up about it
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
look dave your have probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
hal switch to manual hibernation control
i am fine daddy when are you coming home
yes i know that sweetheart
are you coming to my party
no i am sorry darling i told you i will not be home for a few days
when are you coming home
in three days darling i hope
mommy's out to the hair dresser
where is mrs brown
she is in the bathroom
okay sweetheart well i have to go now tell mommy that i called
how many days until you come home
three darling one two  three be sure to tell mommy i called
thank you daddy
i will wish you a happy birthday now and i will see you soon all right darling
yes daddy
'bye 'bye now sweetheart
goodbye daddy
thank you
well how is it going back there
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight
i will bet it is a fortune
oh she is growing up very fast as a matter of fact she is six tomorrow
oh that is such a delightful age
how is gregor
well that does sound very odd
no thank you and i am afraid now i really must be going
well i hope that you and your wife can come to the iac conference in june
thank you it is been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov
please it really does not matter
well did you have a pleaant flight
yes very pleasant
well shall we go through documentation
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
yes it is coming along very well
yes really thank you very much
are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
yesas a matter of fact i am
well it is just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius
that is right
i see
fortunately they did
well i am glad about that
dr smyslov i am not permitted to discuss this
how can you tell it was deliberately buried
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
any clue as to what it is
tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice
i do not think it has but i would like to check that simpson that is the log on that
there's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
when do we arrive at clavius
we are scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you
oh no thank you the two girls have taken wonderful care of me i am just fine
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
what do you mean
i take it this is something to do with the trouble they are having up at clavius

pardon me
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling
well it is tempting but no thanks
catchy title  what are you really reading  hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting
i tear off the cover and paste this one on  you know how it is
would not want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts
might get drummed out of the pornographer's union and then where would i be
came back for that batteryoperated vagina right  told you you would

you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else
i see a ring on your finger  you have any kids
a daughter
a weirdo making sm films  who would have thought it
his stuff comes out of new york bondage and fetish videos gothic hardcore  definitely not for the squeamish
specialty product
you are learning
where does he sell it
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images thinks he is making art
well i am in new york now  what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand
i am a working stiff pops
take a vacation  i will pay you four hundred a day plus expenses
you want me to come out there and play private eye
consider it  meanwhile dig up whatever dino velvet films you can get receipts  i will call back

i told you he is one of dino velvet's stock players
who is he his name

i try to be
apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak
thank you
he is a lawyer  please sit here
you are highly recommended  praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality
my condolences
his passing has left me with something of a dilemma  a terrible terrible dilemma
i will do whatever i can to help
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to  other than that there's never any reason
just curious
cash stock certificates and this
i am afraid i do not
of course  but i am certain it is nothing to worry about
i told you i cannot not yet
you do not have any other choice
you have found missing persons before
nothing remotely like this
i am not positive this means anything
the checks were for odd amounts
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
you are joking
to the penny  exactly one million dollars in cash
do you think the film could have cost that much
you are one hell of a detective mrs christian
how are you  having any luck
i do not know if luck's the word are you feeling alright
i have been ordered into bed  the doctor says i have gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment

neil neil cole

do you think the police did a good job
i do not know  i think so
will you let me look
my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me
it is been six years
i remember  you just left
she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress
who is this 
they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her

stick around please
he invited me to his house last night
it was supposed to be  dad had a heart attack two days ago
how is he  
it was moderate  he will be all right  but it was out of the question his coming along
and they thought uyouu could re place the skipper
your 'out'  this came for you 
my father  he is not  
dead  matter of fact he is much better he is left the hospital
that may be  but dad stays where uheu is and i am staying here
you are really a mixedup oddball are not you
thenthis is a 'flying saucer'
but if they udou
i do not know
helen  i appeal to you 
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
disappointing a ubigu girl
i guess
'his' side  i have seen it all right a nice bright yellow
skipper  look at the depth gauge
not ualoneu you are not
go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper
you know  it uisu
let's get back to work and maybe we uwillu be soon
the sound again
somewhere down there
wonder where powell and carney are
we will have to look for them later
oh it does
right skipper
seems to be all around
what about down
ido not know
speedabout twentytwo knots coursedue north
right at our oneeyed friend
the frogmen
with their underwater experience they will be invaluable  take sidearms and flare pistols 
sidearms  but the saucer's dead
we hope
yes griff
all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor
something wrong
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
why do you say that
we are dead in the water  but it indicates we are moving
radiation levelconstantly rising
under uwateru
highintensity arcs will burn submerged  and millions of voltsdischarged in random directions
suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit  perhaps be lying there waiting  
if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
what direction does the system indicate
there's got to be an explanation
there is  i believe our friendcyclops is returning to life
as ready as we ucanu be  i will report to the skipper
who with
dr neilsen  he will be  
i think i should have joined the air force
after torpedo room  report
take a look
thirtyfour seconds
that is what i said
but  what can we accomplish
we can uramu him
nothing we can do now
minus three
come where
point of view is everything to us uyouru form of life is ugly as we appear to you
tell me something  why can uiu hear you when the others could not
 for horrors like yourself
i am afraid not  therefore 
on the contrary  i want you  unharmed  perfect
that is why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
of course  but it is time to be gin the return voyage 
thank you

or perhaps until he gets us

you be careful of that little bastard he is dying to get in your pants you know
this town sucks

the fucker shot himself kerbang that is what it sounds like not on purpose i assume accidental
where how would you hear that
it is called a grilled cheese sandwich you dub
well i guess  that is what he said
he got his deer yet
from wickham's been a while like some coffee
how you and ma doing have not seen you in town for a while

everything you know is from me
i do not know you my goddamn father and i do not know you
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business
you think jack shot him
well it was an accident
they were out deer hunting right jack probably heard the gun go off then came back and found the body
how was she

what happened
a divorce lawyer a custody lawyer you know 'cause of jill

what about jill is lillian bringing her
no thanks i do not drink
yeah i forgot
what about her
well do you still plan to get married
i guess it was an accident like everybody thinks
want to know what i think happened
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one
which is
that it was not an accident
then who shot him
well your friend i think jack hewitt
motive you gotta have a motive
they would not deal with a guy like jack who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead
i do not know you tell me
a hunting accident is perfect
right's right goddamnit do not you care that is right
i care about what happened the truth i am a student of history remember
of course it happened why would i lie about it
it may have happened but not the way you said
you think i would not remember a thing like that
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
well i never heard that one
for what
well you are not the president dear
yeah no duh
i am sure he is busy
do not you even want to ask
you are jetlagged  we will talk about this back
back at the fishbowl
i am sorry honey
no it is okay  after all he is the president right
your father never means to be so
that is not really the point
big secret  you said the same thing to newsweek
i am sorry i was so mean to you earlier
jim for godsake
you must be tired it will wake you up
no thank you the gunfire did that
so you study world events little one that is good for a girl your age

you are a resilient man mr
hey you guys back already
it was the experience of a lifetime
how bout a hug for the old man
been better dad you
it is okay honey i got you i got you you are okay
okay i am slowing us down
did we warn them off
yes they refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails
they are in our airspace we would be within our rights
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner
warn then again if they do not respond shoot them down we will not be intimidated
got it
pop it open there should be a red switch toggle it up
okay it is on we have got some indicator lights here
cross it  the static overwhelms the voice then cuts out
copy air force one welcome to the party
you read my mind
put your pilot on
he is busy being dead
i am doing what i can
okay we are gonna arc a fat one to the right got it
got it
stay cool
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way
just stay on my wing sir i will take you all the way in
no we are losing fuel and my rudder's not responding
lemme take a look
sluggish i think it is jammed too
uh tower we got a problem up here
we do not know that
holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you are making demands
that kid's name was jim marshall
this does not make sense
i prefered the terrorists
that is game set and match there's nothing to do except call the chief justice
thanks  wrote it last night
an exercise in futility send the nimitz back in
does your office have anything to add mr dean
we have got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace
iraqi's will not buy it either they are already in on this or they will think we are spying
if fired upon tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage
to swear you in as president
yes mr president
you are duty to what the country you served does not exist anymore
my loyalty was never to my country
about goddamn time
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet over
air force one acknowledged  tnt emergency parachute launch ramp
ga get it
sir this plane carries the president of the united states
we checked the manifest everyone was accounted for
a secret service agent it must be
why did they do that
psychology they are trying to unnerve us
well it worked
we are not going to make it
not even close hell we cannot even make syria or iraq
where are we now
over the black sea i can probably get us to turkey or georgia
romeo tango zulu copy one the television graphics of the first family against the presidential seal
stand by
romeo tango zulu1 this is tower
tower here
i guess it depends on your perspective
conference rooms though some have other functions  the one up front doubles as an emergency medical center
maria maria mitchell
and what is it you do ms mitchell
how are your fellow hostages feeling ms mitchell
scared we are scared
very good thank you ms mitchell
come on alice
or you will do what mrs marshall  but i admire your courage your husband on the other hand
what do you know of my husband
i know he left you behind
my husband is a very courageous man
i neither enjoy nor dislike i do what is necessary
how can you i mean they are people

no mr president  it cannot
rose i do not have time for this
how do you know she understands you have not spent more than five minutes with her or me in weeks
but that is the point jim we are right here
i wish it were that easy
i should trust that promise because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut
this promise is not subject to congressional approval
well they are not burning me in effigy that is always a good sign
shall i ask the chief of staff to schedule your daughter in
please do not start with me
both of you
flying the plane
you have not even driven a car since you took office
excuse me
the fax machines
no good i said they disabled the communications system
no i thought about this mr
white house situation room
actually sir you could be that someone
they are still alive but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes
then tell me there's a rescue operation underway
you know my policy we do not negotiate with terrorists if we start now all of america becomes a target
but this is different sir you are the president
we are under attack

he and the nra do not like the wording
right christ i am tired  do me a favor and keep me away from the press

the girl out front mentioned strader's assistant somebody named watson  maybe he knows
todd  todd does not know either
a virgin  i find that very arousing
your voice is saying no but your body is saying yes
that is right

ss'ai k'ss  perfect
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is
she did did she  well she was wrong  excuse me i have to change
show me
jesus sykes  it is been less than ten hours  me and alterez are on it okay
you do not have squat
lay off asshole
i may be an asshole but at least i am a real detective not some outer shit space thing
sergeant detective  i was not aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet
you were partners with him on some slag  uh newcomer real estate thing
no sergeant  not history  eternity
this is becoming a serious breach of security
he did not recognize me
it is his new partner that i am worried about
gesundheit  you do not mind if i stick to george do you
his body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of central avenue near downtown
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest
through the chest  rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
nice signal dickwad
there was no wallet but he was still wearing a watch and two rings
great  well i am sure glad that is settled are not you
and that fits
well yeah it is rubber  it stretches
and still it fits
how the hell do you know that
why the hell  great fine  you talk to the wife
did you learn anything
she did not know him  but she said her son might
did you talk to him
he has not been home since that day but she told me where to find him
we would like to ask you about a business associate of your warren hubley
why would i do what
at the end of the bar
uh matthew
back off george
but i 
i will handle it
screw me  that cannot be right
your mother mates out of season
stay back  i am okay
from quarantine when my people first arrived here  he and i were housed together
how could a straightarrow like you ever pick a roommate like him
this is mole  it is good
ss'loka'  it means literally small but intelligent creature  it loses much in the translation
and what was that one about my mother  that was a good one
ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'
yeah that is it  say it slow
todd watson  the assistant manager
when will strader return
my wife  she worries about me
you are married

warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub

how potent
we all did
where did he get it  was there any of it on the ship
i must trust you matthew  i cannot stop this without you
if the drug is here we must destroy it
no george  you are missing the point  the drug is evidence  we need to have the evidence ya know
where is the drug  where have they taken it
why  that is the big goddamn deal
there  go back  down that side street
do what  george 
 it is harcourt
harcourt is dead
why the hell are you so dead set against backup
because because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming
but there's no more drug
you understand that  but how many others will
you look very good
what is it
casull 454 magnum  you are talking twice the impact energy of 44 magnum hot loads
only holds five

yes it is  thirtyfive percent pure methane gas in there  i do not know how these fellas do it
for you anything
i am sorry matt  nothing here seems to be matching up
sure  just a minute
yeah i seen him around  high roller dude named strader  joshua strader  runs a club on the west side  encounters
yeah i heard of it
that is all i know  you want anything more you ask somebody else

you mean the blob  they are finishing up now
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day

what happened to them
yes i believe he did
come to my office miss price
it is a full moon where is he
at my flat i am off at midnight and
alex has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies
well yes but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend
has his friend appeared to him again
david says jack comes to warn him

dr hirsch that is wrong is this more serious than i know
no he knows no one in london besides me i should not have left him alone
let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
is he all right why did not you call me where was he
he does not remember he woke up at the zoo

do you like it
i have just started it my friend gave it to me

your dead friend jack
yeah he says that i will become a monster in two days what do you think
i would think so

i looked
really susan i do not think that was very proper and besides it is common practice now
yes mrs hobbs
you did did you
hey you asshole i want you to arrest me
there's no call for that kind of language
queen elizabeth is a man prince charles is a faggot winston churchill was full of shit

why are you doing this to me
no but we are about to
quiet everyone hush shhh

you could have told them
i was having a nightmare
what time is it
it is nearly eight i am off duty shortly then i am off to the films with alex
what are you going to see
some everyone does
yes but does everyone kill bambi
where am i
you are in a hospital in london
london where is jack i had a strange dream
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences
the guy i was with is he all right how did i get to london
now david i want you to prepare yourself your friend is dead
get your fucking hands off me what the hell is going on here
you have been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
two weeks
so they said
doctor my memory is fine it is my sanity i am beginning to worry about
sure as a kid but never so real never so bizarre
did you see jack
no in fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here
did you talk to the police in east proctor did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb
i really do not know
of course not david i will fetch in young miss price
oh i do not know i mean look around is not this a fun place
i am sorry northern england first italy later
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
she is a jerk
you are talking about the woman i love
i am talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
well anyway do you think she will be there
i do not know
i have to make love to her it is very simple she has no choice really
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull
we have known debbie what since the eighth grade how many years of foreplay is that
she says she 'likes me too much'
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
that is a wolf's head
of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol
that is not a spear it is a pike
a severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol
listen at least it is warm in here
look at that
it is a fivepointed star
maybe the owners are from texas
you ask them
you ask them
what do you mean i am starving
apparently so
i do not know let's see if there's an inn or something up the road
beware the moon
come on i am freezing
i have no idea
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural
i see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it because they felt so silly
i am well aware of how pleasant the weather is in rome at the present time thank you
i heard that
what was it
there are not any coyotes in england
the hound of the baskervilles
pecos bill
no but he was on the moors
it is a full moon 'beware the moong

not far enough come on
i will tell you when we get there
well i am glad we whoaa

yeah your parents came to my funeral i was surprised at how many people came
why should you be surprised you were a very wellliked person
debbie klein cried a lot
i cannot stand it

rudy levine the shmuck
life mocks me even in death
warn me will you get out of here you meat loaf
i am not listening
on the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf
shut up you zombie
i was murdered an unnatural death and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted
that is wrong with you shut up
the wolf's bloodline must be severed the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed

it is still taking too long the people used to snap to
that was because of the reputation the gang had
as long as people think jesse's still riding we will never get the respect we deserve
cole we are outlaws not exactly the most respectable job if you know what i mean
leave me alone bob
what have you done
i ai not done 
what have you done
swear on jimmy's grave
you are just upset about jesse we all are
he is not bad at it
it is tougher than it looks
i can hit those boys from here we just need a distraction
 will perry 
stop by our spread after that tell our ma we are all right we will go to doc mimms
he just lost his temper a little
the army can hang him
not yet but i am hoping
one false move and i will blow your heads off
you heard me jesse you know how crazy i get
yes i am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies
you are a fine figure of a man
listen jesse we have got a problem  it is cole
he is been full of vinegar lately
he is planning a job
tell me
i think i recognize you
that is going on
i could use the walk
suit yourself we will have some horses waiting for you at the road  let's ride rangers
there's yankees back there lot's of 'em
planting corn harvesting corn year after year
you are not scared are you
pick your fights cousin you taught me that
what is wrong with you
in case we have to kill these sonofabitches i do not want them to see us coming
she got two of them
she was european
all right calm down i will agree sadie was a woman 
after all you did on our farm  you miss it do not you jesse
the war what are you crazy  there are things i miss about it
it was exciting
but it was a whole lot of killing why should we miss that
just like in the war harass their supply lines we kill the railroad's men they will not care
let's ride
i got three
just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words does not make him smart
sure cousin
all the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the jamesyounger gang
hold on hold on we all know bob is an important part of the gang
what will be
if you would read about it first you would have no problems
what are you saying
a bad idea
i got us through the war all right
and almost got hanged in peacetime
that is it
and i am the better outlaw
then let me run the show general lee
clell tom go get doc mimms in liberty
pass me some whisky
i am out
what we follow you for a year and now that our blood's been spilled you are gonna quit
who's next you me bob
missed you too cousin
pff all we been through the thought never crossed my mind
we did not zerelda did turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw
you pay me to find you bluecoats there they are
both would be nice
soon as i hit one the other will know and beat us up
must be a garrison in town we are in occupied territory boys
which one right or left
the brown one
sadie was not a man
shakespeare  he is european
get buckets
they gonna rush us
they are just insurance in case we run
of course  uh sir
this here is the younger gang
all right all right  jesse james never yelled at folk
yeah injun what do you want
great chief of st louis send me
the district marshall
me get heap firewater 
you are right sir
then why cannot i go in there
on account of we are robbing it
oh why did not you just say so
it is a secret
fine i will just wait here
i would appreciate that
what is it
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank
i had you covered  from back there
my little web did that
pff he jumped his horse clear over our heads killed a dozen union soldiers before they knew what hit them
died a hero
go on you are pretty much all healed up
the bullet came out clean but he lost a whole lot of blood praying would not hurt
i fooled them into thinking i was alone
well i hope the boy pulls through we should know in the morning
i think he is already feeling better
so we got a plan
pff they hardly even noticed you
so you are saying i could have done more to attract their attention
you could have worn one of those big floppy womangs easter sunday hats
that would have made an impression
i figure
see that is your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff i am already finished doing it
no jesse your problem is you are always doing stuff before i am finished figuring it out
i reckoned
hell of a war
i am sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
we better go to doc's see that is going on here
you are doing just fine
zee we got to talk to you and your father
what kind of story are they going to believe
maybe maybe
you can shut up now
you are a charmer
i swear i will shoot you in your sleep
next time try fat and haggard
what worries me is that jesus is talking back
heard of him
what do you think
shut up  uh doc i was wondering if uh this evening i could come by
do not care
did not think you would  i am going to go make the coffin
make a thousand of 'em still will not be enough by the time i am through
fine how would it go out here
we are gonna have to talk
and that is why you both lead the gang two of you went into that bank together right
and i do so want to shoot some pinkerton detectives
bob's upset
the posters
bob here will kill a man for sneezing and he is the best shot in the gang
jesse we are outlaws
and we are good at it
it got to you did not it all the killing in the war you need it now
you have killed your fair share of men
if i could go back to farming 
that is a lie you could have bought a dozen farms with the money we have stolen
i cannot quit and leave you alone i cannot quit until you quit ma would have wanted it that way
we are doing this for ma
maybe it started out that way but now
oh yeah
just do me a favor think about what this is costing everybody not just the railroad
no i 
got any ideas little brother
jim was old enough
you are a pisspoor liar for the smartest man i know
i am sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
see you soon oh and i appreciate the distraction back there
hell they hardly even noticed us
yeah jimmy
that he was
they are making him a hero now
saved a lot of folk from the railroad
but he killed a lot of men too
cannot argue that
so what was he
i think he was just a real interesting fella to have around
yeah jimmy
how much of that story is true
everything but the boring parts
a fair number ma
say your prayers
he is a good christian and he killed yankees jesus told me that made him an all right boy
somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today
take care of each other boys you say your prayers
you were little jesse james when you left
but you got big
if there's anything we can do for you dr mimms we want to help
i have been on my back two weeks i am sick of it
you are sick of my company
no i mean of course not no
teasing you is completely unfair
what you do to me is unfair the teasing i mean
i should not tease a hero
so you are saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger
unfair you are completely unfair
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate
a river pirate
arr hand over your jewels missy
thank god you grew out of that  you did grow out of that did not you
mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james
not if i find the right girl
and that is this right girl like
smart funny bossy always makes me think she is two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth
where will you find such a girl
honestly you would do if only you had the buck teeth
sparkling rocks
little ones
is this one of frank's shakespeare poems you are trying to quote
i have been planning on kissing you for a very long time
frank and me have to go away for a while
me neither
let the law 
laws do not touch men like thaddeus rains only justice does
whose justice yours or god's  when will you stop
when my name makes them cry in their sleep when i have brought them to ashes
i had to see you i am getting married
she is the most wonderful woman in the world cannot get her out of my mind
that is wonderful it is just i thought
she is beautiful smart and has the biggest buck teeth in all of missouri
that is why i picked it we can start a whole new life down here
are you going to be happy here mr james without all that excitement
blazing guns of the west true stories of jesse james only a dime in the hotel lobby
let me see that
stop it this is just sad
swimming swimming is good
yes ma'am
i cannot believe i had to blow up a train for you
you are a hell of a woman
do not swear
yes ma'am
but i like the presidential suite
that is the idea
not that day i am guilty of many things but that was mr thaddeus rains and parker that day
last february
i went myself to oversee the operation did not help much
no that one was close a couple fellas quit after that one
i figured
was it worth it
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it
that is what i would have done
i am not hanged yet
you cocky little bastard
ahh you will miss me
no i will hang you  but i may miss you just a bit
he is too important james  they will set the army on you you and your wife
fair enough
you do not think god will mind do you
thank you
who needs to repair a leaky church roof
right here in church
i am the same age you were when you went off to war
and the same age web was no
yeah hey are you drinking whisky you are too young to be drinking whisky
not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink
i guess so
tonight why i am just getting ready to turn on the younger charm
you been with a girl ever
tell you something else  i cannot drink that good neither i am going to go outside and throw up
you do that
this time we will make an exception
jesse you explain to lyla my girl you know from that time
you are gonna tell her when you are resting up in bed with her jimmy
i hope you do not mind jesse james told me your name
oh you were talking to jesse
yes but just so i could find out who you were
not at all
i just though you were awful cute
thank you miss  
lyla devereux
gosh that is a pretty name buy you a drink
could we go upstairs and talk it is so loud down here
why do not we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk
that is so gentlemanly of you
i am doing you folks a favor 
they had to be dealt with
by burning down their homes
move you fools
and it is my pleasure to be here
yes sir
just perfect
i will teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress
thirtyfive thousand sir coins and currency and the delay from the miles of destroyed track 
i will kill them for blowing up my railway
to be precise they did not blow up the tracks
then who did
we did
what is going on here man
we should go burn that school to the ground sir
i look forward to seeing it
what sir
i remember you
not such a menace now is he pinkerton
not to mention my men who lost their lives
oh no i would have done that but i would have made sure i killed them too
i want them arrested and hanged
would a jury around here convict their own i think not we are beginning an interesting game here mr rains
this is no game
i am afraid our adversaries do not agree
it is going to be a long winter
and there are some towns in missouri where james and his men can walk openly as heroes
i demand action
it is going to be a long spring
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
can you put men at all four
no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank
what is that
why their intense hatred of you of course

you will look like you consciously worked for the look
good point excuse me gentlemen
they still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mindaltering drugs
you are a fanatic
'gonna wait outside
make him
you know what i mean
you know what he is like he just wants to work on stuff that is cool
you do not wanna move do you
i can paint anywhere
if he is really a bully he will not cop to it anyway
bully are we talking about gary boyd or your dad
i forgot that is why you have to help me decide
no way you have this  destiny
c'mon i would not have a destiny without you my destiny would be dying at 20 from eating 
do not bring that up like a different girlfriend would would have let you die
you saved my life in alot of ways
prob'ly waiting by the phone for outpost to call we will leave it for him
we are not gonna let it
milo what about 
that is what i need to ask you  you know you cannot keep anything from me
i know i know
if you cannot deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
is not that  extreme
you are right it is  a working relationship do not know what i was expecting
what are you  what
it was a hate crime
i do not know what i am saying maybe  maybe they hired those guys
i cannot see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
go where you cannot get away from people like this
like this it is gary you are talking about
you think i do not know that
milo why would he 
you cannot just walk in either
whaddo i do
so you believe me
i remember
poor baby you know that is not true
he has thousands of employees milo 
it is for the museum he knows you are a painter if anybody should be invited 
i went to see the skywire model in gary's office you know just to hold it again
yeah give me a goodbye kiss
oh right hold on
it is gonna get cold
right wait a toast
you are just afraid to eat it
that will be a test will not it
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl fire her or something
i do not think he knows how
right that is that mean again
like i said shot in the dark
it is  milo is not it
yes sir i need to talk to you
give me two seconds with lacy here  go on in i will not be a moment
have a seat
i am i am sir
my goodness
i  just wanna help bring these guys to justice they are neonazis
let me look into it see that is being done frankly it is not my area
'just did not know who else to talk to
and outpost you are happy there
yes sir
'forgot to introduce you  i have a girlfriend
you cannot preempt yoga that is our biggest show
brian you wanna be a big deal do not you that is your dream in life
no but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this we are gonna bring down outpost
gimme the coordinates
is it your dish
you should have called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
outpost does not own em
there's no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems to have vanished
is not there a stigma bankrolling this guy
stigma larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
and the kid who wrote skywire  then gave it away they are calling him the digital robin hood
milo surprised he is not your guest
we tried
you better believe everybody's trying to sign him up
oh hi
he is pretty tight with his family
we could move 'em up here
he just likes to write code he is bummed there's so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
i think they call him the houseman 'cause guard sounds too weird
oh no thanks
there's a rumor going around maybe you have heard it
i do
okay i am gary
do i
somebody said i am just another philistine with reproductions
that is insane you are ahead of your time
that is what i told her my wife
maybe i am going too fast
too fast at least four companies are on the verge of workable convergence systems milo they 
take a look at this slightly different approach
you are making me young again
well  you sent for me
right right
what are you implying
were the flags for teddy
just once 'guess i was worried we did not have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
did you
talk about work never
i meant did you find other stuff to 
oh yeah
you have been coming in early
it helps alice said it would help to focus on something   wouldo not know what i would do without her
34000 but they are real short lines 'just came out that way
the wrong place
the answer's not in the box it is in the band
you look a little tired
i am okay it is going well
'have a look
'sorry about the late notice
i am not much good at handwriting or parties
oh that is right you are clueless
you see that is hanging on the wall
'startup not 50 miles from here kid's on prozac
maybe we should all get on it
there may be a little less trust after your outburst
nothing does still i want him to like me
gary do not worry we 
just do what i am asking
longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes 
let's go
longitude 109 
wait he knows
in exchange for endowments they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em
you do
i mean it is your life
man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
those really weird short lines
we will come up with the next big thing
you wanna work  here
got out of my other commitment
unlikely all 14 cameras are frozen do we call randy and phil tell 'em there may have been a breakin
keep looking
what are we looking for
any irregularity in the pattern
let's get him in here
they know 'just they do not trust me with it so we will get the evidence first ask questions later
i am calling gary
where we going
i launched skywire just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to gary's satellite
you know mine
you are famous around here
i am getting a teacher's pet rep
i would not worry about it you have gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets
were you
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
me too were you an army brat or something
something like that yeah
graphical interfaces for skywire i am s'posed to coordinate with you
show me
no please
right right but does he ever just like hand you code
maybe once i rewrote it anyway
you are compulsive
mmmmore like  i have a little trouble trusting people
why's that
long story not that interesting
then and now  but not right now
she saved my life
why would you do a thing like 
they would frame him
he is out of prison
no no never
they have got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person it is over
who can we trust
there's always a logical answer  you just have to define the question
right but gary's tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home
certainly not at my happy home
gary knows i am close on skywire we have to do this fast
before they kill somebody else too
oh man i would have to get into gary's house to get the satellite positions
you mean  break in
i do not know 
i thought the worst they would do is fire me who knew they took termination so literally
oh  i liked you i was checking you out
'cause their apartments might be bugged
what would he say
a beautiful geek what are the chances
the dishes are juiced up too
thank god
milo shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
perfect  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to 
you could always say you have to go the bathroom
that is lame is not it
you will come up with something
at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary
tell me you are not calling on your car phone
it is three years old it 
bring it to the other location
but you said the other 
let's try 2
wait a second he knows i know
and your phone messages you wanna do what you do it is not a crime
is that how larry feels
uh not exactly
hey we got seed money for the startup a millionfive
jesus teddy
what come on is it serious
i do not know
did you tell alice
what d'you mean
i dunno i guess larry's got me totally suspicious of that place
what does that mean
milo geeks do not have two girlfriends most do not have one
i did not plan this
oh we are not going to the campus
his snapples were in alphabetical order
well he micromanaged the company till it got too big  'guess he needs to micromanage something
she is a programmer
heavy graphical background doing designinterface for skywire apps  you will be working with her
i have got a girlfriend remember
right that is rare around here you know how nuns' remarried to jesus 'posties are married to outpost
can we buy into their ipo or is that a justice dept problem
speaking of which
yeah yeah
damn 'have to go back over there  be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
you do not look anything like a three yearold
unless it is a diversion milo's in my office he was tailgating so i 
i could get it out of him
you are not listening
where is he
we are too late take a look
wait a second i am the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
we are all grateful for that really go out the way you came in
shame i was recommended by a friend
normally we would be eager to oblige 
you do not say how real does it feel
as real as you wish hot or cold humid or dry anything you like within reason
there are limits
three days
ah but you have not see the real me watch closely 
you mean you do not recall
promised who promised
there look
mr john steed please
i am afraid that is impossible
as you see
then you cannot come in
i have an appointment
no women not in boodles not since 1922
really  what happened in 1922
eh in here
we have met 
quite right but we still make the rules
rules are made to be broken
people too
then who wins
let me guess  'father'
something strange is happening and whoever knows about it does not want us to find out
directed by laser bounced by satellite quite possible
you need treatment mrs peel  you cannot resign
watch me
we want to help
to you  
a cover  for us  i am sorry
to find out who killed my husband
the doors and walls are monitored mrs peel this is a very secure establishment
so am i
next assignment
thank you steed
thanks valentine 
dr darling peter  all you 
an unholy trinity 
you killed my husband
for starters of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well 
too many cooks 
spoil the majority shareholders in wonderland weather i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you 
but i found you all the clues led me here 
of course i planned that too
but  why
you disappoint me emma  cannot you guess  for you it was all for you 
'our revels now are ended'
oh no emma they have only just begun 
i am already married 
valentine listen to me 
right bridesmaid now what have i left out oh yes i know the ring
you are mad
entirely on the other hand  mad people get things done let me show you 
destruction of their local weather systems i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
the result would be 
chaos transport paralysis crop failure  economic disaster frostbite or sunburn  on a massive scale you have seen a few samples
then that is stopping you
and you must be steed please do not get up
i had a spot of bother at the door
i should not wonder not a woman inside boodles since 
1922 why the kippers
red herring would have been too obvious do not you think
so what was all this  some sort of test
congratulations you have penetrated a bastion of male privilege i guessed you were not a stickler for tradition doctor
whereas you are
dyed in the wool but i can admire someone who does not play by the rules
rules are made to be broken
not by me play by the rules doctor or the game is nothing
and just what is the game
i say this is all terribly formal must i go an calling you dr peel
under the circumstances you may call me mrs peel
much better
we are not here to talk about the weather surely
a kipper or a red herring what were they investigating
really  i fail to see the connection
i had a feeling you would touche
yes indeed i need protection
oh absolutely but trubshaw's a man worth meeting no point setting out half shod
or half cocked
thank you trubshaw 
do you really think so
not all tradition is bad mrs peel no thank you
the most unpredictable piece on the board and always ready to protect his queen
that is predictable when i find a queen in need of protection i will let you know
as per mother's instructions
do we always follow mother's instructions
for a man in my position 
i have no choice why should you risk your life
after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking more tea
no thanks
i meant me
june july  august
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
any other vices
small talk  try the weather
you should be dead  how do you feel
i mean your man trubshaw  your bulletproof waistcoat  i thought you were just overdressed
i might say the same
why should they think that
you told them you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times left you for dead
frankly that is how i remember it
but that is absurd i may not be overfond of you steed but it is not my style
perhaps your memory plays tricks mrs peel
no but he must know incidentally my double left you with this
did you say formal i must dress
you mean my other self 
either way  may i ask why you dress in that fashion
i should have thought that was obvious   i am in mourning
how on earth can you tell
very good steed 
any ideas
well he was a fellow of the royal zoological society 
is that written in his shoe
common knowledge mrs peel 
she had this in her mouth there there
thanks   i see what you mean about letting me do the risking  hello
is there anything that is not
that is what we were working on
sounds as if someone's hijacked your research
 and by you mrs peel 
then a mad millionaire head of a secret defense establishment a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather 
 and by you mrs peel everything points to you  no sisters  no undiscovered twin
not that i know of  explanation
oh well   just my type mrs peel
have i trespassed on a male prerogative  we are being followed i saw him at trubshaw's 
here's the one that broke the camel's back
someone did not want us to get to the party
i expect we will have to gatecrash
i expect that is for you to know and me to find out 
it was peter  i saw him 
nothing personal
no trouble
because you always obey orders 
always  except 
i could be convinced if  i knew who poisoned me in the maze that kiss 
it was not me you have my word
keeping a stiff upper lip
is that all
not for a moment
you are playing games
are not we all mrs peel
i thought you played by the rules
i thought you did not
i am playing to win
winning is not everything
please do not tell me it is how you play the game
after you  mrs peel 
you do not trust me
as far as you trust me
you lied
i equivocated but you are not their big worry at present it is dr darling  he is disappeared 
no idea who no idea why 
teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys all childrengs things 
 or grownups who still like to be children
quite any childhood friends enemies
not to speak of peter and i were both loners there was nobody
why's he called 'invisible'
you will find out
i will catch you up do not worry he is expecting you
hurry  what for  i am just now 
you did not tell her
have we been invited
it is called black leather
intoxicating here have one of these
limpet bomb small very compact from trubshaw's
when all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
you first
shall we
snuff  i must insist you try some
'the merry widow' i might have known where is the reception
have a look at this
where are you going
laying in supplies mrs peel weather may get very nasty and i have no umbrella 
you need not bother i cannot drag you further into this after all i am still the chief suspect
no bother mother and father think i have joined you i might as well
if you would been through what i have you would not 
what kept you
the plot  hello we must be going 
' in a beautiful pea green boat'
a fine night mrs peel 
still a bit chilly 
english weather you know after all we have been through i should say we deserve a long holiday 
have you any place in mind
as a matter of fact i have 
it is the latest thing mrs peel
our little paradise  just made for two
not quite
pity your mother came too 
must be trubshaw's busy i will send mother 
i am no spy  where do i fit in
you are saying i have no choice
mobile hq in a blue funk  cannot take chances i am looking after things while he is hiding out 
it is mother you have to convince he is very agitated  wait here
peter's brother  but 
halfbrother to be precise
i know all this
do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother inlaw was under surveillance
surveillance by whom
father she gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by dr darling
who's now vanished
makes two of us
are you suggesting that dr darling and valentine were somehow in this together but that is absurd
getting to what
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative 
i fail to see 
well i cannot possibly go like this
let me guess  wonderland weather
very good mrs peel 
i shall need a small plane
you are not venturing alone surely
i am going to find out who killed my husband will you take these documents to steed
global warming
jungle plants in the arctic a lush english village transformed overnight into african scrubland blizzards in summer
so you say 
we want mrs peel
dead i am afraid
you reek of mrs peel's black leather 
it was you who gave valentine peel his security clearance  you are the mole who betrayed the ministry
brenda and i thought we would drop in
you did not come to talk about the weather surely
oh yes i did i want you to meet somebody  i expect you will like her
she may not know theory goes she may be very ill
how come you took so much interest in her dr darling
no her husband she says alice tried to warn us a trap tell mother beware tell father that is all
guilty until proven innocent
mother and father know best
you are getting yourself into terrible trouble my son weather's turning very nasty  and so am i
i think so thank you so much 
i feel sure of it
i am alice mother said you would be on your way mrs peel with you
she was 
both actually
this way 
ask not for whom the telephone rings 
no please i beg you 
walk over to the window

stay by the window by the window
valentine peel i see you have gone back to using your original face
the last one you will ever see

no costume  no blackface
i am sorry i am late
do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone
i did not find out about this very important staff meeting until
so are you telling me everyone knew about this gettogether except you
i was not told about this until marie informed me as soon as i got off the elevator
i understand  but again in all honesty i was not informed
nigger  nigger  nigger  nigger
it is right and tight  good morning let me introduce you to everybody you know my assistant sloan
i am wid it
the name of the show
it is called mantan  the new millennium minstrel show
are these our two stars sitting here in front of my nose  which one is mantan again
mantan and sleep 'n eat  two real coons  i know we are way out there but it is satire
i want you take it there  all the way to the edge and back
what are there character traits
ignorant dullwitted lazy and unlucky
and sleep 'n eat is his comical sidekick
yep you guessed it
this could be bigger than amos and andy
let'em try  i will kill to make this happen
who are the other characters
in the projects  like eddie murphy's the pj's
we think so
sleep 'n eat what do you do
i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
besides what does he know about negroes
if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot
that is exactly my point  has he even directed actors before in anything
dunwitty do not leave
we just punched it up a bit  made it funnier
this has to be a big mistake
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier  from the gitgo from jump street
hold on a sec i got a call
hello mommy let me get rid of this other call
i gots to go it is my moms
i want to meet her one day please tell her the great news  i am out like vanilla ice
i want to speak with you
go away unless you got my money
it is me peerless
it is been a long time
pull up a chair  oh excuse me this is my lady dot
pleased to meet you
daddy she is younger than me
my game is still strong  no viagra for me do not need no chemicals just my tonic
i thought you had promised mommy you stopped
how did you end up here
another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back
the same old same old  trying to get my stuff through
nuthing i cannot handle
the truth is never let them seeya sweat  you do that that is half the battle
where do you go from here
three nights charleston south carolina
i did not mean that in life
always keep 'em laughing
is that so
not that often  he was excited to see you
so he drank himself into a stuper
the drinking is for the pain  it does not kill it just dulls it
so that is up with you
your father is proud of you
he did the best way he knew how junebug is stubborn just like you
why did not you tell me about this staff meeting
nobody told me anything
what good are you if you do not tell me stuff like this
it was not my fault  if i would have known i would have known
it hit me like a ton of bricks
how can this be  you and me at the same time the exact same thought it is scary
the idea was out there in the universe  now what
do you know how you will use him
not yet but this thing will never get made
the point being that him the networks do not want black people on television unless they are buffoons
sounds risky to me
you getting cold feet
i am in till the end
good  i am going to need your support
cannot you just quit  walk away
i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show
why did you even come up with that shit if you did not want it made
that is the chances of mantan being picked up
i would not bet against it  my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place
which one is your brother
the big one
i am gonna slit my wrists  cut my throat  for the love of joseph
break a leg
let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready
we both lied to him
what do you want me to say
just do not lie to me
the pleasure is mine
i am sorry i cannot help it  it is too funny
everybody shut up
a small victory is not that small when you have been use to losing
a gift
for what
no matter what you think you did come up with something unique open it
this is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century
is that good or bad
to me it shows part of our history in this country a time when we were considered inferior subhuman
i do not want to hear it
how long have you and hambone been hanging out
you are the one that put us together we are friends
that crazy brother of yours does not think so
he is just playing big brother
oh is he  you getting jiggy with mantan
please do not go there
dunwitty and i feel you have been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
i cannot lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
do you have to be so damn forthright
that is why it will be so much fun
the first and only time  a big mistake  i am gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore
work related or otherwise
dela kiss my big black ass
and that is how you got me in the first place
i did not think this was in your studies at nyu
give me the gun
he i am mona
hi mona

i feel fine
not nervous  relaxed
sloan will you take your boss out of here so i can get ready

this is nothing  it will blow over by tomorrow
same thing giuliani said

in time
yo dela they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
what you did is dead wrong

my name is manray goddamnit
it looks delicious
you hear me talking to you  the only time you come up here when something is wrong
c'mon mommy do not start with that i am an ungrateful son stuff
i said no such thing  all i said is that something must be wrong
if at first it is not what you want just work that much harder peerless
mommy please do not call me that
peerless i did not raise a buffoon we have enough of those on television already
please let me know when you hear from daddy get a number or something
i will be right over

yes he did
where is he
he is performing at some place outside of richmond virginia
i cannot go all the way down south
i do not even know why you are still concerned over him  daddy's not with you
regardless he still is your father
it is gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
even more reason to see him  he will be overjoyed with your success
of course i am happy for you you have worked very hard for your success
yes i have very hard  has daddy called
you know how your daddy is
if and when he calls please do not forget to ask him if he is seen mantan

do not try to change to the subject
why do not you answer
i know i will not be your puppet
you can go now
i wuz leaving anyway for good
good morning
where are you bound for
that is none of your business
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel
i am not afraid of highwaymen  my man is armed and so am i
ten sir and make them short ones do you hear captain grogan
do not bully mr best  here are the pistols  god bless you my boy and when i count three fire
i never was more in earnest
the place seems more a farm than an innyard
the people are great farmers as well as innkeepers
i have acted as i think fit
sir i am a british officer
how do you do sir
not yet but i believe he intends to
the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me  do you mind that
faith i think you are a lad that is likely to keep your word
the meeting is arranged  captain best is waiting for you now
my mare is saddled and ready who's the captaings second
your cousins go out with him
i am harry james' son and will act as becomes my name and quality
oh it is with pistols we fight  you are no match for best with the sword
i will match any man with the sword
it must have been some other gate
is miss dugan well
there's only six miss dugans now poor dorothy
good heavens  whatever  has she died of grief
i have heard of them
sirrah  sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland
you are an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
repeat the words again and i run you through the body
i deny your grace's accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
i do not know
your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which i have honorably won
i will let down the steps for your honor
you are going to drive to the frontier
it is shameful  infamous  i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador's house
your honor must lower his voice
all europe shall hear of this
as you please
the gentleman has nothing contraband
yes sir  here is my letter
yes sir
you come highly recommended by herr seebach
herr seebach was a very kind employer
for whom else have you worked
no one sir  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
who else can give me information about you
only the agency of servants
have no fear  it will come out well for me
i believe they will deport you
i have faced that problem before
but if they send you away then what is to become of me
to risk one's life against such people is an imposition
i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him
certainly monseigneur does not your excellency consider her worthy of love
then you yield to me
on the instant  everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs
that is a trifle strong
take to your legs low irish dog
not even that
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
not one
have you not a man whom you value
that man has perhaps not yet been born
what  you have not met a man worthy of your attention
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more  i could value only someone whom i loved
then you have never loved  your heart is empty
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
that is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love
a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws
i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
how so
by loving you with no hope of possessing you
it is my only object
to make me wretched in two weeks
to love you until death  to subscribe to all your commands
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me  if i do not know it i am innocent
then i will respectfully take leave of her
poor man  and for that reason you want to begin where people end
i ask only a payment on account today  after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet
old fool
then you must get it
with pleasure at finding the ribbon
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best and then stroll out with him into the garden
what with me on the pillion  would you kill poor me
as much as possible
as much as possible
yes for i wish to entertain splendidly
all the same you must name an amount
it is entirely up to you  i want the best
all right five hundred guineas
by name only
yes minister i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain galgenstein
in so far as i can tell these things  no  i believe the chevalier won the money fairly
the prince left him only that choice
when is he to go
what is to be done
o'higgins mohawk o'higgins
may i be quite frank with you
yes of course
now just have a little patience my boy  your birthday is not until next week
but i will have it on my birthday will not i
well we will just have to wait and see will not we
good night my little darling
yes papa
is he all right papa
yes he is fine
in truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
the milkmaid's daughter
i beg your pardon
come come sir  i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool
blackeyed sczortarska
dark valdez
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
yes  he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
and he does not care about me
he is only curious to know who you are
if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
he loves me as i love you
will he wish to know the details of this night
it was on that night karl met his destiny and i met mine almost
that is great
i just saw the woman i am going to marry i know it but then i lost her
tough break most men have to get married before they lose their wives
i am going to spend the rest of my life looking for her that or die alone
jesus kid  let me guess real pretty blonde hair blue hat
who is she where does she live
kid do not waste your time she is out of your league
a few rabbits but i think one of them was already dead
that would explain the indigestion
thank you
good luck kid
edward bloom
not yet

i do not expect to
i will go in right now and get that eye
then do it
fine i will
fine you do it
fine i am doing it
i brought it
let's see it
i did not know she belonged to anybody
a pleasure
absolutely be good for you to talk to him
thirty years maybe more
how would you describe him
fiveeleven oneeighty regulated hypertension  how would his son describe him
a thousand times he caught an uncatchable fish
not that one the real story did he ever tell you that
what did she look like
well she uh
was she nekkid
and when i am 38 you will be 48 and that is not much difference at all
i suspect it will hurt a lot
i promise someday when i am really supposed to
how did you know
i am not convinced you should be happy
i am sorry have i offended you
i was 18 he was 28 turns out that was a big difference
i see i thank you for your time
i can get it i can just
please go just go
i will
and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die she is the only one
lucky girl
i am sorry jenny i am
i was dreaming
what were you dreaming about
no i understand
he was slipping her a little extra cream
can i take your picture
you do not need a picture just look up handsome in the dictionary

truth is i have been thirsty my whole life never really known why
you were talking about your wedding

just to be sure you can take my pack
friend of yours did you help him out of a bind

you learned from the best
the old lady by the swamp
she was a witch

i saw my death in that eye and this is not how it happens
so how does it happen
surprise ending would not want to ruin it for you

i would just like to know the true versions of things events stories you
i will
you know where the chemicals are
i used to do it when you were gone remember i used to do it a lot
i said this is not how i go the last part is much more unusual trust me on that
it is rude to talk about religion you never know who you are going to offend
oh so you know
i think someone has not
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
i have told you a thousand facts that is all i do will i tell stories
only on the surface but that is all i have ever seen
yourself good bad everything just show me who you are for once
the river
how what happens

i am going with you
did you
they met at auburn
what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that

everyone loves my father he is a very likeable guy
do you love him
what is true i have never heard my father say a single true thing
i need you on my side
i am always on your side and i think you should talk to him
your father had a stroke he is upstairs with your mom and dr bennett

we swam the atlantic it is not that big really
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport
we rented a car
you did not need to do that you just did not
he is up with your father
you do not talk about those things not yet
really that is wonderful
of course
what i mean is do you really know that is going on in his head
yes but that is a different
well clearly you do not but i am not the mystery you are trying to solve right now
no but it is weird she seemed to recognize me
do you know who that is
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
he just fell asleep josephine's with him
i suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on but we sold that right away your cousin shirley bought it

you know what i mean babe it is enough we can stop
do you want to stop

that is not a burn
it is i did it cooking
thank you
name it
what are you doing here
leave him
you have you have actually fallen for this prick
no i have not
uh yes
hang on hang on sorry but like who are you
you must find some glasses small for the toast and some plates
what are you doing here
i am asking what you are here for
he says he feels safe here
oh  we are russian
yes i know
toast first then we talk seriously i can see you are serious about us
of course not alexei he is is my problem
i asked her if you were happy to see us i find it hard to tell with you
yes it is okay thank you for the food
plans are for the architects politicians and so forth
you must have a visa or something
you are asking for my documents
no no
uh do you like england
classic  thank god she says 'yes'
oh nothing
tell me
no it is too judgmental
tell me what he said
he says why did you send to russia for a wife
no it is not that
do you believe in love
i suppose it is i mean define your terms
fine i thought you were leaving today
to be indoors on such a day it is crime
you can stay tonight
i have brought you trouble maybe i should have come alone
good night
he wants money
tell him to put the kettle down and i will give him money
i will give him money tell him to put the
he wants the money from your bank
i will fucking give it to him we will go down there
you do not understand he wants all the money that is in your bank
i have got eight hundred pounds oh jesus
he is sure you can do this of course you can not
oh jesus of course i cannot
i am so sorry
leave her alone
happy bath day
that is wrong
they go
of course they go yes yes
they go
i do not want to know
it makes it faster if i do not speak to the men they fall faster it is pretty obvious why
that is a relief it is nice to know i am a regular guy
why else would you send off for me if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
well as it turns out i did
no i do not
in the world
i know you just want to punish me 
i do i want to very badly
so you are just going to be vindictive
in every sense if at all possible
you cannot hurt me more than i am hurt already
well nadia it it is all the same to you i would like to give it a bash
what no you are not
i am going i am i am going to be sick
no you are not how nice one how dumb do you think i am 
have you got your passport
i do not have any money
i do not want to talk about him
fine absolutely must be disappointing though must come as a hell of a shock
look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
oh jesus
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
of course of course of course he does of course thank you thanks
but you know so what
he will come back
excuse me
he left me my passport and ticket it is pretty clear he wants to see me again
yeah i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too
no but you tend to tie them up
why not
shut up i am not listening
you do not want to talk about it
so that is it like having to fuck men you hate
i do not hate you
and it is wrong
and who says what is wrong
and that would be morals that would be one's own moral sense of decency
that is a moral orgasm john tell me how it feels exactly
so what then you just detach sex from everything
whereas wet 'ng wild is an emotional journey tied and tethered it is pretty moving huh like anna karenina
listen i did not go rooting around in your private stuff
sometimes neither
some what does that mean
there's nothing wrong in liking sex john
i do not like sex i do not think i will be having sex ever again
i think it is my safest bet do not you
oh i think you will recover okay i think you got what you paid for
you did not mind too much
so what did you want i think we understand each other no
you do not understand me
you do not understand you either
get out
you are throwing me out
get out
you do not have to say anything
what i i was not saying
please there's no oh
i was not saying anything
then okay  so how old were you when you met him

the rest of the world john it is not all like st albans

a snitch

he is not there huggie bear is not in every single episode
i think you might of dreamed this one anthony
no it is a real episode the killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones
see that is what i am saying it has the logic of a dream
the point is the killer always goes may i speak to starsky he says his name
what does starsky say
he says this is he
this is he
no this is he
kind of except we have already got the keys
that is true but what if they change the locks
would they do that
who knows that is why i filed it down
see your mind is very good with the more mechanical details whereas my strength would be 
she is an attractive older woman
what do you think the cops have
but dignan do you really know that much about rare coins
i know about money anthony i know the value of money plus the earrings are worth three times that
every valuable item in the house was on that list
i do not appreciate you ridiculing me
how was i ridiculing you
yeah i saw it
i am lookout
dignan it is got an alarm
i do not think so just reach on in
that sets it off
no just do it real quick  i will meet you down there
yeah i heard that
five seven eight dollars
eight dollars
that is not bad
hang on a second
just turn right here
that is a good question no i do not i am just being hypocritical here however i will say 
nothing go ahead
no dignan it is not your gun it is all of ours
you are out i am not working with either one of you
dignan stop
you are right you are right
where is the other stocker
there's another stocker right
we know there's another stocker
unlock that door  check the aisles
we got it we got it
like he meant it
like i am going to hunt you down and kill you
what do you think
anthony he sat in the car and watched a 411 in progress he got what he deserved
he was the driver dignan he did what he is supposed to do
i do not like to use that credit card dignan
why not
because my mom gets the bill
she is not going to notice anthony
i do not want to use it
well then cut it in half
i keep it for emergencies
anthony we are on the run this is an emergency it is only fair that
dignan those are not running shoes
yes they are
look at the treads on those
what about them
they obviously were not designed for racing
well those treads stink you would blow a knee out racing on those
you were spoiled rotten
i will say it
ok go ahead
on your marks  get set go
no i am not saying her i am just saying i do not know
it is a great shirt do not worry about it
i know but once you get inside you are home free
right get back to me on that one once your plan is worth a shit
it is not a plan it is just 
even if it is the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not
no we did not
jerry  and this is my associate cornelius
what that is the matter
anthony we are on the run from the law here did you tell these people your real name

do not worry about it bob
they blamed my family for everything they always said mr langston saved anthony's life

we said 48 hours
that is a long time to be in jail
this morning

if you say so
well the world is a little bit colder today
no i am going to swim i will see you later
can you hand me those french fries

dignan i cannot do that all right i just cannot
you do not know how to hotwire

yeah convert it into lofts ok pop quiz that is the single most important aspect of your job
yeah and i will tell you who we are going to want kumar banijamali
i am not really sure i think it is irish or maybe 
i guess what i am trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan

hold it
what do you mean
the abe henry doublecross test you just made a perfect score
take a deep breath
it feels good

i do not want to die
are you afraid
no bob did
bob bob that is a palindrome  i love palindromes
are you afraid to die mr henry
anthony i am petrified
can i ask you something mr henry
because i was like you once and there was no one there to help me
pot is an herb it is just like any type of gardening
it is private property plus i have hector
hector woud not do anything
but he is got a loud bark that is the most important thing is a loud bark
i do not know sure i guess
you could make your own cinnamon toast
let them fight
yeah he said that
see you bob
what was that
there's a million places to hide around here
oh yeah they will never catch the guy
i hope not
phil probably provoked him  where is he going
i do not know i personally do not need that shit in my life right now
nobody does
ok dad
he looked too shakenup
i do not know i do not know anything except phil says they got him and he is in jail
and if future man does not get let out of jail in 48 hours then we go back all right
i am not playing any more golf
why not
cause i am not getting any better it is a waste of time
you have only been playing for two weeks bob it takes a long time to learn this game
you think i am improving
yes you just got to stick with it
no i do not mind
i know it must of been a bad experience but it does not sound like it was your fault
well i did not mean to electrocute him but the whole operation was my idea
i do not like that word prank bob i was trying to do something more than a prank
prison tatoos i got to be pretty good it is not like drawing on paper
yeah but he still has the aggravation three days sitting in a cell
were you adopted bob
why do you say that
well because you guys do not look alike
no i was not adopted
jesus christ no
it was stupid
cause you would of let my brother rot in jail
hopscotch the code name is hopscotch
no i am having a heart attack of course i am ok that is that supposed to mean
nothing i was just asking
my walkie talkie's busted i cannot tell that is going on
let me see it  did you drop it
i did not do anything
his health is not very good you know they take that into account
dies y nueve
right yeah yo soy dies y nueve how old are you
god yes like silk
like silk
god that does sound corny oh your skin feels so soft and silky but it really kind of does
you are anthony
what do you mean
feel this
the front stairs
where were you
just settling an old score you might say revenge
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that will land us in jail
we might have to take that chance cause i feel pretty strongly about this
is that buckethead
wait a second
that is your friend anthony
we are going too slow it looks like we are following him
well this is not really a party per se
you do not celebrate til it is over
you are the faggot
i do not know about that
the one and only little richard
i do not know bob what about one of those
not even for emergencies
they are
so who's going to know
my brother
that never would of 
let's cut the bullshit
what are you talking about bob
can you use a coaster
yes i did
ok bob
it is true dignan
well what do you want to do you want to steal one or just drive your car
i will just drive my car
as much as i want when these plants bud i will probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed
six thousand dollars come on bob
you should take a look i have an entire crop in my backyard
good question
you are paranoid bob
yeah but do not tell anybody
i cannot believe you said that
what did i say
i told you he is crazy
i warned you dignan
you said it like it was a big joke bob like he is wild
no i was saying crazy like a lunatic
i know that now he is a fucking psycho
well do not blame me i told you
i do blame you bob and woah look at her
maybe she turned
let's just go
that is your domain
that is your fucking problem you are a shithead
i just want to see how much bullets it takes
god dammit
he electrocuted someone
yeah one of the nicest old guys you would ever know
that is too bad
you know when somebody gets electrocuted their skin starts smoking at least swifty's did
i am putting a piece of tape on my nose
shhh slow down bob drive natural
this is natural
that is good keep it at forty
did we get it
be cool bob be cool  make that light
do not count it
no i was calm
no all he will remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose
i do not want to talk about it
that is true that would give me nightmares
bob i have got nightmares
i told you they were there
so it is my fault
he would not move
i do not know
it is registered in my mother's name
what the fuck possessed you
you are the one who kept saying ram him
see you in a little while
my brother's in jail
what are you talking about
but it is not his how can they arrest future man
they said he is a drug dealer
well the marijuana crop is a good start
that could be anybody's
they also found my two beam scale in the garage
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house everybody has a scale
the cops say it is a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana
so tell them the truth what do you use it for
i was just going to use it to see how much i had
i do not know
then how come they have not set the bail yet that is unconstitutional
we will have to see when we get back
well obviously we got to go back
bob that makes no sense
dignan he is my brother i cannot just leave him there
this could be a trap
come on dignan
do not come on dignan me
i am going back
not in that car you are not
watch me
good luck since i got the keys
i cannot do that bob
dignan you are going to give me those keys or you are going to get hurt
do not threaten me bob
goddammit dignan it is my car if you do not give me my keys i swear to god 
his name's not future man dignan
i know it is not
you do not even know his name
yes i do
what is it

that is his name
that is right i only have one vote we will go talk with anthony and figure it out
let's go
not bad
come on in what you been up to
not a whole lot bob
yeah it is
i do not expect an apology and i do not even want one i just want us to 
i cannot fucking believe this guy an apology bob
man i do not want to go into this
i never agreed to that
bob you are lying
i do not want to fight you dignan
i did not have any choice
that is ok
look we want you on the job
i know it man hang on
jesus christ
yeah we are in the elevator how is it look back there

let's go
i think so
i did not think there was an alarm

no the files are spotless whatever they find it is just going to make conklin look worse
and the landy woman
one last push one
what do you mean
go to the airport get a plane i will have a brass band waiting for you
save it for bourne
bourne comes here why
that is not gonna fly
with all due respect pam i think you might have wandered a little past your paygrade
i want to know about treadstone
what are you after pam you want to fry me you want my desk is that it
i want to know what happened
dead in a ditch drunk in a bar in mogadishu who knows
excuse me
we were throwing money at him throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark
may i finish
so that is your theory  conklings reaching out from the grave to protect his good name  the man is dead
you do not know what you are getting into here
hold on  he said he wants to come in
i was not sleeping  you ok
oh god it must have been bourne
did he say anything to you
no it must have been bourne
do not know
jesus i zorn i have to call his family tell them
i am sorry ward
i would rather stand if it is all the same to you
i do not exactly know what to say  i am sorry
'why' would be enough for me
i am not a traitor i have served my ountry
and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it
why not it was just money
and danny zorn what was that
had to be done
no good options left
well you are probably right i guess that is all that hubris is
the sooner the better
is it a slam dunk no but
something's been going on here in europe and it is still going on post conklin who's been in berlin
lots of people
including landy  she had access to the archives
nobody you  i had to tell you right
show me again
i speak english
it is nothing it is just a picture
no it is because you do not know how they died
no i do
then what
i killed them
how how can how can you be here and say this
i do not want you to forgive me
you are a liar
you know i am not
you are a liar
look at me
i cannot let you do that either
because you are afraid
no  because you do not want to know how it feels
is this really happening
i am sorry

i do remember something good all the time i remember you
i worry when you get like this

the telegraph office
but we were so careful
we pushed it we got lazy
he was at the campground yesterday
no not this this is real  and he is right there 
we cannot wait to be sure
i do not want to move again i like it here
 there's places  we cannot afford to be wrong
 not yet 
 it is just him 
 yeah  one guy  i do not think he was ready 
 hang on 
where are you going
i am going to bail on the other side and wait this bridge is the only way he can follow
what if it is not who you think it is
if he crosses the bridge it is
there must be another way
i warned them marie i told them to leave us alone
jason please do not do thisit will not ever be over like this
there's no choice
tell me later
but you found another choice
i did
it would not have changed the way you feel
it might have
you do
i only dream about people who are dead
jason you know exactly what to do that is your mission now
who is pamela landy
you hear me i believed you
is she running treadstone
what is this a game
i want to hear it from you
last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national
a russian
i killed him
conklin stuff on conklin 
so when was i here
what do you mean
for treadstone in berlin you know my file i did a job here when
no you never worked berlin
my first job
your first assignment was geneva
that is a lie
you never worked berlin
i was here
i want to come in
i want someone i know to take me in
alexanderplatz 30 minutes under the world clock alone give her your phone
ramstein air base germany  before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital
are you disappointed
that is that
do you think you can read are you well enough
sounds like a threat
you did not answer my question
i am working on it
who's going us
there's only a consulate they sent a field officer out half an hour ago 
then get a number they need to know who they are dealing with
 uplink all relevant files to kim    and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone 
 the hotel  how far 
i want to look at the room  check it out
but we can relax we tracked him he is on a train to moscow
what the tapes
hold on  yep and abbott just direct dialed moscow from his room
is there is all there
 no  not me  no other people 
 shut up  just shut the 
that is where we came out
it is a lot of money pam
we are talking raw unprocessed kgb files it is not something we can go out and comparison shop
who's this
pamela landy again where do we stand
me four years
yes sir  ma'am
depression anger compulsive behaviors they had physical symptoms  headaches  sensitivity to light 
you were his local contact you were with him the night conklin died you are coming with us
are you an expert in amnesia
look what do you want me to say i was there i believed him
believed what
i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown
so he fooled you
if you say so
you felt nothing no spark two young people in paris dangerous missions life and death
you mean did i want a date
did you
these were killers conklin had them all jacked up they were dobermans
some women like dobermans 
what do you want from me i was reassigned i am out
and why is that
because he is doing just what he said he would do he is coming for us
it is got caffeine in it that is all i know
i do not know he was sick he wanted out i believed him
yup  the main word there the file heading translates as treadstone
what the hell is a treadstone
are we locked up
his wife in room 645 then she shot herself 
alright i want you kurt and kim to stay on bourne track everything that is out there
yes in that order
and what about you anything
we just had a funeral is not that what it means in england as well
then we will just have a peek at the wounds  dig 'em up
did not want your father to die either did ya but it happened
it was in latin sir
saying goodbye in their own way  in outlawed tartans with outlawed pipes playing outlawed tunes
i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground
invade that is impossible it 
we must sue for peace
with cavalry  not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ  we could outmaneuver their bowmen
it is suicide
you have all sworn to longshanks
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here
no but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything the balliols will kiss his ass so we must
he was a modest man
it will not be long before longshanks too is encased in stone and his crowns divided for others to wear
homage is nothing it is the crown that matters
the crown is that of scotland and scotland is william wallace
he will i know he will
i hear this wallace is a bandit nothing more
nothing new majesty we have sent riders to speed any word
impossible  how dare you bring a panicky lie
so the scots will have none of them will they my armorers have already made a thousand
the scots will fight for us
what choice do they have now they must serve us or starve
but if we have not caught wallace 
you let wallace escape your whole army you cannot blame me for this
you directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended
so i did and what was so important about it
scotland he intends 
his majesty was quite keen that you should understand 
all so very boring he wants me to learn to fight too so let me do it
look at me i said look at me
yes i had thought that i was loathsome to you perhaps i am if i may be excused m'lord
you may
you mock us with a smile
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion
wallace's followers
wallace's for treason there is no trial tomorrow he will be charged then executed
you fancy him
hamish i thank
mornay has come so will the bruce
we are here to stay we do not care to live if we cannot fight beside ya
i rest
your rest is making me exhausted
probably but we cannot win alone we know that this is the only way
i do not want to be a martyr
we have lived a dream together a dream of freedom
no one of us is enough
how many
three maybe more
with your father and brother gone they will kill us and burn the farm
it is up to us hamish
i wanna have supper waiting
we will get those english pigs tomorrow
aye we will get 'em
you win
that depends on the man
i could crush you like a roach
i will not
i should'a remembered the eggs
a patriot
we do not split up
they used hounds on us in ireland it is the only way
he was so brave with courage alone he nearly won
so more men were slaughtered uselessly
he broke because of me i saw it he lost all will to fight
all men lose heart all betray it is exactly why we must make the choices we make
your pardon m'lord he asked me to come in his stead
shall i leave m'lord
if he wants his queen to rule then you stay and learn how i will deal with him
no he did not
then why does he stay my scouts say he has not advanced
a mindless barbarian not a king like you m'lord
this is what happens when you must send a woman and a fool
forgive me sire i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule
my greatness is better demonstrated with this
let her speak
he will fight you forever but what does he fight for freedom first and peace so grant them
against thy king thou vile fool hast thou anything to say
never in my whole life did i swear allegiance to your king 
it matters not he is thy king
thank you for inviting
i will invite you again but your mother thinks i am crazy
you are and i will come again
no you do not choose your dreams your dreams choose you
i accept your proposal
i am not just saying it
nor i
but i will not give you up to any nobleman
you scare me
i do not want to scare you i want to be yours and you mine every night like this one
this night is too beautiful to have again
i will be with you like this forever
shush it is only been a day  and it is seemed like forever
tonight then
my parents are growing suspicious i cannot keep meeting you every night
yes you are and you must wake
i do not want to wake i want to stay with you
and i with you but you must wake
i need you so much i love you
wake up william wake up
last night i slept with a member of the war council
he should not be telling secrets in bed
ah oui englishmen do not know what a tongue is for
wife of edward the king's son
it is battle i want not talk
but now that i am here will you speak with a woman
i have been given nothing god makes men what they are
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities the executioner of the king's nephew my husband's own cousin
peace is made is such ways
slaves are made in such ways
because of the way you are looking at me now the same way as when we met
every man dies not every man really lives
and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less
and i will consult with mine
they have tricked us
that is the crazy man saying lord
the dogs have a scent my scent someone must have given it to them
who would do such a thing
no english lord would trust an irishman
bring out our spearmen and set them in the field
aye but it will not let me dream
i am sorry but can it wait til tonight i am already late for work 
what is it
not according to his teacher it just got me thinking about jason and what if evangs inherited his father's condition
why what for
unfortunately we have got nothing to work with it is harder playing detective now
but you must have something to go on
if i had to guess i would say the blackouts are stress related
but he is seven what kind of stress can he have
you would be surprised how often they are
well he has been pushing me to meet his father but i have been putting it off
nine ten and you are awake open your eyes dammit
so what did you find
the hemorrhaging the neural damage is irreparable i am frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions
when did you ever care about getting to school on time
we are putting up pictures for parent's night
thanks do not worry evan you will have plenty of time
um can dad come this time
you know the answer to that
cannot he come out for one day
we have been over this a hundred times it is too dangerous for him
but lenny said that his dad's coming and tommy and kayleigh's dad
i get the point kiddo but i am not so bad am i
my father has a bad memory too
great i will see you soon
honey what were you doing with that
i i do not remember
something must have happened what set him off
i i blacked out
do not try to use your blackouts to get out of this one
what what could he do
i do not know these things take time
how is kayleigh doing she all right
damn it mom i told you i need them all
cute evan
you told me that on parents' weekend remember wait that was not me or you
do not worry i am gonna get you out of here
can you protect me
straight up
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose for you to help me
shit i knew you were crazy
i ai not bullshitting jesus speaks to me in my dreams
you need to see the prison shrink man
weirder than this
marks scars i dunno anything could happen i guess
signs of the lord they just appeared out of nowhere i thought you were loco
so you believe me
you know my father
not in this wing actually no
i am standing next to kayleigh my hands are over her ears
are you hurting her
no protecting her
i see a car
i cannot the car vanishes and all of a sudden i am on the ground in the woods
are you sure not even with my father
lemme guess would that be where the memories are stored
where are my goddamn books
but i i need those books
you remind me of your father he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one
i thought you were a december baby
this is bigger seven years to the day no blackouts
that is probably why hannibal lecter's so smart
all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories
shhh i need quiet for this
sorry dude just figured it would be okay with you being sick and all
so let's go this place creeps me out
shit lenny that is happened to you we have gotta get help
you really do not remember anything that happened
damn your dad did this
he is been acting real strange lately he will not even look me in the eyes anymore
duck here they come
he must be they are letting him go right
hi lenny
oh comme si comme ca you know
no evan i do not know it is been a long time fill me in
i am going to state now things are going okay i guess mom's good
i have stopped a hundred times
so how is tommy
they kept him in juvy for a few years now he works over at dale's autobody
wow that must have taken some courage
not if you remember my dad
could not you have moved in with your mom
me are you kidding why
remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts
of course
when we were kids your dad was making a movie robin hood or something
what do you want to know evan
it is just did he what happened in the basement
it was a long time ago
i know but
is that why you came all the way back to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood
no but i think something really bad might have happened to us
you cannot hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak
mmmm you give good compliment clean up and come back to bed
those are your clothes silly
so it did not feel weird
yeah if you call multiple orgasms weird
you will see
go on sit down
might'a been nice  like this is gonna do any good maybe one of the frat guys has a gun
it is not his fault evan you knew how bad he had it when we were kids
do not give me this oprahbook club bad upbringing shit because you turned out fine
my father never laid a hand on me it is like the prick saved it all up for tommy
what do you mean
it is just you have been acting kinda strange you know
like how
i cannot put my finger on it but everything's a bit off even the dinner tonight it was beautiful but
he is a fucking maniac

do you remember when i was a kid and i had those blackouts
shit i dunno how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that

my husband is with me too
he is well captain renault's getting broadminded sit down will you have a drink
oh he is just like any other man only more so
no i mean is he trustworthy is his word 
 now just a minute who told you to ask me that
he did captain renault did
i thought so where is your husband
at the roulette table trying to win enough for our exit visa well of course he is losing
he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
does he know that
oh yes
and he is still willing to give you a visa
yes monsieur
and you want to know 
 will he keep his word
he always has
oh yes please
go back to bulgaria
 he is just a lucky guy
thank you but i hardly think 
 then perhaps for the lady the ring is quite unique
berger norwegian and at your service sir
i am sorry it is
yes monsieur
a champagne cocktail please
in a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
we read five times that you were killed in five different places
no thanks carl
monsieur rick
how long can i afford to stay closed
oh two weeks maybe three
maybe i will not have to a bribe has worked before in the meantime everybody stays on salary
oh thank you herr rick sacha will be happy to hear it i owe him money
i will then i am going to the meeting of the 
 do not tell me where you are going
i will not
come up here a minute
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance it might attract the police
but sacha always puts out that light 
 tonight he forgot
yes i come i will do it
yes sir
well i will get it from the safe
i am so upset monsieur rick you know i cannot understand 
 forget it emil mistakes like that happen all the time
i am awfully sorry
it shall not happen again monsieur
that is all right
er good luck yes
i would better be going
er my check please
i have to warn you sir i beseech you
it has been a pleasure to meet you
hello ferrari how is business at the blue parrot
fine but i would like to buy your cafe
it is not for sale
you have not heard my offer
it is not for sale at any price
what do you want for sam
i do not buy or sell human beings
suppose we ask sam maybe he would like to make a change
suppose we do
my dear rick when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy
no hurry i will have it sent over have a drink with me
you are a fat hypocrite you do not feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
so could i and i am a poor businessman
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
i will tell him when he comes in
rick i will put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
well you are in good company renault and strasser probably think so too
rick do not be a fool take me into your confidence you need a partner
it is certainly not good enough but since i am in a hurry it will have to do
and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i do not sell
of course they stay rick's would not be rick's without them
well so long
i shall remember to pay it to myself
those letters were not found on ugarte when they arrested him
not for sure monsieur but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick
good day
you need not be concerned about me
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
that is also true except for one destination to return to occupied france
occupied france
uh huh under a safe conduct from me
what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
there are only two other alternatives for him
what are they
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
and the other alternative
my dear mademoiselle perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap good night mademoiselle
how nice you remembered but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris
not an easy day to forget
yes i put that dress away when the germans march out i will wear it again
i will
there's still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam
he has not played it in a long time
we said no questions
here's looking at you kid
in america they would bring only a penny i guess that is about all they are worth
i am willing to be overcharged tell me
and i was wondering
why there is no other man in my life
uh huh
that is easy there was he is dead
i am sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions
well only one answer can take care of all our questions
i am on their blacklist already their roll of honor
it is the gestapo they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow
yeah it is pretty bad timing where were you say ten years ago
ten years ago let's see  yes i was having a brace put on my teeth where were you
looking for a job
ah that is the new german 77 and judging by the sound only about thirtyfive miles away
i know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened
no no no no we must leave
yes of course we 
 the train for marseilles leaves at five o'clock i will pick you up at your hotel at fourthirty
no no rick not tonight
especially tonight
huh you understand how i feel how long was it we had honey
i did not count the days
has it got a wow finish
i do not know the finish yet
well go on tell it maybe one will come to you as you go along
it does not matter
i do not think i will rick
why not after all i got stuck with a railway ticket i think i am entitled to know
no rick no you see victor laszlo is my husband and was even when i knew you in paris
the stairs from the street
you use richard again we are back in paris
i went through all that with your husband it is no deal
i am not fighting for anything anymore except myself i am the only cause i am interested in
 i would not bring up paris if i were you it is poor salesmanship
please please listen to me if you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth 
i do not have to i have got them right here
put them on the table
now i do not know i know that i will never have the strength to leave you again
and laszlo
i wish i did not love you so much
no not yet
but it is all right is not it you were able to arrange everything
everything is quite all right
oh rick
because you are getting on that plane
i do not understand what about you
i am staying here with him until the plane gets safely away
but what about us
hello miss ilsa i never expected to see you again
yes ma'am a lot of water under the bridge
some of the old songs sam
yes ma'am
i do not know i ai not seen him all night
not tonight no more he ai not coming uh he went home
does he always leave so early
leave him alone miss ilsa you are bad luck to him
play it once sam for old time's sake
i do not know what you mean miss ilsa
play it sam play as time goes by
oh i cannot remember it miss ilsa i am a little rusty on it
will not you join us
victor i am afraid for you
we have been in difficult places before have not we
be careful
i will do not worry
please ilsa do not be hasty
no victor no
and as far away from major strasser as possible
we will discuss it later
victor please do not go to the underground meeting tonight
i must besides it is not often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife
he suggested i ask you
ask me
yes he said ask your wife i do not know why he said that
i know how it is to be lonely  is there anything you wish to tell me
no victor there is not
i love you very much my dear
 you do not even have to say it i will believe goodnight dear
of course i will be careful
yes i am ready  goodbye rick god bless you
rick who's he
mademoiselle you are in rick's and rick is 
 is what
oh you have already met rick mademoiselle
 this is mr laszlo
you are saying this only to make me go
how do you do
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
and about victor laszlo everywhere
will not you join us for a drink
what for
your work
thank you i try
we all try you succeed
not at all
any time
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table
good evening you see here we are again
i take that as a great compliment to sam  i suppose he means to you paris of well happier days
go ahead
well is not there some other place it is rather confidential what i have to say
my office
is not it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
yes i found that a very expensive hobby too but then i never was much of a businessman
i appreciate it but i do not accept it
i will raise it to two hundred thousand
my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
there must be some reason why you will not let me have them
there is i suggest that you ask your wife
i beg your pardon
i said ask your wife
my wife
thank you
had a close one eh
yes rather
apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause well i am also a human being
oh save it we have still lots of things to do
keep it you will need it in america
but we made a deal
oh never mind about that you will not have any trouble in lisbon will you
no it is all arranged
good i have got the letters right here all made out in blank
all except one thing there's something you should know before you leave
monsieur blaine i do not ask you to explain anything
here it is
yes what is it you want
very well
no two champagne cocktails please
this is a very interesting cafe i congratulate you
ilsa i do not wish to be the one to say it but it is late
we will be there
i slept very well
that is strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca
may we proceed with the business
with pleasure will not you sit down
thank you
well perhaps i shall like it in casablanca
i was in a german concentration camp for a year that is honor enough for a lifetime
 thank you
by the way monsieur last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte
nothing important but may i speak to him now
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
this is hardly the time or the place
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefect's office with mademoiselle
captain renault i am under your authority is it your order that we come to your office
good day
thank you captain it is very good to be here
major strasser my aide lieutenant casselle
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
realizing the importance of the case my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects
i have already heard about this cafe and also about mr rick himself
good evening captain
champagne and a tin of caviar
may i recommend veuve cliquot '26 a good french wine
thank you
i expected no less captain
how do you do mr rick
well personally major i will take what comes
do you mind if i ask you a few questions unofficially of course
how about new york
you were not always so carefully neutral we have a complete dossier on you
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that he is just another blundering american
but we must not underestimate american blundering i was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
my dear major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
but i have no excuse to close it
find one
victor laszlo is on that plane
ask monsieur rick
how extravagant you are throwing away women like that someday they may be scarce
when it comes to women you are a true democrat
why that is in lisbon
the clipper to america
and what in heavengs name brought you to casablanca
my health i came to casablanca for the waters
waters what waters we are in the desert
i was misinformed
what again
this is no ordinary arrest a murderer no less
i stick my neck out for nobody
a wise foreign policy
yeah have a brandy
victor laszlo
victor laszlo
well he is succeeded in impressing half the world
manages what
his escape
oh but i just told you 
 stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
this is the end of the chase
twenty thousand francs says it is not
i just paid out twenty i would like to get it back
make it ten i am only a poor corrupt official
why two
he is traveling with a lady
he will take one
it does not matter there is no exit visa for him
louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
because my dear ricky i suspect that under that cynical shell you are at heart a sentimentalist
the winning side would have paid you much better
maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
i have my orders
oh i see gestapo spank
excuse me
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich
i was born in new york city if that will help you any
 hello ilsa
 thanks i will
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
well it looks like you are a little late
yeah why
why do you interfere with my little romances
put it down as a gesture to love
i am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
what friend
then release him you be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves
i will make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor's pen

you do not find it depressing that homer wells is picking apples
dr homer wells

she died of *secrecy* she died of *ignorance*
i will tell them fuzzy was adopted

she *did* love him  how many women have you known
she was torn apart she died of a broken heart
oh sure
well she was in a weakened condition  i do not know what about king kong is that medically possible
you think maybe i was  i love this place
yes and no when you come here you do not really care about the movie
i did not say that growing up in an orphanage you are always lonely you are just never alone
i miss things i miss people  i miss reading to the boys
but you had so much *responsibility*
i never *asked* for any responsibility
just a little privacy
did you come here with wallyto *not* watch movies
ahha  so what is thata radio
the *speaker* for the movie sound
you just cuddle you come to hug to kiss you do not *come* here to watch the movie
that is what *i would* come here for i would watch the movie
not with the right girl you would not
it will be okay
*what* will be okay
we have to wait and see i think that for *everything* in life you have to wait and see
i am just waiting and seeing like you said
i grew up with wally i began my adult life with him

no that is not all there is to it i love you tooi *know* i do
okay okayi know you do too
it is a good thing i did not have that baby is not it
well we have to help her

you do not understand it is her father
mr rose *knows*
he is the *father* he is her baby's father
we have got to keep her away from that bastard
no nothing is nothing i want wally to come home i am afraid to see him too
i know  is *that* nothing
no do notthat is something nothing is nothing  do not even look at me i want
you got up you *did* something if you keep this up you might be in danger of making a *decision*
for god's sake homer wally's been shot down
he is *paralyzed*
he is *alive* he still loves you  so do i
what do you want me to *do*
no that is not iti just want to be sure i understand you
did well okay

and now that wally's coming back and because he will certainly *need* you
you say that as though it is some awful thing  i never stopped loving wally
she knows how to take care of herself
i am sorry for what i said about wally needing you it was unnecessary
no i am the one who should be sorry you have every right to be angry
no you warned me i did not listen but you warned me

homer was born *here* in what was it 1922
graduated bowdoin college 1935 and harvard school of medicine 1939
well we can only guess about that edna they *are* against the law
but what about school records homer does not have any *diplomas*
he probably does not make much money picking appleshe must have had to pay to send them too
i would not worry edna that he does not have money if he gets hungry he can pick his dinner
edna come dance with me let's be foolish tonight
does he *know* he is supposed to be in india does he even *want* to come back
cirrhosisit is a disease of the liver

tough day
oh god i am overbearing and rude lily lily finn
no no nothing like that i work in a bank
really wish we had met eight hours ago
you are welcome i was just going to ask you if you would like to join us
i envy you guys taking a chance like that
what do i do i am the vp of finance
well typically speaking they are not as long as you can demonstrate 
a capacity for gross fund recovery yeah we got that part
that is right and tech firms they 'tend to scare people off
they scare people off because most people lack vision vision and balls present company excluded of course
banks need to know how they are going to get their money back
we know exactly how we are going to make the money back there in lies the catch22
i do not follow
yes that is why i wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little
everything looks in order
this has to happen fast
i know it will not go unnoticed
there will be red flags
you need some convincing consider it a convincer
you are worried about recouping the loan i already told you
the standard ten
ten percent of how much
two million
jake right uhhuh uhhuh yeah it is going through 
gordo plays the inside you are the shill
yeah but come on all i get to do is cry and get insulted
know who i am jake
the antichrist
no i am not the antichrist or the prince of darkness i am just a guy looking for some answers
gee what makes you say that
your life flashing before your eyes
just the last three weeks
that is not a bad place to start
it is all about the money is not it
is not it always
you never know when you can use a crooked cop
keep going i want to know how you got lionel dolby
so you want to know how to play the big con
in this case you might say i want to know how not to play the big con
that was it we had our crew now we needed the mark
factors that were not clear to me until now
luck's a funny thing especially the bad
like what
i was doing it for them
after you cut her loose
she walked
today started off great
probably safe in the hands of the federal government
like putting on a play guess some people forgot their lines
guess so
so why do not you take a deep breath jake and i will count to ten one two three
and how much did you say you wanted for this what did you call it a finder's fee
fine but only if we recover the cash
come on
we are going to give him the money back
alright let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second is this the best thing to do
it is not like she is a real redhead jake
so far masters of our own demise what bank are you with
let's go jake
so what we just stay clear of him
jake i mean come on 
but you will not get that splatter effect
that is a lot of cash he came up with it pretty quick
i just do not know if this says me that is the fabric
and what about big al
leave him someone's going to find him eventually then they will start looking for us too
yes her where is my wallet
two million
we get fifty percent and we get clear of the king
we pay better
no not whatever you are either in or you are out
she is up for it
you sure
and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow
eight am flight
that is it
i would like this cashed please
what no use the bathroom on the plane
minus one
of course your line of work's only as good as the people you find
you cannot cheat an honest man
you cannot cheat an honest man but a man like lionel dolby

right that checks out here
i read that with a quantum increase of seven
what flickering light
the one on unit oh i think it is gmr twelve zero zero
oh that is wrong now
i am not sure i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship though
i hope it is not the oven again
look bomb
i think he is talking to it
key key what is the key
no no the key the key to the fail safe lock
the key
where is it what did you do with it
i do not have it i do not know where it is
you must have it you idiot we can stop the bomb
christ twenty seconds christ
where is the key
we are gonna die boiler we are gonna die
oh god
it did not go off
boiler we are alive my heart
doolittle are you there
it is talby he is drifting away from the ship without his jetpack
yoo hoo bomb
time to start talking
not much nothing at all in this sector
find me something i do not care where it is
well i show a 95% probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula
fuck that shit
well it is kind of a long shot
so do not give me any of that sentient life crap find me something i can blow up
pinback throw me the chart log
he just likes it up in the dome that is all
i read the same here
 open quantum latches 
can you beat that i always knew talby was weird
talby can you read me
swell let's synchronize detonation time do you know when you are supposed to go off
detonation in six minutes twenty seconds
arm yourself bomb
energy shielding positive function
do you remember the detonation time
detonation in twenty minutes
right that synchronizes here okay bomb arm yourself
you will not consider another course of action for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you
hello bomb
false data can act only as a distraction therefore i shall refuse to perceive you
hey bomb
the only thing which exists is myself
in the beginning there was darkness and the darkness was without form and void
and i saw that i was alone
of course
are you willing to entertain a few concepts
i am always receptive to suggestions
fine think about this one then how do you know you exist
but how do you know you exist
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
hmm well i think therefore i am
that is good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me
that is it
intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
why do not you have more time
because i must detonate in seventy five seconds
to explode of course
and you can only do it once right
that is correct
and you would not want to explode on the basis of false data would you
of course not
well then you have already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
yes well
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
i recall distinctly the detonation order my memory is good on matters like these
nine seconds
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
i have no proof that it was false data
you have no proof that it was correct data
mafhkin oble groop
ah what was that again i still cannot hear you
i said i am trying to reach talby something's wrong with the damn intercom i need a lastminute diameter approximation
i will check it
your ghf reading is minus fifteen

waves would be peaking really high and glassy hit that water riding the wall just perfect
somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits

i really think i should try and locate it immediately might be something important

yes talby what is it
sh talby do not bother me now
ah well i think i have found the malfunction sir i am in the emergency air lock

ben this is business just work

maybe you should think about yourself for once you always let this guy push you round 
we got what we wanted that is enough
i know i know i am just worried about what he wants speaking of which
external srbs orbital system engines its just like the shuttles you flew in 
i am sure he is matured since then
five times
i had it at four
this makes five
he is made a few changes
this is your dream reed you should be the one up there
victor's better at these things
ben this is serious turn around
three days i was worried about you how are you feeling

really with a name like von doom never saw that one coming
hey i am mr sensitivity now  clear the way wide load coming through
and they are changing into
i do not really know a compound organicmetallic alloy stronger than titanium or carbon steel harder than diamonds 
like the shields reed said would protect us  how long
at this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks 
what do you mean complete
that is terrible news
so are you
i mean you feel a little feverish
i have never felt better in my life when do you get off work

not this again 
no you are on fire
what about you
ben ben
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna
cool what would it do to you guys
ben are you there
you have been working out
what he is trying to say is every team needs a mascot
oh it is
this place is deluxe you got cable
and figure out how to reverse them let me show you to your rooms
i can go hotter
what are you trying to say just because i dress well and like to dance 
what no i am trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms
they are not costumes
but all these people
keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool
please tell me you go silent too
okay mom
i think that thing is ben
grow up johnny you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
is that a trick question c'mon i cannot be the only one who thinks this is cool
you were at 4000 kelvin any hotter you are approaching supernova 
dude that is my sister
you gave us names what are you the face of the fantastic four now
blockhead started it
at least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project
look around sis she is not here so you can stop talking to me like i am your little boy 
no i am sorry for pushing you out
sis let me take care of you for once
but johnny you cannot fly
and if he is not
reed's always right good thing he does not always know what he is got
it is not just the money i could make money in my sleep
then what is it
history leonard history everything else is conversation  how is the other matter
recording sir we see you perfectly
stable we are looking at low twenties it is a good number considering the fallout from 
reed's disaster you know i half think he did this to me on purpose
sir i am sure he would not put himself 
and that is a good thing
later first i have got some unfinished business a deal that needs closing
front page
top left like you asked  today wall street tomorrow who knows maybe washington
never better
i was talking about us working together
it is been changed
great minds think alike
yes thanks
that is good that is uh good
you always had a way with words  i should be getting back
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship 
which was
what what do you mean you 
sue look at your hands
let's not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap
what  oh
that is what we are here to find out
if it happened to him then it could
excuse me
okay is there any way to duplicate that feeling some memory or
i am sure i can come up with something
are you kidding
no i distinctly remember you walked out my door ergo
i think it was a little more complicated than 
i just wanted to share an apartment what was so complicated about that
and reverse the mutations 
curing countless diseases not just ours
of course of course
and you sure you can control this thing last time did not work out so well
with the right energy we can stabilize the storm maybe tie into the city grid
no way to know without more tests experiments
he was going to take away all my data equipment 
better than your life victor's not the one who has to get into that thing we are
every variable but yourself you do not eat sleep you cannot live in your head like 
i am not the only one in there i got you vic ben johnny all rattling around in there
reed shh just be quiet and look up
you were
i gave him twenty
why did not you say something
that would have kinda defeated the purpose and reed  i am saying it now
reed stop you need to rest your 
the power i need more power to control the storm 
you need a doctor
i am sure i can come up with something
a gasket reed we are at a party
not at all
the number's seventyfive and it is applications and patents
so reel him in but we came here to do a job so let's do it quickly
reed we are running out of time
it is too late for him and soon it will be too late for all of us
ben did this
ben did this
he is had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud and he is not the only one
not much we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage
i ruined with all due respect i told you to abort 
what i should have done a long time ago applications and patents reed this all belongs to me
i think you both know my director of genetic research susan storm

across the board sir
so i will get a fair shot
you will get everything you want o'neil  let's see if you want what you are gonna get
you making friends with the press lieutenant
permission to evaporate o'neil
i do not see how o'neil  dismissed
i am not sure what 
would you have the discretion to end it right then and there
basically  he asked me if i could unring a bell
no problem sir
entering my scan now
smoke her
i ai not gonna shoot her
only blanks  lemme do it
hey  ai not your call man
fuck me
o'neil  our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there  you know that do not you
i will act surprised
congress and the pentagon share a lot of plumbing  they will never know whose leak it is
she made it through sere training  got a call this morning from 
madam senator this is an internal document of the us navy  i must seriously question whether 
yes i see your signature right here  twice the size of everyone else's  and your conclusion was pilot error hmm
i am really not prepared for any kind of indepth review of 
i would like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything mr hayes
thank you ma'am  um may i ask what this is regarding
yes dear
would i be the only one  the only woman
hmmm  maybe i will ask when i see you in person

lieutenant thomas wickwire
sounds familiar
it should  you nominated him for specrecon just three days after you nominated me
jordan  might we do this over lunch tomorrow  i do very much want to talk but now is scarcely 
did you set me up  did you set me up just to see me fail
absolutely not
should probably ask him that
if i have to ask again senator i will be asking in front of cameras
in face i do  roper harris gallop  they all come back the same
i have had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began  and that is quite verifiable
i am sure it is
you will think about my offer
you know i wonder what the secnav would think about it  if i spoke with him
i would go special reconnaissance every bit as tough  and we have a 60 percent dropout rate among the men
then i suggest we start there
it is really f lee montgomery  but that gets whittled down to just flea  for short ma'am
so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size
no ma'am
do that
'snot me  it is him
fuck  basherbasher this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction stand by for a prc fix

every class has its surprises pyro this one will be no different
i have had it  just because they pay me like a babysitter does not mean i am gonna be one
she is a trainee just like the others  why are you coming down so hard
she is an officer  there's a higher standard
she is a women and that is why you are riding her bareback
i think you probably would  if you did not know i was right
not doing them very fine o'neil
i will try anyway sir
you will try what we tell you to try o'neil  go regulation
the chief was granted early retirement as of 17hundred yesterday  by 18hundred he was gone  out of the navy

you are the analyst for east china o'neil  analyze
unless you whiskey run
blank faces here o'neil
only four minutes to neutral waters sir  why not
thank you sir  we hear back from the pentagon
probably hear back from cnn first
hate this part  just sweating it out on the sidelines
intel has its own glory lieutenant  no matter how subtle
just like you would be
specrecon  those guys are world class warriors  and they will not want you there jordan
i take it you do not either  feet
this has nothing to do with you
well guess i do not even need to be here
get your dick back here  it has everything to do with you
you are such a ballbreaker sometimes  especially at night

i will try to keep the door open  if you wash out i make it so that 
wai' wait  what happens if it works  four months of training three years of operational duty what then
it is hard to find time to sleep royce  much less keep up with my phone life

big symbols make big targets jordan  i think someone's gunning for you
you know royce i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too
i am only trying to warn you in case 
still cannot make up your mind huh gotta go royce
jordan  you watch your ass
sure  i will join the crowd
and this class officer wickwire  you think he was just trying to get even  striking back for
no shortage of suspects
the chief  or maybe even turrentine  your co
it is done with royce  let it go
someone screwed you over like this left unanswered charges hanging over your head and you are not gonna fight back
what about him
instructors typically pull three year assignments  this guy's in and out in one year  your year  that sound right
sounds like an amazing coincidence
or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the navy
i do not know i do not care
yeah  me too
yes jordan  i will wait for you no matter how long
well now i feel so much better

 maintenance facility

then how did he find out about the device
our former commander was not strong
former commander
i am sorry you deserve to be shown
it is the tothian mine field left standing from the great war of 12185
you what what are you talking about

well sort of
but there it is
a model only as big as this
but inside i have seen
and determination
wh where are we
twenty third quadrant of gamma sector  i can show you on a map

i know what a marker is
why do i have to keep looking at you
i want you to
you gonna get rough now threaten me i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken
karen it is a pleasure how you doing
i mean the way you told it to me start at the beginning we see how the story line develops
that is right as a matter of fact
well since leo's name was on the passenger list
i said i had an idea that is all
the shylock he is barely mentioned and it is not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast
wait a minute you are not the guy are you the dry cleaner
you mean leo
you would not be talking to me if you were
i am not the guy harry
but you work for the casino
what i did till recently  after i get done here i will think about what i am gonna do next
not really
what does that mean
maybe a few times i have
ever shot anybody
i have been picked up a couple times loan sharking racketeering but i was never convicted i am clean
racketeering that covers a lot of ground does not it
for a movie
a blockbuster but quality no mutants or maniacs this one's gonna be my driving miss daisy
that is it called
mr lovejoy
mr lovejoy that is the title
it is not bad when you know what it is about
martin weir he played the mob guy that turned snitch in the cyclone
one of his best parts
no his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt whitney
ride the clouds good picture
heart attack apparently they brought a couple hookers along
i am not gonna pop her harry
just a thought
harry i probably know 'em better than you do
what do you get out of this
let's see how we get along
i had to tell 'em something
never say anything unless you have to
hey harry
yeah chili hi  you are fifty feet in the air
get the fuck outta my chair
cash it happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport
i mean at least bo's invested in three of my movies
a meeting with who you and karen
you have it
who the fuck is momo jesus these fucking names
do not waste your time harry the guy's not much of a movie fan now c'mon gimme the key
he died
how would you know he died he tell you
what get away jet
it was in the herald
yeah well maybe the guy took out flight insurance check with the wife
bullshit eg is short for 'ergo'
ask your man here
twenty seven hundred
you know marty you were good in the cyclone
no i do not though i have to say i am curious
so you want to know
if you would like to tell me yeah
i am thinking of a movie
one of mine
one we are producing
with what wiseguy money
what happened the pressure got to you
pressure i am the one applied the pressure
martin look at me
i am looking at you
what you are telling me you are tired you wanna go to bed
wait how about this
now you are squinting like you need glasses
that is not bad
that is what i think of you asshole nothing
i believe it
i turn it on when i confront the guy
yeah but you have not found him yet  the guy took off for las vegas
how do i know that
goodlooking too  like karen
you are not going to tell me the rest
yeah i like it i am high up i can see everything you know it is the cadillac of minivans
that is that
that is not bad i think you got it down
you are here a while that is wrong with a bank
they report it to the irs
you do not open an account leo you put it in a safe deposit box dip in whenever you want
i am up twelve grand today
from when you left vegas with four fifty
who told you that
here's another tip
how by taking my money
you can keep what you won today that is yours
it is all mine
sit down leo
at eighteen percent okay and do not ask me no more fucking questions i am leaving
i will find you leo
i know who he works for where is your phone
you broke in
no it was open it was not locked
what if it was
that is right three percent
but a week that is a hundred and fifty percent a year
what are you doing here
i wanted to come by apologize for coming into your house like i did last night
lemme get this straight you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before
rough day on the set
i spent all day crawling out of a grave the costumer kept bitching 'cause i was ripping my nylons 
ripped nylons work makes the shot more real
that is what we finally decided
like in bride of the mutant when you played the whole end with that torn top
for any movie
i married martin that was a full time job
you read harry's new one he says it is the best thing he is ever read
he must mean after slime creature 3
that why harry came over last night see if you could help him get martin in his movie
do not go out of your way
right see how your story ends
i just caught the end
i already read it harry left a copy at the house
what do you think
i do not like the title or the main guy's name
then you have read it
not yet
you and harry will make a great team  i am gonna make a deal with him
there a part in it for you
what do you get out of it
i want to know
why does anyone want to be in movies
yesterday you were a loan shark
you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant
yeah we understand you read the script and like it a lot
the guy's setting you up you pulled out of their freaks deal so he is paying you back
depends who pays
not unlike the way nicki met him except it was a wrap party why
i do not know i am just having some trouble seeing you two together
you do not like martin much do you
how about get shorty except that is not a movie that is real life
how about chili's hollywood adventure
you thought i was faking
no i do not mean that i just meant in general
whichever let's talk about it tomorrow
what happened
continental but it does not matter martin will not order from the menu
yeah harry you look like you belong in one of your horror movies
he is doing the same thing you did to him playing letterman on tv
it is not dave it is a movie
are you going down
i do not know
you are as bad as harry
i will go i will go
guy's got a fucking pink toilet for christ's sake
oh shit i am sorry i thought that was i am so sorry
you bet
you do not act like it
i was scared then not now how long you want me to be scared
go get your stuff
could not find my toothbrush
yeah the guy owes momo a few g's
what i am thinking is maybe momo could buy it
that is what the guy said
tomorrow i see on the tv weather it is gonna be nice and warm you will not need the coat
in an armchair or i go to a coffee shop sleep there sit in a booth pull my hat down
do not say a fucking word
no you just broke his fucking nose instead
he already knew it
yeah well i am in la now
whatta you doing out there
i am going into the movie business
what are you talking about you wanna be a movie star
i am thinking about producing
how you gonna do that you do not know shit about making movies
i do not think the producer has to do much outside of maybe knowing a writer
hey chil i think you are fulla shit
whatta you mean whose point of view the audience's point of view
get down here i wanna talk to you come on right now  she is gonna talk to martin
what 'emotiong girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick

no problem you go on off to bed
oh yeah sure
he happens to be loaning me five hundred grand no strings i write any kind of agreement i want
hello martin

roger that north island arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two over and out
i will sleep good tonight knowing that
with that coxswain dickhead
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away
i do not care what ai not nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size
nah everything was cool it is just one of those things
sixty pounds
what you sure
that is what it says
lemme see
damn mind of it is own
morning skipper
it is a beautiful country very clean very civilized and cold
we will see who's dreaming m'man
you find anything that even looks like a compressor i do not care what grab it
i do not know tuesday
wrong it is friday
maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat
lemme see was that before or after the oil fire
after fifty years there ai not nothing left but shoe leather
amidships starboard at the beam just under the waterline i do not think it is a problem
why not
then we will all be doomed any other questions
ever heard of insurance big boy
or uninvited guests
thanks for the warning  ow damn
i tell you one thing we are not gonna be towing no ship now
what are you crazy
i like my job
i am telling you i saw somebody i do not know who it was but i saw somebody
gimme a break
so we kill him
i am saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest
maybe he is not alone
seen a lota movies
a what
then what the hell happened to him
right wednesday
hell no you think i am crazy
why not
yeah yeah
are you kidding me jealous epps gimme a break
it is a risk i am willing to take
sounds reasonable
what is it
threw a turbine blade
how long to fix
hard to say i gotta get in there and have a look at least a couple days depending
turbine rotor's shot
i thought you said it was just a blade
metal's crystallized gotta replace the whole deal
how much longer's that gonna take
like i always say 
i know i know two ways to do anything 
the right way and the wrong way
but how long
hard to say
we gotta get outa here dodge a storm blows up and we are history
i am telling you you do not want to be running that fan like it is
what about running number two by itself
it is a full 2500 horses down we could not drag that boat down hill on ice with it
how long then
i gotta pull the blades and reseat everything in a new rotor  
how long
three four days
goddamit dodge
she take a radio
what you think there's something funny about it
then it happened before they scuttled her
either way they must have had a pretty good reason
a salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself it is ours
then we are rich we are damn filthy stinking rich
it looks like it
so we get a little more for the boat besides the gold will be safer where it is
the sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending that is ours
how about you epps
yeah yeah
warm water current maybe making the metal expand
bullshit that boat has not made steam for fifty years we found her she is ours
not in the eyes of the law
why not why the fuck not
we will stand a watch four on eight off low man first
fresh ai not the first word that comes to mind
could be meant as a warning
so whoever did this might still be around
i might be able to find something on the ship but it is gonna take time
do what you need to do just do it fast
what is it
i think you better see this for yourself
if they knew what they were carrying
for starters getting that gold off the ship what they do not know about is not gonna bother them
i do not know what you are talking about
i think you know
maybe you can tell me then
the radio oh yeah the radio
you smashed it
what the fuck  
you did not want us calling anybody too liable to ruin your big payday
i did not touch the fucking radio
conveniently enough for you
look i did not touch it alright
turbine chamber on number two must have blown took out part of the hull
if money can buy what he wants
i do not figure there's much i want money cannot buy
then you are a lucky man
maybe twenty gallons an hour
show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you epps
showed him a hell of a lot more than that
i bet you did
too big more like a freighter
he would let you off at the nearest port that is for sure
cargo like this could make a crew think twice
probably did not have time
that is what i call a payday
hell yeah
hell yeah i like it cold colder the better
because of the gold
i feel fine
better than starving to death
yeah fine i just thought i heard something is all
they must have scuttled it nobody just lets a ship float away
her destination was halifax yeah
nobody knows there have been a lot of theories of course but we will never really know for sure
you think she is sailing without a crew
only way to be
maybe but there's always somebody whose interest's at stake
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this
did you see him
what guy
there's somebody else on this boat
what what the hell are you talking about
i saw him just a minute ago some guy
are you sure
of course i am sure i saw him
you sure it was not me
it was not you it was somebody else there's somebody else aboard
we do not exactly have the best bargaining position
no cowboy shit right
yeah just a bird just a stupid bird
i will call us in dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up  keep an eye on him
same any luck
no i will try again later
if they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats
only something must have gone wrong
but who  
february first
the same day she supposedly went down
must not have been the captaings entry he was probably out of the picture by then
collision with what
the page's missing then their sos was real
but where is the damage
maybe the other ship took the worst of it
if it was a ship she hit
let 'em ask this ship's legally ours now
does not matter
wish i could say the same
i guess that is the sixty four thousand dollar question is not it
the what
i do not know are we
not our mystery guest again
no someone else a girl  i am not sure she was real
i do not know what else you would call her one second she was there the next she was gone
showing you what
what happened
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks
no i think they are were just passengers innocent victims
victims of what
something bad happened here murphy
that much i think we have already established
more than just a mutiny more than just the gold
i do not know
just lucky i guess
epps over
either of you seen dodge
right here
leave him till we can get some help  from now on nobody comes down here
could be a stroke who knows  the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves like wild dogs
over the gold
maybe it was more than that
crazy with greed not crazy not like him
if the weather holds it might not be so bad
we hit land
greer's gone he broke out of the tank
i did not want it to turn out this way
murphy do not you see that is happening
i think i see it pretty well
it is the ship the ship's making you think this way
i know a little bit about human nature and what i have seen only confirms that
i wish i could believe that either way you know what i have done i have got no choice
let the buyer beware
what do you say dodge
he will sell the scrap for three times what he paid
i must be in the wrong business
you got that right
better than making hamburger for mickey d
red sky in morning sailor take warning
looks like it is adrift
steer to one eight five let's check her out
how is that
besides a little rust everything's pretty wellpreserved
you mean tow her back that is a thirty thousand ton ship you are talking about
we have done it before
guess i must have fallen back to sleep where is epps
hard to say maybe forty fifty million
ho baby
not for fifty million an ocean liner maybe but fifty million in gold they come looking for
we leave it where it is stick to the plan
it is worth the effort believe me besides we are gonna need her to prove the salvage
dodge you gotta get on those repairs
we could call for help
and get a bunch of fools sniffing around here
not much at all i guess retire live out my golden years and all that
let's just take it easy here alright nobody's gonna kill anybody
supposing he wants to get bad with us
could not have happened much more than a month ago
drink up then
lost my sea legs
you do not remember
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera down somewhere in there scavenging around
you have been out for about a day
say what
dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins
we heard you scream any idea what you might have seen
i wish i could tell you i would be real interested to know myself
alright everybody grab your gear this' is where we get off
shut up
must be a little too the truth eh dodge
a what
government weather it is got a transmitter aboard
the mooring has not come taught
must have heard something below deck and went down to check it out
so whoever did this now has our shotgun
does not look like it much matters
leave it
now hold up just a minute let's be reasonable here
you think whoever did this is reasonable
all i am saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was
why not you mind your own business chief
did not you hear me grandpa or you got your hearing aid turned down
i heard you but i am choosing to ignore you epps let's go
you got about two seconds to get your paws off me tarzan
or what
better late than never
that is this
you got a leak in the number nine compartment
no no you got leak
you pump it out and reseam the hull she will be good as new
that cost me twenty grand at least
fifteen at the most
twenty you knock off twenty and then we see after my guy looks at it
you want fair pay make hamburger for mickey d otherwise please to sign
malaria epidemic very sudden
let me see the sick
oh you are a doctor now too
there is no reason for fear
on that i choose to remain dubious  two are dead now in two nights 
he will replace you too that is all you really care about
as are they all
that is ridiculous talk and you cannot seriously believe it
now you are telling me my beliefs i do not think so
at last you are right we do you are the problem in tsavo
careful abdullah
you do not know all that has happened here the devil has come to tsavo
you are right the devil has come look at me i am the devil
am i to take it you want to live
most certainly absolutely yes
excellent decision  your name is abdullah i am sure we will meet again go and enjoy the splendid morning
i think it is been a pleasure
how we do not know where they are
i am sure you have examined my record so you know i have never yet been late on a bridge
you have never built in africa
but i have in india every country presents problems
you will need your confidence i promise you
how could it be i hate africa
do not they though
so work must be going well
yes he is
well i need to speak to him
that is the surprise in that this is africa
it has not been that simple so far
what have they done besides kill starling  how many have they killed 
in point of fact it did not  but i am convinced the theory is sound
not a time for modesty bob
then why do you stay
you do not enjoy killing do you 
then why do it
nigel and i do not like each other much
please you need not be so graphic
you intend sorting this out tonight
is it i am sorry but then of course you are the doctor you should know
silliest thing i ever heard of why in the world should we go through all that
then we agree 
we are not much good at goodbyes helena
tell me about beaumont does he understand how brilliant you are how lucky he is to have you
it was embarrassing the man showered me with compliments
well it is just  other men do not abandon their wives at such a time
i am desperate to see africa but i hate the leaving
we have hunted since childhood
i would never make excuses but a fire broke out the light was bad he kept moving
just that they fart through their mouths  must make kissing something of a gamble
does he speak english
i have got medical supplies to deliver come along to the hospital when you are done 
and anxious to get started  what is this mostly malaria
yes but their suffering is only transitory once they except god into their hearts he will vanquish all pain
might be exciting for you
i have never been all that adventurous i would not be in the way
i would love the company and i have hunted all my life
well why not you seem so calm and experienced  why not indeed 
you will have to deal with it nigel
that is precisely my plan but back in my tent 
not to terrify you nigel but it is worse than you think i have never even seen one
so that is what a lion looks like 
true enough but without the comedy relief 
are not we full of ourselves today  i think it is because of the lion
you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just  there
nigel you will just have to use your hands 
that is what the books say 
you mean nobody died
what did i do
got me out of trouble
nonsense samuel would have done something 
we need to talk
all right let's go into battle  i am redbeard 
somehow i guessed 
i am always considerate my mother taught me that
no but you do  see you were needed after all  and fifty warriors at the camp before dawn
samuel says you killed a lion
it was probably luck i would rather you did the shooting
has it ever done that before
do not know
have you ever failed
only in life 
but of course yours worked
in point of fact it did not but i am convinced the idea is sound
i got big 
nobody's seen anything like this lions do not have caves like this  they are doing it for pleasure
do not they have to be
i cannot control mine i would be lost without the shame factor driving me
was that supposed to make me feel better 
you think they will come then  why
good luck
the most of any lions a hundred  probably more  johnny
understood you realize now you could never have done it without me
actually i could have done it much more easily without you but for whatever reason i am glad you came 
because they are here  because tsavo is the worst place in the world  come john to the bridge 
thank you the truth is this you have to work at it constantly
the workers do not get on
this is more difficult
clearly you do not agree about building the railroad
you they cannot believe you are still here
look out samuel here it comes
thank you samuel
good news
i expect so it is from my wife
do you love her
i do actually very much
you give me hope john 
oh yes but it takes time
you have known him long
since his beard was red
he does not he needs nobody but we have hunted many times  he knows i am afraid of lions
i feel the same about the bridge this country certainly did not ask for it does not need it
underneath  somewhere
it is all right samuel we all get hit 
i do not believe you had a mother 
four should do it
they will want a lot of money
because i have two plans to kill the lions one involving the cattle the other the men
not even close  what happened
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas you
help finish the railroad
hold your son high 
i do not know  it probably would have been the same
well thanks a lot
nice going honey  it was brand new
i did not break your precious clock roy
to the bathroom where do you think
have i done the right thing
it is a star  that is great  you are very good
ummm  figure eight
incredible  five for five  you are not cheating on me here are you
no  they are just coming to me
well you are doing great  keep it up
do you think i have it dr venkman
definitely  i think you may be a very gifted telepath
i was just going to say eight  you are fantastic
hi louis
 i thought it was the drug store
are you sick louis
hi louis
hey it is crazy in here  you are missing a classic party
well actually louis i have a friend coming by
i got the twister game for later 
i am zuul
i am innocent  honest dana  i never touched you  not that i remember anyway
all right what happened to me
yes  well  i am not sure  what i have to say may sound a little  unusual
we are all professionals here miss 
barrett  dana barrett
so what do you think it was
some people like the attention  some people are just crazy
it is in the stars
really  do you have a favorite piece
i would have to say prokofiev's third concerto
that is a violin concerto
yeah but it is got a great cello break
no  what do i act like
like a used car salesman
thanks  that is in there
i will wait here if you do not mind
i told you i 
i know  it happened by itself
yeah yeah
this is terrible  either there's a monster in my kitchen or i am completely crazy
if it is any comfort to you i do not think you are crazy
thanks  coming from you that really means a lot to me
i think i should spend the night here
that is it  get out
on a purely scientific basis
i will scream
do not scream
then leave
okay okay  but if anything else happens you have to promise you will call me
all right
okay  then i will go
you heard it
you are the best one in your row
most people cannot hear me with the whole orchestra playing  you are good
i do not have to take abuse from you  i have other people dying to give it to me
i know  you are quite a celebrity these days  are you here because you have info  about my case
who's the stiff
the stiff  he happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man
is he dying or something
yes but i have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant
cannot you tell me now
well the name zuul refers to a demigod worshipped around 6000 bc by the  that is that say
hittites  the mesopotamians and the sumerians  zuul was the minion of gozer
gozer  he was very big in the sumerian religion  one of their gods
that is he doing in my refrigerator
i am checking on that  i think we should meet thursday night at nine to talk about it
i do not think so  i am busy thursday night
i am zuul  i am the gatekeeper
okay i will help you  should we make some dip or something
he is the destructor
well i will just use it for a while and get it right back to you
take me now
i want you inside me
right  you are the gatekeeper  but i want dana  dana speak to me 
there is no dana  i am zuul
whoa nice voice
really  is it gone
yeah along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions  this one took some work
thank you  next time i want to break a lease i will know who to call
talk to my accountant 
fine  this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities
but why  the students love us
he is a big one  you do not want to mess with that particular breed
definitely some sort of fighting spaniel i think
yeah it is some kind of mallowtype substance  that is for sure
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street
i wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area
that would definitely explain it
yes  i am dr venkman and this is dr stantz
thank you for coming  i would appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly
one thing at a time  we do not even know what it is yet
back off man  i am a scientist
we will get back to you
print is dead
oh that is very  unusual
i think it is the food of the future
remind me not to go to lunch with you
in the physical sense
what is it
it is a souvenir from the 1964 world's fair at flushing meadow  it is my lucky coin
i do not believe in luck
keep it anyway  i have another one at home
thank you
what calls
here are tonight's calls
the epa  that is he want
has this ever happened before
i am walter peck  i represent the environmental protection agency third district
great  how is it going
are you peter venkman
yes i am doctor venkman
i have phd's in psychology and parapsychology
i see  and now you catch ghosts
you could say that
and how many ghosts have you caught mr venkman
i am not at liberty to say
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them
in a storage facility
and would this storage facility be located on these premises
yes it would
and may i see this storage facility
no you may not
and why not mr venkman
because you did not say the magic word
and what is the magic word mr venkman
the magic word is please
why do you want to see it
have it your way mr venkman
hey  make yourself useful  go save a tree
probably a mixture of gases no doubt stolen from the army 
that is peck
 or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really biblical proportions
a square
good guess  but no
well just 75 more to go  that is this one
two wavy lines
sorry  this is not your day
you volunteered did not you  are not we paying you for this
yeah but i did not know you were going to give me electric shocks  what are you trying to prove
i am studying the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability
i will tell you the effect  it pisses me off
then my theory was correct
they are not guns  they are particle throwers
yeah yeah  i just want to see 'em
i could not do that  you might hurt someone
what on earth gave you that idea
the wet towels residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair the redness in your cheeks indicating 
you are a regular sherlock holmes  now what do you want
when you were in the bathroom did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly
what have you got egon
oh this is big peter  this is very big there's definitely something here
i am always serious
she is telling the truth  or at least she thinks she is
yeah i can smell it
why not
trust me  it will be bad
what do you mean bad
what is it
i am with dana barrett and she is floating three feet off the bed
does she want to be
i will spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning
all right peter  good night
if you turn that thing off we will not be responsible for the consequences
oh shit
let me guess  gozer worshippers
get a grip on yourself egon  i talked to dana barrett and she referred to gozer as the destructor
fullstream with strogon pulse
no  them  shoot them  cross the beams
life is just a state of mind
but it is my favorite state
i blame myself
we would better adjust our streams
god it is ugly
easy  easy  i am going to throw in my trap now
neutronize  system shut
i need two new purge valves  how is the grid around the storage facility holding up
the storage facility blew  this one    shut off the protection grid
looked at with your eyes
well i was at an unexplained multiple highaltitude rockfall once
uhhuh  i have heard about the rockfall ray i think you have been spending too much time with spengler
it looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly
what do we do now
i do not know  talk to it
what do i say
anything  just make contact
hey lady  lady  can you talk  who are you   this is not working  think of something else
okay  okay  i got it  i know what to do stay close  i have a plan
ray i apologize  i guess my confidence in the regents was misplaced  they did this to galileo too
to go into business for ourselves
my parents left me that house i was born there
you are not going to lose the house everybody has three mortgages these days
but at nineteen percent interest  you did not even bargain with the guy
maybe  but no one ever advertised before
do you think it is wide enough  how much
fourteen hundred
good idea  were any other words spoken that you remember
it was not a date  it was an investigation
do you know when that might be  we are on the brink of a very serious cashflow problem
no sense worrying about it now
sure  each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back  no problem
where are you pete
third floor  get down here
sit tight  i am on my way
well hurry up  the needle's going wild
do not move  it will not hurt you
how do you know
i do not know  i am just guessing
i cannot take much more of this  the pace is killing me
it is not good pete
he is listed on the blueprints as i shandor
i do not think it is shandor
forget the trapping  just blast him
what  what popped in there
uh  oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barrett's apartment building  and they are most unusual
are you a christian ray
boy  solid cores of shielded selenium 325
do you believe in god
no  but i liked jesus' style
me too parts of the bible are great
the whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesiumtungsten alloy
ray do you remember something in the bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves
and the seas would boil 
right  and the sky would fall 
judgement day 
yeah judgement day
every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world
right  we will believe anything
later man
what do you mean choose  we do not understand
we are nearly there lucilla
that is what you told me two days ago
will you please get back in your wagon  and stay there
i am tired of being stuck in that wagon
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed
and caesar  let's not forget to serve caesar
why  then they will notice when i am gone  well  i am making a public appearance are not i
maybe you should get married  pick one of your cousins it would demonstrate a profound stability
i am sure i do not know
commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father  except that he cannot heave out his ghost
if i may be so bold
for the gods spit it out
why not do it in the colosseum
you cannot do that  you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you
you are coming back
taking my pleasure  do i need to clear my lovers with you
you must start clearing everything with me  especially your lovers
why are you so surly  you have won brother  the people have bread and the city is quiet
what is that wailing
the fans of narcissus  they were on vigil outside the school of proximo they believe he is dying
now that we are done with that infatuation forever
if i ever loved narcissus it was not like you want
but i get what i want always do not i
you cannot do that listen to the mood of the crowd
i want that bastard dead
you want control of the crowd  you cannot get it by killing their hero
i am their hero
not yet dear brother
send them out
do you want posters too
you would have had a full scale revolt on your hands
of course but not now  however if he continues to be unwell you may report to me
that is difficult to say general
perhaps master galen you may say
gladly caesar
or perhaps into a new one  but here's to your god and the courage of our legions
oh but with the army behind you you could become extremely political  not a republican by any chance
the dangerous man caesar is the man who does not care
you flatter me caesar
being as close i am certain you have noticed what we all have noticed
we have to stop the germans now
apparently my opinion was not needed
cooperate and they will be returned to your estate  i could have executed you
and my army would have thrown your body into the danube
ignore that  the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better
at least stay for the running of the animals  you are paying for it you know
until your confirmation date
at the opening of the month of janus i will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship
maybe it will crush gaius
i am serious
so am i
make a gift to the people  it is your money anyway so it is only fair
i would not know who to bet on
he left us at dawn
i met with falco and the senators have agreed to call for a truce with the germans
narcissus will never support you caesar he has too much of a philosophical temperament
where is the emperor and the army soldier
he must have been  he was on the list of prisoners to be executed
caesar i did my best  the colosseum is not under my control
jerses  tomorrow
yes caesar
we need more statues  perhaps i should open medical clinics  for the poor  citizens only though
i do not know
agh  please  he is having a secret device constructed for the circus the brass craftsmen are working overtime
i will nose around
the exact month when the emperor must be confirmed
but have never been
we all know what right is senator
you are hearing about somebody else
how did you get condemned to the arena without a trial
when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial  you would have to give me your word
i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing
you are a citizen and a soldier  not a gladiator
you do not know how wrong you are
why you
my loyalties were in doubt
fools to let us both live we will be our own best witnesses at our trial
that is what worries me
they cannot if this is rome
narcissus  terrified  you  the only thing he is scared of is me
only from a distance
sneaking around with your brother
why do you keep playing at being so humble  it is a little embarrassing
why do you play at being drunk
yours will do
you mean a symbol of someone who does not exist
but you do exist  narcissus  hero of the battle of the danube
would that marcus had lived
marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son
he killed his father and then my family
narcissus i have your family they are alive  all of them
the fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they are most vulnerable
i will marcus  but you are going to be well enough to direct it yourself
he is like you sir too tough for the gods to swallow
the senators admire you
they fear me
much more colorful than the ones we wear  and of course less dented
on your honor as a roman officer daddy
on my honor as your daddy
let's hope he does not start giving orders
well we can try
what deal
rome is going to pay an allotment to the german tribes on an annual basis
my troops do not make policy
well they die for it
i was summoned
it is your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons
is not the helmet magnificent
they are studying with cynics
of course
i can see that
the battle is over  the war is over  you have won
we do not need your help we are doing great on our own
quintus is overly idealistic
i never knew a more idealistic man than you
what you do not want to imagine is the things i have done
that is what i am going to do  that is what i am going to do
i killed too many barbarians
general all i know is you have been condemned to the colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen
impossible  every citizen has a right to trial  this is rome
chain him
 to fight  we will see
then you will die  just know this  because you asked i asked  i am sorry but
i did not get killed and everyone else did
that is one way to look at it
think about it  just think about it
do not be ridiculous
what the hell are you talking about greek
you get to come alive again in the country
as what 'the galloping gladiator'
the point is you get to fight the easy country circuit the small arenas relax live the good life
such nobility from such an ignoble mouth  take my advice and make that bet
a great deal  they designed and build tiger's chariot
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right they do not waste time
i can really rape them on this  can i at least tell them you will think about it
no  tell them i will do it  but i want more posters all over rome
fantastic  wonderful  but posters are very expensive
then get a large cash advance
right right but they will have to bring in a lawyer  i do not want to get sued over this
before they leave get gold
right right what am i thinking of
i want another interview with cos tell him to bring plenty of ink
was i
something else then  do the chariot races interest you
i would love some
if it is all right with you i am not hungry
no  why should i
i do not know
i am sorry i took you in there
i think i would better go home now please
but elaine 
where is the car
i just want to tell you something
but could i just tell you this one thing
oh  that is very nice of you to tell me
no i could not
but could you try
no i mean  i would not want to wake anyone up
we will not let's go inside
wait a minute
is anything wrong
no  i was just thinking  look  it is still early  we could do something  go somewhere else
all right
i am trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here

what do you think
i think it is
all right then yes

elaine  i love you
how could you do that benjamin
did you say rape her
 how you  how anyone  could do a thing like that
what did she say
let me go
you have got to tell me what she said
i do not feel well
then you took her upstairs and you raped her
elaine  that is not what happened
 and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off  and 
benjamin  this is my mother

i got up i ate breakfast and went shopping during the afternoon i read a novel
what one
i do not remember
there's no risk
i walk out
you walk right out the door
he is asleep
please now tell me how do you know he will not wake up sometime and follow you

how many times a year
on new year's eve sometimes on his birthday
man is this interesting

think real hard benjamin
i cannot see why you did unless you did not have to marry him or anything did you
do not tell elaine
oh no you had to marry him because you got pregnant
are you shocked
well i never thought of you and mr robinson as the kind of people who
all right now let's get to bed

not particularly
was he a law student at the time
why are you asking me all this
because i am interested mrs robinson now what was your major subject at college

how do you think
i mean did he take you up to his room with him did you go to a hotel
benjamin what does it possibly matter
i am curious
we would go to his car

happy to see you looking so good
it is for your cigarette  i prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants
they said on the phone you were assigned to the meyers case
with all due respect detective you cannot go blaming every brutal murder in illinois on michael meyers
right  so why do not we get on with this investigation
i like a woman who takes control
that do not match either of the victim's
no blood on the knife
broken blood vessels on her right forearm
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains
girl scouts

it is amy kramer
my god
pretty messy  parents have already been notified  our office has been trying to get a hold of you
does not look good
what the fuck are you talking about
michael meyers never used a meat cleaver  it was a butcher knife
who are you the serial killer police  what difference does it make
it is not historically accurate that is all

i think someone broke into my house

my point exactly  see we both agree
my life is a living hell

i thought you would never ask
i know
i just went for a walk  it is no big deal
wrong  there are rules in this house and you are going to follow them whether you like it or not

yes sir
well you will soon have stories like that to tell of your own
you think so sir
sure be able to tell your children something for them to look up to be proud of
i hope so sir golly i never knew it could be so exciting
it is the greatest excitement in the world
to pit your own life against another
that is right
to kill the taste of blood in your mouth
the moment of truth
another mangs life in your sights
oh sure a variety of weapons
and to use the bayonet pachoie
oh sure
how about handtohand combat
well i do not
i would like that you could see the blood squirt out
harold i think you are getting carried away here
sir how about souvenirs
harold that is udisgustingu
she is a commie pig we are going to nail every last one
she took my head
yes ma'am somebody had some trouble parking
well it is a tricky turn
eh yes ma'm
tell me    is that car parked all right
oh yes that is fine
well thank you eh officer you might turn off the radio saves the battery
was that the one with the st christopher medal on the dashboard
oh yes how did you like that

oh do not be too discouraged for aesthetic appreciation  always a little time
but wait
look do you want the bed in or not
just take it slowly
oh sod you
my fucking hand
who are you calling a fucking ass hole it is this bastard bed that is your fucking problem
not much
we are leaving
where is my father
it will go in
do you really need this bed lady
her mother's dead
lucky man
damn right now are we going to move the bed or not
it is just a puzzle box
it is a means to summon us  it is called the lament configuration
who are you
cenobites explorers in the further regions of experience demons to some angels to others
well i did not mean to open that thing you can go back wherever you came from
you solved the box we came now you must come with us taste our pleasures
no tears please it is a waste of good suffering
you did this before right
many times
to a man called frank cotton
he did i have seen him
i could lead you right to him you could take him back to hell instead of me
no that was not the deal
stay the fuck away from me
you can keep them
i have to speak to my father
that is easily arranged but first back into bed
it is important
you took quite a beating you must lie down
first things first you can have a telephone when we have talked do you know who did this to you
i do not remember
well the police are going to want to speak to you you know that
oh christ
we will get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put
what what will you do what can you do  there's nothing to be frightened of
this is not happening
you want it
this is not happening
some things have to be endured
do not mourn him he was dead long before we laid a finger on him
poor baby
that is right who are you
i am brother frank
oh  oh yes
well can i come in or not
i am sorry of course you are very welcome
but you said 
i do not want to see the dress

believe me it is me it is really me
what happened to you
his blood on the floor it brought me back

what do you want me to do
the blood brought me this far i need more of the same or i will slip back
keep your voice down
you are hurting
not know
tell me damn you
you promised me an explanation
a box
it is not any box it is called the lament configuration it is a puzzle
let me see
do not touch it it is dangerous it opens doors
what kind of doors
sure somewhere safe  safe christ they tortured me here in this room
who did
you would be they tore me apart
so you were cheated
no they gave me experiences beyond the limits pain and pleasure indivisible
i do not
so where is the harm
i said no
then find me somebody else before they come looking
i do not think so she will want larry first
that is probably her now or the police
there's very little i can do about it
maybe we should just leave 
like this look at me like this
well we cannot just stay here 
i need a skin then we leave 
there's a towel in the bathroom

okay okay
you owe me  besides i am cute
church hill that is pretty close is not it
anything in maryland is close
i would like to ask you about the claymore
it is not mine
it is quite rare you know some thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years
charming guy basil  once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but
good day miss cartwright
have you taken to touring small town cemetaries miss cartwright
grave robbers
does carl smith
i have been to church hill
i doubt that  good day miss cartwright
you will be safe here  he will not kill in a church
why not
at the moment  carl smith
and you
you need not worry miss cartwright i have been at this a very long time
he called you macleod
not your concern
i left a man dead in felton  but you do not really care do you
that bothers you
he was innocent
he is dead  whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now
what about me
have you gone to the police
i would rather hear yours
you are being foolish
i am a historian mr taupin only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face
go home
are you
no  i had to talk to you
you had to do _nothing_
you are wrong
you are a fool
you have been listening to rumors
our cars were seen together in felton  they are calling me an accessory to murder
you are  now
richard taupin has become cumbersome  it would be best if he just disappeared
not all of them
when you finish what then
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr taupin
you make it all sound so simple
it will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to gettysburg
they do it each year
i thought it might be a nice break from all of this
there's a catch  you are supposed to wear 19th century clothing
it is beautiful
a little dusty
follow me
at least
that is impossible
a factor of age
i hope i never get that old
you will not
i am not even sure why
hardly a reason to run off with a murderer
just a little crazy
that would be difficult to explain
i would like you to try
he is older than i
what could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction
perhaps  there is something more an inheritance
of bodies
i did not kill the watchman
you killed those other two
not the same
what about that family in '31
sometimes innocents become involved
you kill with your left hand
i have not killed _you_
is that a threat
come here brenna
damn you
it is all the same  half lives that never go away
what is it you want
all of it finished
will i see you again
be careful  do not stay any longer than you have to
i cannot stand it  oh god i cannot stand it
i am the last  oh christ i am the _last one_
not power  not control
you have lived forever
i am just curious
you are never just curious  you have met my neice brenna
now there's a new topic
do not they have enough for you to do at the castle
what do you want from me
you and i should talk first
we have got nothing to say
spare me the details
i want taupin
what makes you so sure he is the one
what were you doing in felton
research  if your pal was there i never saw him
i have witnesses that can put the two of you together
never take up poker detective
do not be stupid lady  your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's
all i need is for you to check the name
it is that important
it is bullshit  everything my job the people i get involved with i am up to here with it
you always were hard to impress
not who  what  worstick's a town in pennsylvania
you see that desk  _your_ desk  you see the crap piled up on it
give it a rest ned huh
what are you doing man
et lux perpetua
you will not be bringing the church into this
luceat ei
auditorium nostrum
you are not from these parts
i am from spain  and i would like a moment of your time
please go to no trouble
five years past me clan fought another over some thing i cannot even re member
your marks would suggest great injury
i was nearly killed
but you lived
and but for a mark you are well as any man no
and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew
how can you know this
first food no  a good meal makes conversation so much easier
why are you here
i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con sultant on matters of metal
you are a long way from inverness
it was time for our paths to cross
do you ever feel a flow as if some thing were pushing against you
yes  always
does it change with me in the room
it is less
you feel you know me
i do not know why
we are brothers
you are still so very young
i am twentytwo
not even a single lifetime
this is madness
it is the truth
this cannot be
you are not dead boy  accept it
this is monstrous  i will burn in hell for all eternity
you would have to die first  aqui
you will live  survive
then they were right  i am evil this is god's punishment
you have done nothing wrong conor macleod
oh my god  oh my god i am lost
you recall how i spoke of the push you feel and how i make it less
me arm hurts
again  try again
go to hell
oh the boy has a mouth now if only he had an arm
muy bien
it is like to kill me first
and what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt
the fabric of life  the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another
if that was meant to be an ex planation mr romirez from spain i am afraid you have failed
point conceeded mr macleod
all living things pay dues conor  they must be respected for that
you are young inexperienced  you do not know what time can do  how it can sap all pity all love
that is not me
with the proper tools conor a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one
i will be back when i can
i have no future husband
i do not understand  not a week ago your father gave us his blessing
what are you saying  i am standing here as real as you
you cannot be real conor  you had the last rites  no man has been cut half as bad and lived
but i did live
live  in less than a week you are prancing about the country like a squirrel
so why the crazy talk  it is a miracle it is  saint andrew has smiled on me  on us
some think not
that is mad  surely you do not take their word
i do not know conor  it is not natural  maybe something has touched you
you are sounding like that mad woman widow baggins
me father has taken back my hand
i will not take that kind of talk from you  from those others below maybe  but not from you
leave me alone conor  please
you are not talking sense mara
do what you must
what would you like
something pretty
like you
far away
kiss me
certainly not me
perhaps not  you seem to have misplaced a private  no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck
no doubt
romirez is dust
finish yours
they are nothing but boys  it will be a slaughter tomorrow
i doubt much can change that the enemy has five brigades waiting for us
we need more time
will not get it  we are a sacrifice  a diversion
not likely
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break fast cooking

your murder weapon

a mystery
for the moment

we have certainly been in some swell jams
remember the time we broke into the da's office and copied fifi randell's diary
yeah what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory six scoop interviews
in the shoreland hotel and our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach

what would you do if it was a daughter
well if she looked like you  say my brains and your looks  that might not be such a bad combination

i am told unusual promises were made to wigand
no only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him
and i am told there are questions as to our star witness' veracity
his veracity was good enough for the state of mississippi
our standards have to be higher than anyone else's because we are the standard for everyone else
well with tortious interference i am afraid the greater the truth the greater the damage

that is room service they usually knock first  come on in over here please

always  like tits on a pig  i wish i had a million of those bimbettes
and oswald
three four  he came in with a few cubano swishes one time i remember
of course there were not 'cause they disappeared  and yet the commission found you dean

bullshit  bartender another round  here's to the new frontier  camelot in smithereens  i will drink to that
get home my ass  we are going to the office have another drink  i want some company tonight
i could not be more serious jack those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty
you may not like this chief but you are beginning to act paranoid  i mean you really are
no shaw  director of the trade mart  this is incredible
it is you i want to talk to bill
boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew 
your boss got a serious problem bill  real serious  we know that is been going on at your office
yeah i guess you do
senator long set your boss up my friend
i am just an investigator bill  i leave the theories to you lawyers
you numa
not unless we go for shaw now
keep saying what
you are not digging
who is he joe  i have been to every bar no one wants to talk
shaw  clay shaw
clay bertrand is clay shaw  the guy who used to run the international trade mart
yeah that is the big mystery everybody down here knows the guy
so why does he call himself bertrand
who gives a shit what he calls himself
twenty dollars each time  hell it is no secret  that is what i am here for
yeah strange guy  dave introduced him as
well the party got crazier and crazier one of those y'know beatnik type things
the anonymous kind chief
at 730 sunday morning  it is not exactly fresh blood we are sniffing here boss
old stains bill but just as telling
that is gonna be tough  nobody's talking
i think we should have him in for a little talk
where you going boss
i do not know bill i just do not know
i do not see any violence jim  heart attack maybe an aneurysm  looks like natural causes
he would die pretty quick either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain
can you ascertain if there's proloid in his system
i see and why are you experiencing this paranoia
well you see i have been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948 when i was in korea
ever called dean andrews
no i did not
and have you ever met david ferrie
no i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures i have been shown
did you ever use the alias clay bertrand
no i did not
thank you mr shaw
i am a dead man  from here on believe me i am a dead man
what are you talking about dave you were not mentioned in the story do not jump to conclusions
you think your investigationgs been all that secret  you know when you talk to people they talk to other people
what did they
you still questioning any cubans
dave you know that is where this road leads
it leads farther than that
yeah  come on dave come on our side  i guarantee you the boss will protect you  dave
give me protection
yeah  he would kill for you dave  he likes you  your mind
i got no place to sleep  i will meet you in 20 minutes
that cocksucking faggot  he is got me by the balls
what do you mean
do you remember me mr garrison  i met you on carondolet street right after your election  i congratulated you remember
but you are aware he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager
no if he did i do not remember him  there were lots of kids in and out y'know
i am sure you have seen this  perhaps you knew this man under another name
no i never saw him before in my life
what was so appealing about houston
i see  and where did you drive
we went straight to houston and then saturday night we drove to galveston and stayed over there
why galveston
no particular reason  just to go somewhere
and then sunday
i believe the boys got a couple
but the boys told us they did not get any
dave i find your story simply not believable
would you say this leon was actually lee harvey oswald
you think i was a getaway pilot for the assassination do not you
i do not know  were you  who you scared of dave
same one  i did not know no impersonator
shaw's an untouchable man  highest clearance  shaw oswald the cubans  all agency
what about ruby
yeah yeah  but leave me alone for awhile  i got to make some calls
i was told that the family wanted examination of the head
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death was it not
i had the cause of death
no because there were others  there were admirals
there were admirals
that is our case
if that is your case you did not have a case  i would not believe whatever habighorst said anyway
i cannot believe you are saying this in the courtroom
well i am saying it  bring in the jury
that is something jasper  what is it
a rhinoceros  can i stay up another hour
hi freckle face
well it looks like it jasper
because of kennedy  are the same people gonna kill us daddy
no jasper nobody's gonna kill us
well if they can kill the president they can certainly get me
that does not make sense mrs hill we have the man that killed the president
no you do not
i want the truth
the truth is that i heard between four and six shots  i am not going to lie for you
you heard echoes
no  i had guns all my life  i used to go turtle shooting
i realize you are under a great deal of stress  it is clouded your judgement
four to six
and marina  does she have a problem getting out
equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas  all rabid anti communists
bugging the district attorney's office of new orleans  it is outrageous
no i do not think i am susie  anyone else
i know
well in an investigation we are conducting your name has come up a number of times
i would not imagine where
we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you  are you acquainted with a david logan
no  never heard of him
a perry russo
no i do not believe i know anyone by that name
no  i am sure i have never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance
does the name clay bertrand mean anything to you
one meets so many attorneys in my business  no i do not believe i know dean andrews
naturally  are you claiming mr garrison that mr oswald also had dinner with me
mr shaw did you ever meet lee harvey oswald
you really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters do not you mr garrison
please answer the question
no people like you do not have to i guess  people like you walk between the raindrops
may i go  regardless of what you may think of me mr garrison i am a patriot first and foremost
that is what bothers me mr garrison you see they have been altered  my statements
i know but mr garrison the fbi is just not doing their job
goddammit  i been sleeping for three years
you know i do not like these tribal rituals freckle face  i am interviewing clay shaw this morning
i am sorry but it is important  clay shaw is important  i am sorry
my sympathies
liz i am really sorry  the meeting went much longer than expected
we waited for you hours jim you could have telephoned for god's sake  it is easter  you promised jim
i do not know what to say except i am sorry  i just do not have rabbits on my mind
it is going to get worse honey
it is not funny jim i am scared
do not be  nothing to be scared about honey i been through four years of war  this is nothing
leave us alone for god's sake  oh it is lou
your daughter's life was just threatened
just a crank making phone calls happens a dozen times a day at the office
our home jim  a kidnapper a murderer who knows
only cowards make crank calls sweetheart nothing is going to happen
i am leaving  i am taking the kids and i am leaving  i will not stand it anymore
is it such a chore  i do not understand you
i never doubted for a second that i was  will you come to the trial elizabeth
i do not think so jim
oh no  no  i cannot believe it  i cannot believe it  both of them both brothers oh my god
well yeah
fuck yeah  i told you so  and you can tell'em all i told you so
you realize the things you are saying willie are going to be attacked by a lot of different people
boss the president's been shot  in dallas  five minutes ago
no word yet  but they think it is in the head
let's get outta here lou  i saw too much stuff like this in the war
yeah guy banister  exfbi man  he died couple years ago
lou you were in the marines  who would be running that training
the office of naval intelligence
take a look across the street
a photographer from the dallas times herald got some great shots of them never published
hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes  these two look pretty young
there was rose cheramie  a whore two cubans threw her out of a car on the way to dallas
graveyard dead near big sandy texas in '65  two in the morning on some highway  a hit and run
that means we gotta subpoena time life on it
how many men
his boss was the one on the warren commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community
allen dulles
we need him back
i have been called everything under the sun jerry  call me whatever you like
well if i am why is the government concealing evidence
are they  why would they
sure they do  the camera can pick this up
no it cannot
well i just hope it was worth my while mr
i have already been warned by the agency mr whoever  if this is another type of threat i do not
it never did 
more than ten years
and he never hit you before
never touched me
i do not know if i should talk about this
well i would ask guy  we were friendly you know  heart attack was not it
if you buy what you read in the paper
you have other information
i did not say that  all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out
why did guy beat you jack
was he there often
and oswald
bertrand  clay bertrand
yeah  that is it  i do not know  maybe it was not  i gotta go
clay bertrand  he is in the warren report  he tried to get oswald a lawyer  was kennedy ever discussed jack
sure  'course they hated the sonofabitch but
the assassination jack
you are so naive mister
you just need some sleep lou  it will not look so bad when
she is the best damn witness we have
i just do not want to do it  what else
yes thank you mr garrison  your coffee's almost turkish down here but i could get used to it
splendid love to see them
if you must know virtually nothing
how many men are working with you on this
less than you would guess  most days two to three assistant da's a handful of police investigators

you think i wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass

in his inside coat pocket
i went to give him his refund so he would not have to come here
how would you know where he was
i found out
and you did not tell the police
i told jackie and jackie said you wanted him
that looks like fifty thousand dollars from here
hey jackie
she wants to make a deal
she sound scared
she almost sounds scared
that is she want
she wants to go back to work
that is she willing to give us
she has not one into specifics yet she is been waiting for you
she knows it is my case
she ai not said it but she is not stupid she knows it is you who wants her
every step of this goes in my report  i am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag
what time do you have to be there
the usual things i am a flight attendant with cabo air
this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms would you mind if we looked in that bag
if i were to tell you no it is not
arrest me
while you are at it let me see what else is in there you mind
that is in it
beauty products
that is my diet shit
take your time
help you get ordell robbie
'course i do  i deliver money for him
can you do it or not
that is her name
he would not say you gonna follow her
she leaves somebody will be on her
but you are not going to stop her
who do you think i am
can i see your id
you are serious
in cash
sure ever been to the riverbottom
i do not think so
it is okay it is a cop hangout
could not we just stop at a seven eleven
i thought you might want a drink
i would love one but not there
we could stop at the hilton by the airport
is it dark
it is kind of a sports bar
that does not sound dark
why does it need to be dark
ten pounds i lose it and put it back on
i am as a matter of fact
that is him how do you know 'em
i wrote him on monday they found him dead on tuesday
ordell pick up his bond
same as you ten thousand
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont
you mentioned a guy from lapd but you did not mention the federal
i did not
no you did not what branch
ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms
it was the other guy who busted me
with ten thousand nine
he is got that kinda money
yeah if i cooperate
well jackie you got caught you are gonna have to give 'em something
i think maybe i have more options than i thought
i am have a seat
i felt a lot safer having it my milk went bad when i was in jail
black's fine
you went out this morning and bought a gun
you went out this morning and bought a gun
it looks nice
the delfonics
it is nice
are you
i want to talk to them first i know more now about ordell's money
well if the atf guy is the one who wants you that will only interest him up to a point
he told me last night
he called you
he came by
what what would you do
we talked
no thanks there's gotta be other ways to get it out
same way i been doing but first they got to let me go back to work
you are gonna offer to set him up
if i get let off otherwise fuck 'em
it is very possible ordell's killed somebody
i ai not going to jail and i ai not doing that probation thing again
you are not old you look great
i am asking how you feel does it bother you
it is not really something i think about
you know i cannot really feel too sorry for you in that department
i just feel like i am always starting over you said how many bonds you wrote
fifteen thousand
i know ignoring me what are you up to
catching a movie
what would ya see
american president
how was it
pretty good me and annette bening are goin steady
oh are you does she know that
for now these relationships never last too long
sandra bullock you know her
yeah she is the girl who drove the bus in speed she is cute
she is adorable but i had to end it
how old's annette
i do not care
i go back to work tomorrow
you talk them into it
they seem to like the idea
bring the money in and they follow it
right around here in the food court
sit down leave the bag under the table
i am helping him bring his money into america he loves the idea you just missed him
he was here
yeah we were going over everything that is why all the bags
i called you last night
maybe but i am thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself
i see
you do not propose something like that unless you are pretty sure the other persongs into it
has he hinted around
he were not bullshitting either 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire
has nicolet told you any colorful stories like that
what if i was in nicolet's place
no i mean you right now not it you were somebody else
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money would i take it
you are avoiding the question
okay sure i might be tempted especially now since i am getting out of the bail bonds business
when did you decide
it is been a long time coming i finally made up my mind  i guess it was thursday
the day you got me out of jail
and went to this guy's house in el monte and i waited for him
what do you do when he comes home
shoot him with the stun gun while he is incapacitated cuff him take 'em to county
you do that
that is my job
did you do it that night
more or less
which one
if you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a halfmillion dollars would you take it
i believe i said i would be tempted
what if i have figured a way
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now it is only money
do you think they bought it
oh yeah i got them thinking ordell's real nervous they love thinking he is scared of them
you know a good cop will not let you know he knows you are fulla shit
all he needed was a reasonable explanation
do not be so literal ray believed it
but you still have to show him the money at the airport
well you know i am not going to show him the whole amount he will see fifty thousand
where is the rest of it
in the bag underneath
what if he checks it
yeah but i am not in jail and i tried
you are gonna have surveillance all over you
that is why you do not make a move till i come out of the fitting room
in a dress
well a suit there's one i had my eye on
all winston had to do was ask around ordell's living in long beach with a woman junkie
how does winston find him if atf and all the local police cannot
get ordell to come to your office
set him up
tell him i want to give him his money
what do you tell nicolet
ordell called and wants to meet me and i am scared
what if he hears something he is not supposed to
well we do not let that happen now do we
less ten percent
yeah your fee i had to figure that out since there was not no note
i hesitated taking that much
you worked for it  if you are sure that is all you want
i am sure
that is he doing
i told him i might
i did not say you did
i never lied to you
i know
we are partners
i am fiftyfiveyears old i cannot blame anybody for anything i do
do you blame yourself for helping me
you will get over that
start off in madrid ever been there
thanks but you have a good time
sure i cannot twist your arm
thank you for saying that but no my business
i thought you were tired of your business
i am just tired in general
are you scared of me
i beg your pardon
what if i plead guilty
and cooperate you might get probation
if i do not cooperate
do you live together
not every day
then you do not see him for a few days
he say is a surprise
well sheronda it was nice talking to you
what the fuck is that shit
i know what it looks like
you planted that shit on me
it is not enough for trafficking but how about posession with the intent to distribute
can i smoke
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job
we can look into that
i need it tomorrow if i do not show up for work tomorrow i am fired
you know what we want
if i am working i can help you
you never asked me if i did or not
he sells guns
you ever see him sell guns
he told me besides why else would an atf man be after him
how can you help us
i thought you were going to let this one through
a broadway shopping bag
you two meet
not really
his full name is louis gara he just got out from serving four years in susanville
what for
bank robbery do you know what he does for ordell
i imagine shit needs to be done
we have been following mr gara and he is definitely working for ordell
ever meet her or they talk about her
not yet
who's the other one
white girl named melanie ralston another girlfriend of ordell's
that is her story
i am sure that was the idea
what did you say
i smiled and walked away she also told me ordell killed beaumont
she told you that
she did not say
but she mentioned beaumont by name
right everything's the same except one change
oh that is taken care of i called the state attorney's office you were nofiled this morning in circuit court
i was told ten thousand in each pack
you did not count it
i never have it is not my money
what to put one of these in my pocket
after all it do not belong to nobody right
that would be one point of view
you did not i would think with all this on your mind you would wait till after
i had to i was frantic i did not know what to do
what did you do after that
not in the fitting room
i have no idea
you would take a polygraph on it
if it will make you happy
i sure hope you have not done anything dumb jackie
i thought you were watching him
what about you
do you think i took some of that money
buy ya a beer

right you know it is not like you know there's a difference between sex making love and fucking
you know what it is like it is like when you really love someone it is like awww
it is really slow it is slow boring
yeah it is the biggest disappointment
yeah fifteen minutes to a half an hour hard and deep
me i can only take it up to fifteen minutes cause i get bored
yeah i get bored
i start thinking about what i am gonna eat afterwards
did they ask you a lot of questions
you think so
yeah i have always hated that kid he used to eat glue in like seventh grade
he still does
i hate 'em
it is not his fault he had a hard life
oh god that is horrible
no i was just kidding

all right
nothing we just wanted to come by and see what you were up to
you want a wipit
i do not know eight or nine
where does everyone sleep
yeah i had sex with jake and it took him like an hour and a half
it is like sweet and sour and salty butter
no no no you cannot get that taste out of your mouth until you eat something
yo let me get in your parent's room man just fir a little while
i cannot man
chess tournaments can be boring sometimes  people have a lot of free time  they like to gossip
what kind of problem
i think you are lying  that is what kind of problem
what are you saying
it was not serious  that is your problem
you are  i do not like you
fine do not ask me out on a date
you like to play games do not you peter
he says on the photo he will call tomorrow at eleven  why not come back then and listen for yourself
oh we will be back  you can bet on it
he says it is a game  all games have a strategy
all you gotta do is look at the map
let's see how much he wants to play
maybe you should
you do not have an investigation without me  you got that
that is right  i guess only the killer would know that
how would you get in here
the door was open
no it was not
of course it was  otherwise i would be breaking and entering  that is a felony
what do you want
you ever do any hunting peter
no i need the original note
there's a photostat of the original on the wall
then that is he talking about
i was at the beach
i am positive
you are a lying bastard
fuck you  i am tired of your goddam accusations  if you want to arrest me go ahead  otherwise back off
get off me
sit down
i want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer
it will take hours  you cannot make me do this
run it down
he is got an answer for everything but he does not have an alibi
you think he is dirty
i do not know but i think you are right he is lying
what was your relationship with her
i am sorry this is just too convenient
could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal
check with the state  if he is never killed outside of washington the fbi would not have it  nolan
maybe he is going to drug her
she is unconscious but they think she is going to make it
you alright
i have seen a lot of things in my time on the job but nothing like this yurilivich
i was with him the whole time until i got the call at the hotel
it is a voice modulator
he is one of the best chess players in the world  who better to play a game with
i do not know  maybe there's two of them  maybe he hired some wino to make the calls
did anyone stand out
what do you mean stand out
did anyone look suspicious  think
now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious
what was suspicious about him
but a hundred men could move him
he was with me
you could not find your dick in a wind storm
who is this
someone who's going to become an important part of your life  i want to play a game with you
i have not got time for this
just a second  hello
to get your attention
did you know her
no only the path she chose to travel
we all have paths to follow  you hope yours will lead you to me
why did you write remember on the wall
you do not want to think and that is why i will win  i am already two points ahead
where is she
you will find her
if you got something to say to me just come out and say it
you are not going to tell me that
not really
why her
because she is the type
but you said you did not know her
i know what i said  she looks just like
just like who
i really wish you would stop trying to maneuver me  i find it irritating not to mention insulting
i am just trying to play the game
you are not playing very well  there are clues all around you and you keep missing them
then call them
why are you doing this  you must have some idea of the pain you are causing people
pain  pain is just a state of mind it is something you learn to live with i have
please i do not want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions it would detract from the game
so is mine within the framework of my rules
if it is so important why do not you just tell me
i could not tell you that  it would ruin the game  not that you are playing it very well
you like to brag do not you
what makes you think i was there
i could not tell you that  it would ruin the game
the game's almost over peter and you are running out of time
you are playing the tarakoss opening
very good
you are next move should have been e2 e3
i used a variation  you should have anticipated that  have you figured out the message
what word did you leave last night
the police have not told you
they think that you and i are doing this together
you sonofabitch
emotional  i expected more from you
if you kill tonight and i am in jail the police will know i am innocent
by that time the game will be over
i have figured out the message
let me speak to my daughter
the game's over  you lost
it is me you want  not her
you are groping  i have been fair it is my move now
i will give you anything you want anything  please
do not beg peter  she has to die  i cannot win unless she dies
very good  how did you know
the pipes
you told me  when you called you said she was in the other room  drop the knife
you do not understand
yes i do  i found your file  i know what happened
oh i put a few games on for your daughter  i hope you do not mind
of course not
can we correlate data  look for specific things like player's ages stuff like that
no problem  we are in
set up some pieces on the big board
have computer search for anyone that is used that opening against me  there cannot be more than a handful
never mind  he died two years ago
1985  hans korshaud
he is in his seventies and lives in holland
new york  1986  viktor yurilivich
the scars on your chest  from where i stabbed you with my fountain pen
oh well we would not want to disturb your guests would we
you could have been honest with me for starters  we work together  i have to be able to trust you
i admit i handled it badly  sanderson was not going to talk to me but you are young attractive
the same type as the girl who got killed  jesus alan the guy could be a psychopath
they asked who would be best suited for this and you
do not patronize me  you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and did not warn me
fuck off
i just cannot believe it
you do not want to believe it  it is a normal reaction
i am just nervous  sorry
you are safe  he would not come here
he already did once
why did he what
come here
he was watching you
uh huh
i am kathy
he went down to the lobby for a minute he should be right back  would you like come in
not really  it is pretty boring
that is only because you do not know where to go  you like hiking  fishing  sailing  what do you like
of course
how do you know that  did he say something
no but i can tell  a woman knows these things
nice meeting you
my cheering section
i cannot sleep  my beds lumpy
i see  you forgot to bring you are nightlight did not you
that has nothing to do with it
you want to sleep in my bed tonight
no but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from ohio
thanks david
for what
you told me you would take me over to seattle today
i am sorry honey i cannot  not today
but you promised
who's kathy
not much  there's no sign of a break in  i think she let him in
how long has she been dead
six eight hours tops
any sign of rape
not that i can see  we will know more once i get the lab reports back from seattle
no prints
you mean no prints but hers
no frank  no prints
not a drop  maybe the guy works for the red cross
wait i have saved the best for last andy hit the lights will you
i would say at least eighteen hours
that means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message
you did not pick up any vibes from the guy
i am a psychologist frank not a psychic  that is this all about anyway
what did dr fulton tell you
what do you think he did
we think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation
it is important
and this jeremy
edmonds  i know  you lost to karpov in '82 did not you
but we heard him
it could have been a tape  a prerecorded conversation between sanderson and himself
yes  why disguise your voice if no one knows it
call dispatch  double the patrols  i want that area blanketed
i know that  i have seen the photo's
this ai not no photo
peter's right captain  he is got to be forced into making a mistake
that is a big area to cover
yes  why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure
about a quarter to one
what are you saying  that i am seeing what i want to see  that i am protecting a murderer  what
what does that mean
you do not have a shred of evidence
no  he was wearing a mask but i saw the cut on his wrist  it was peter
i cannot arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist  do you have someone you can stay with tonight
i have got a room at the institute i use when i stay late
okay  why do not you go out there we will check in with you later
ten days ago
do you know how she found the apartment
through a rental agency
did not you tell me that debi rutlege had just moved into her place also
only in passing  to say hello to
here  i played gregory lutz
i do not know  i was afraid there would be hours of questions  i cannot afford to miss a game
we have already met  have not we doctor
that is alright  we will take it from here
wee willie winkie runs though the street  we think he might be making a reference to himself
maybe but i do not think so  i think it is just a tease
upstairs and downstairs in his night gown  he could be saying the house he is picked is two stories
is  did you tell him about the institute
it does not make sense
how can he be playing chess with you you are not making any moves against him
maybe i already have
but he had to dump the body there to make the move
a building is not as light as air that is large but as light as air and cannot be moved
he uses castlesplural   then says cannot move me  singular  not cannot move us
that is got to be it
are we going to go through this again
answer the question
i went out
maybe he just got tired of covering for you
i understand that this is just another one of your games
i signed the confession  what about the car
it is over peter  let's stop the games  i am not sending a car
he knows you are aware of that
then i will transpose
on a variation yes  but it must be a variation that is unique
i suppose you have something in mind
you do not win by playing it safe peter
our computer went on the fritz again david came up to fix it
is it serious
i want to be the best i can
just thought you might want to talk
about what
whatever's on your mind
who says something's on my mind
mate in five
exactly and you did this
yeah  just let me grab a shower
thank you  i am at 6397393
we will call you back
sara this is doctor sheppard  i called you earlier about a book
yes doctor sheppard  we called you back but you were not home  we have the book
what are they please
carefully  carefully carefully
it is alright
how come you do not stay with them
because i love them but they drive me crazy  you know how parents are
no  i do not
uh huh
are you one of the players
it seems like such a complicated game
chess is a reflection of life  life is violent  the strong win  the weak perish
i see  this is going to be a very polite conversation  what shall we discuss  the weather  movies
are you disappointed that i will not answer you
i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess
it is
do you always open quickly
are we talking about me or chess
well i hope you remember that tomorrow when you play krikorian
getting too hot in here for you
nothing  i just came in for a steam
no you did not
i offered my help this morning and sedman turned me down
but you are the key  the one he wants to play the game with
i cannot right now  i have got a game
she could be dead after the game
she could be dead now
i do not think i could
it was not intentional
does that is going on bother you at all or are you just wearing your game face
another kind of game
in a way
this is not a game
do you
let's change the subject
okay  so tell me about yourself  are you married
that is not fair
are you going to tell me you did not feel something in there
no  i am not involved  and i plan on keeping it that way
i know it was bad
how could you  unless you were there
you know andy thinks you are doing this
does not that scare you
no  but i am open to distractions
i am sure you are
you always want to talk about me  what about you
was not i just talking about me
no  you were talking about chess
alright  what about me
i dunno  where is erica mother
she died in a car accident
i am sorry
it is alright  it was a long time ago
it must have been very hard on erica
it was
and you
i am not playing a game now
yes you are  you are playing word games
what is this
i am just trying to get to know you peter
what  by attacking me
does anyone
then show me who you are
you have got to face the things you feel
i thought you were the woman who did not want to get involved
i said i did not plan on getting involved
call room service
if i have to  i am going to take a shower
the line was busy  i will try again
i thought you said the line was busy
i tried again and got through
that is wrong
exactly  it is the key
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine  violent
a fierce magazine brutal  an angry magazine a war magazine a mercenary magazine  fierce  mad
right  here  c4
i was thinking that maybe when this is all over we could
i want someone i can get close to i do not know if that is possible with you
you really have not seen my best side
that is still no excuse  you treat everything like a game
you do not understand
then help me to understand  i want to understand
it is not that easy
why not
because i know what it says
maybe you are afraid of what it says
it is got to be grammatically correct
frank told me
no he did not
he did not tell you either
of course not
are you going to come tonight
yeah  i will be there later
i got lucky
there's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you  you made a difference
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future
do we have a future
i am not nervous
well you should be because this time i am going to win
well then this time you will have to stay for the whole match will not you
i do not have to go through with it either
me too
last night was the worst i dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other and walked like a penguin
mine was worse i dreamt you picked your nose in public
that is worse
you are really not bad looking almost handsome
well you are beautiful
you umightu be handsome i cannot tell through all that grime besides you reek of sweat and horses
if you are going to marry a warrior you would best get used to it
i have no intention of getting used to it
we are not married uyetu
well then you can go up to the parapet and i will hand the buckets up to you
never mind my ears go away
thank you but i can wait
i cannot
about what
i cannot wait either
no they watch me closely but they have not harmed me
in a great fortress in the mountains wait something's happening
i do not know it is a maze of tunnels i cannot see out
i will find you i will be with you
i know it
i love you lyssa i love you 
colwyn colwyn  i love you colwyn
all the passages are guarded
i do not know how
you have the power uwill itu
all directions are the same here
i knew you would come
that way i can feel the cold
it was a platonic kiss father
of course it was
you cannot reach her  through the door  quickly
i will not leave you here
you will do as i tell you you will try to reach ynyr the old one
i must follow the slayers they have taken lyssa
does the queen live
the new queen lives
turold's son was to marry her
we were married then she was taken by the slayers you must help me
your powers are greater than you know  have you ever seen one of these
in the old books it is called a glaive
there is no other way
but there is another entrance to this place
you have rope
i am too old to climb down a rope
you will not have to
reach out farther call to her
lyssa  lyssa 
nor will i till my bride is beside me
yes they will be more help than highborn barons
everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death
what do you see
darkness tunnels and corridors  wait
yes they knew of your first contact so they drove her below
she was very faint i was barely able to reach her
she is too deep the curved tunnel we saw is part of the vortex the place of the beast
but you suspect
you will know in good time
there is no other way you asked me why the beast had come this time
lyssa uwhyu
like you she has extraordinary powers he would make her his queen
can she be forced
no she must agree of her own free will
then we must reach her before she feels that pain
he thinks you betray him with lyssa  colwyn the waters deceive you
he sees betrayal everywhere he will attack us so long as he is conscious
you will tell me her name and we will go together
let us wish him peace
lyssa your bracelets bend them straight and cross them
where the spiral begins
i chose the wrong passage
she can see the beast
use your sword
what use is my sword i cannot reach her
cut ucutu
you are coming with us
it is my fate to die in the fortress
no you cannot know that
i can because i choose it
i forbid you
i found the body of the seer in the stream
what will happen
you have done it
i road them often in my youth
yes it is today
each to his fate
perhaps you think no man would return to me
i do not think that
i ache with it
let me comfort you
i cannot take comfort when she has none
then give me comfort sleep with me tonight
i cannot betray my bride
you will not then
i cannot
i doubt it the water is only an inch deep
it could have been quicksand i might have been sucked to my death  where is this place
a forest near the valley of needles
what business
staying alive
he saved our lives
my ufriendu
i have need of friends
no more my lord  my friend with ergo the magnificent by your side your enemies are dead men
uwhatu oh no better it was me there is not another good tomato within a hundred leagues
you and i will guard the fire
what else is left for a man without friends
smart as well as quick now what do you have to give us
how did you know i had sons
because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for
hah you do not know me boy
i know you
and in the few seconds before i dice you to crowfood tell me why i am going to follow you
so your sons will speak of you to your grandsons and your grandsons to their grandsons
to the place where death lives
it should be an interesting journey then
that i promise you
i compel no man to follow me on this journey
i am all right
why do they burn the villages there's nothing to gain
not sleepy either
those are not child's tear a child cries for himself a man cries for those he loves
i knew you would not be that is why i chose you
we must try to get horses
yes it will double our range  i know at least a dozen ways to get horses all cheap
these we will pay for
lad you have an unnatural desire to pay for things it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination
hand over your dinner
a flicker of talent
they do not exist except in the waters of the swamp where they will remain
what kind of friend do you think i am
the best but my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it
well it is true that if i received a royal command i could not very well disobey it could i
go i command you
yes my lord
those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men
at the gallop
perhaps if the pay is good
colwyn do not be a fool you cannot do battle with that thing
would you settle for a boar
a uboaru those incompetent louts could not catch a piglet much less a boar
the swamp of betrayal be glad we do not have to cross it
i am glad  i am very glad
we will meet you at the inn
cannot i come too
a small house
and mine goes with you
i have a cinnamon bar
you do
you can have half
i    am titch
smart lad  bring me my spices
one puppy why not wish for a hundred
i only want one
a foolish wish and you quell
first you desert me and now you mock me go back to your oneeyed friend
i do not think it is working
and do you think i am not going to eat myself to death this very night huh
would you desert your friends
no no i am with you boy
get me down from here you louts or i will turn you all into pigs
you had better manners as a pig
i am ergo the magnificent and i do not travel with thieves and robbers
many villagers are hiding in the forest they need food
and do you think i live on air
we have plenty of hares
food for crows
surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison
i am being exploited where are you going
i must take the old man to see some sick children kegan will guard you
oh my poor stomach
look at its insides
the forest is not safe these days you would best travel with us
and who is uheu that they should join uhimu
he is the king
no he will master the leader
then look
these walls do not lie he will betray you
he will not
then he will die
he will not come you will be my queen
barak is still strong in the north and tendo holds the high passes but the great desert forts have fallen
freylag's stronghold
it has been taken freylag and all his people slaughtered
it is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen
you knew you are a rude bumpkin
that i am my lady
a match for your son i think
a fine match
they will have the life that you and i might have had
yes we lost five
you were lucky i lost thirty there
sixty at the needle another thirty in the forest only ten of us made it back
we will have to try again his knowledge is great without it we cannot hope to win
he leads a group of slayers under the leopard banner
such a vision will be opposed who seeks it
the new king
with an old voice
you know the voice
yes you have left your place in the needle it is the time then
it is the time
i will seek the fortress for you
yes it is the western ocean
no they are sad solitary creatures rarely seen
there's an emerald circle a few leagues from here  we will find her
many have perished in that maze
no maze to me my fried it is where we take refuge when they hunt us
yes  like you a king a king of many worlds all enslaved
the widow of the web
she has the power of vision
she has the power to kill
perhaps she will not kill me for i know her name
her name is death
she had another name once
fewer will survive them
it is a hundred leagues from here
it is not necessary they will not follow
it is fifty years since i spoke it to you
i was beautiful then
the most beautiful woman in the world
but you would not stay with me

i will keep you safe we are both older
i am lonely yuri
with an old friend
yes of course how much do you need
all of it i need to buy many things all of it
it was a slow night i went to a hotel for a few drinks
like i said it was a slow night i am sorry it was hard to score
what do you think you are sixteen years old on hollywood boulevard
it is me yuri
yuri are you
sera please go
that is right
but it is a top three school 
i have a 40
i cannot tell you
you understand you are on trial for murder
insurance a love affair pure unadulterated hatred believe me the da will come up with plenty of reasons
i loved him
he was thirtyfour years older than you that does not sound so good to a jury
i cannot give you that and if you put me on the stand i will lie
go to hell
i will take that as a no
are we done for today
i believe we are
get up
he is the top defense attorney in the state of course he is an ass
but is he an ass that is gonna win my case
he is an ass that is gonna try
he thinks i am guilty does not he
that is not that is important
to me it is he does not trust me why should i trust him
i am glad it is you and not donovan
he means well he is really brilliant and all
who could better understand than me
whatever it is  it could save you
that is just it  it would ruin me
enrique's gay i am sure of it
he did leave a cher tape in the pool house once 
did she have a weapon in her hand
uh yeah because the bitch shot him
was there any evidence that mrs windham shot him
his dead body with a bullet in it
not that i saw but like i said i went straight upstairs to take a shower
and when you came downstairs what happened
i saw brooke standing over his body drenched in his blood
but mrs windham did not have a gun
no she would stashed it by then
no i was in the shower
so at some point in the  twenty minutes you were in the shower your father was shot
i guess
yes i was washing my hair
i got up went to starbucks went to the gym got a perm and came home
where you got in the shower
two a year since i was twelve you do the math
because they got wet
who's asking
i am elle woods ms bonafante's attorney
that is touching elle but we need an alibi
yes but i cannot tell you what it is
i promised her i would keep it secret i cannot break the bonds of sisterhood
he is gay  he is not brooke's lover he is making it up whoever killed heyworth is paying him off
thank you
is everything okay
you followed your intuition today and you were right on target i should have listened
thank you
about the alibi 
not really i know how competitive it all is 
you are a beautiful girl elle
so everything you just said 
i am a man who knows what i want
yes i am
but you agreed last night in the office when we were discussing my career
i saw mrs windham standing over the body of mr windham
was she carrying a weapon
no she was crying her eyes out
just the love in my heart
for what breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man
uh  both
forget it i have already spent too many hours crying over you
i think so
how about 
i do not know
well i recommend knowing before speaking the law leaves much room for interpretation  but very little for selfdoubt
cried a lot and gained twenty pounds dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby rufus i got jackcrap
so that is this sarah got that you do not three tits
she is from connecticut she belongs to his stupid country club
is she as pretty as you
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights but she is not completely unfortunatelooking
definitely i love him
look at him he is still scratching his head
which must be a nice vacation for his balls
no sometimes i say okay instead of fine
have you ever considered asking him if he would like a cold beverage or perhaps a neck massage
that is the point  look at me
i am and i am looking at a beautiful fabulous sexy woman
trust me you have got the equipment you just need to read the manual
how would it go at the trial
great donovan actually said the words good work ms woods he takes me seriously can you believe it
of course i can believe it you are going to make a great lawyer
licensed attorney or family member
uh  family
you know her
oh god was this like an rsvp thing
too bad you and i are the only ones
i am still cannot believe you did not tell donovan the alibi
i know i thought that was very  classy of you
really thanks
i know he has it sent out
did you know he got waitlisted when he applied his father had to make a call
you are kidding
yes you are
and donovangs a scumbag for coming on to you
yes he is
hell yes we have got finals to study for in jamaica
you guys are so sweet
i think you should go with red it is the color of confidence
well i do not want to look like i know that is coming
serious who the hell does he think he is you are the most popular month on the usc calendar
thank you i love you too
but is not it kind of hard to get into law school
i have the highest gpa in delta gamma
your scrunchie
my lucky scrunchie it helped me pass spanish
power yoga
picking out my wedding dress
no way 
i will
not yet
the professors yeah they tend to do that socratic method
and if you do not know the answer they just kick you out
did she do that to you too
wow i am glad i met you
thanks again for your help
i was not gonna 
my money's on the angry daughter or the exwife
uh for starters she will not give us an alibi 
aside from that
she is completely untrustworthy
but maybe it is not what you think
but maybe it is 
how do you figure
maybe not to your face
no she cannot move for an hour
we are here from austen platt jaret & donovan 
did your daughter ever say anything to you about brooke and heyworth's relationship
you are going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment she is lying
and you know this for a fact
did you see the icky black color of her hair
that is a direct result of anti blonde discrimination
wait  hilary clinton
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixtyyearold man can take
that is not really a topic that keeps me up at night  but maybe it should
the bags under your eyes you are an attractive man but you need to take better care of yourself
i do not   do that stuff
fine sorry i brought it up
for a butthead yes
gay men know designers straight men do not
law school was a mistake getting this internship was a mistake
what are you talking about you earned it 
oh my god
are you asking me on a date
as long as you realize i am not just some mantoy you can show off like a trophy
then forget it besides i have an early class tomorrow
so friday at eight
is he the only one
what do you think
helloo he just had lunch with his grandmother you know he got the rock
i am canceling the mixer we will blacklist sigma chi
thank you serena but i do not think it will do any good
what happened
i just do not understand what went wrong 
i do not know i do not know anything any more  i just need to be by myself
are you sure
what like on vakay
where is warner
i cannot believe you are a laker girl
i would rather have a client who's innocent
i changed my mind i would pick the dangerous one
you are applying for my internship are not you
i do not know 
you should do you have a resume
i do
and engraved gives it that extra little something does not it  see you tomorrow
she could make you drop three pounds in one class she is completely gifted
well in all likelihood she is completely guilty as well she was seen standing over her husband's dead body
maybe she found him like that
that is the story she will be telling the jury we just have to prove it
of course i do
has warner huntington checked in yet
uh no maybe you should try the lido deck
your what
you know  mixers formals beach trips
there's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes does that count
i guess it will have to
so are you
that is why i think it is time for us to 
you are breaking up with me  i thought you were proposing
proposing elle if i am going to be a politician i need to marry a jackie not a  marilyn
you are breaking up with me because i am too  blonde
that is not entirely 
then what my boobs are too big
elle  no  your boobs are fine 
how can it be the right thing if we are not together
i have to think about my future and what people expect from me
so you are breaking up with me because you are afraid your family will not like me  everybody likes me
east coast people are different
i am seriously in love with you  is not that enough
no silly i go here

he is here  check the bathroom
i checked everywhere  he is not there
it is so beautiful
mom said i should
i do not think dad wants you home
who are you
what color
that is wrong
and why was the alarm on
ohi set it to see if it would work
you would better call and cancel
oh god we do not want the police
i could not sleep last night
i am supposed to be mad at you but i am not
uhusing josh like that
has he eaten anything at all
i will survive
he seems lonely
are you his friend
i am living here while i build another house
is that legal
that is that
i am not shaving my legs or pits this summer i have decided
he is not gay  i found out purely by accident believe me
i mean drugs  i thought you said he was
he would not use around me  i do not like any of it
you are a good girl
i need to ask you something mr nelson
i want you to try something with me okay
maybe your tonguei do not know my mouth is numb  why did you do that
let's shut up and not kill her
what did you think it would be
i do not know  more like when i kissed sam
where to
i am supposed to be in tahoe
your dad's really gonna build his house
i do not know
well if you do not go i guess i will see you
i do not know
where is your dad
he jumped into the ocean
tell him i said hi
you look better without makeup
i cannot even take a shower here
come over to my house whenever you want i will tell my mom
i might not stay anyway
i will get your back
no  that is okay
no thanks
i am okay
his parents took his car  they are making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer
he can peddle over anytime he wants to for it
i am sorry  i am just here to shower
hand me a towel  i am getting out
i am coming in
i do not want you to
we are not gonna do anything
why are you so stupid
why are you so uptight
i do not evenwhat do you mean  i do not even know what that means
it means i am gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way
hand me a towel  hand me a towel
does everything have to have a point
it is freakish  i do not get it  i am not really supposed to touch you but i can look
what are you talking about
josh said
i am not gay
you are driving me crazy  do you know what it is like trying to jackoff in an armoire
not really
you are off you know  you are way way off
i thought i was helping you
it would help me if i could kiss you
no i do notno  i thought we were just friends
okay  i guess
are you afraid of heights
if he tricked me into loving him is what i meant
you would hate him for the trick
not if what he left me was real
he asked where you were  he wants you with him
i do not wanna go
floating to catalina
he is got a standing invitation
just i mean well you are here every single day
he is at work while i am here
i guess i would just be jealous if i were him
well he does not need to worry
if my kids and my wife were always at an exhusband's house i would worry
he is not the type to worry
will he talk to me
it could have been a squirt gun
you have been good this week
we have known each other since grade school
i mean but did you both go camping on weekends  listen to music  masturbate together  talk on the phone
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered
i have been dreading you
a violation
oh yes
and if i enclosed it
an exhaust system or a window is code
a sink
allowed outside the enclosed area
i flushed it down the toilet
if that is what it takes
well if it is we have a problem
what are you on
pardon me
how much weight have you lost
ohnothing  thirty pounds  i just have not been very hungry
how is your wife
when we divorce a decade ago she was very very angry  now she is just hostile
he buys and sells the world
peter webber  right  quite the spotlight on that guy
i did tell you did not i  that i would be ready to start the berlin model today
well that is sort ofyou are sure you are not hungry
all of us are typing and clicking george  whether we want to or not
i am not
maybe that is too long
i was a sophomore when i got the call my parents were dead
i hate this job
what are you talking about  you love your job
from the day i startedto today  cannot stand it
for everything
well i feel better about this now
good  i was hoping for that
what can i do for you george
well it is the least i can do
yes it is
she is out with a friend
ohdo you know when she will be home
she did not really say
i did not recognize you
i am sorry
alyssa said you do not even have plumbing over there
not a shower
i want you both to stay
thanks i would like that  thank you
thank you
you are here early today
we are getting out of the ground today
it is midnight  that is the matter sam
nothing  my dad's dying  i really need to talk to alyssa
he escaped  he is going back in
does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose yourpenis in plain view of my sixteen yearold daughter
there are no windows facing myexposure
george this is the third time
the plumber's due out on friday
you will have to explain that to the police
you were the only neighbor i could tolerate
i did warn you
my life is a warning  i just cannot figure out for what
and you thought they might be under her dress
i do not know
hey it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer
i know what the deal is  josh is a pimp i am not stupid
you do not know what the deal is  there is no fucking deal
to check up on me
i will be around to check up on you
why would you be there
because i live there
you live in cory's parents' cabin
no i am not
you will know me by the time we are through
i am not going
i will get your bag
you have everything
you do not have a choice
you cannot even begins to know how much i hate my father  think of it as a family tradition
i almost saw catalina
i warned you yesterday
do not touch me  you cannot touch me
no you do not
you snore at night  that bugs me  can i take you out
your brothers are right  it was the most godawful smell i have ever had my nose around
i am gonna take a walk  i need some money
you will have money when you work
you are so predictable
i would blame you  i want you here
i am not doing it
it will be fine
and i do not take a shower in the middle of the yard
i can promise you complete privacy
you will have money when you work for it
i do not know
when are you going to be back
i do not know
well until you know you cannot go
oh okay
a friend of yours is here
did you got through my pants
i might have a solution
you are too fucking late
the gloves on the table are for you
you cannot make me do a thing
sit down for a second
try it  it feels good
hi mom
i know  why
i like how it feels not to feel
how do you become something you are not
what would you like to be
what i am not
what are you now
see that is the thingi am what i say i am
i know parts of who you are
what do you know about me
i am telling you now
i gave up on you
i would be in tahoe having fun if you had given up
what would you be doing now
getting high i guess
if i asked you to stop would you
i have not used anything for two days i am trying
i am proud of you sam
do not be  and hide whatever that new drug is you have  i like it
to hide a black eye
why would not she leave
i think she was terrified of living with himbut maybe even more terrified of life without him
i would have killed him
after everything he did to you and your mom
after everything
that is so weird
i do not think mom cares that much that mythat peter left
she seemed upset
that is wrong with your back
no but i count them  in a sock is not new you know
the kind where there is not really an answer
i still do not know what that means
the kind where there is not really an answer
i still do not know what that means
you lied to me
i would have lied to me if i thought i would believe it
this was all for your sake was not it having me here  trying to get me to like you
i never tried to get you to like me  i tried to get you to love me
well congratulations  you fucking pulled it off
good for you
i would build a house
you know what mortise and tenon is
i can die trying
i have not been touched in years
left you this place
at least your father tried george
i know there's an explanation
i have not forced him to work  i only wet him down once  why would he leave
i need you to do me a favor
god you look like crap george
i want you to find someone for me
i do not let him  he just loves to
oh  sorry
it is okay
she needs to be alone i think
because dad left
she is a little sad is all
i do not even care if he ever comes back
ring the bell before you try the door
you let him pierce his nose
where is he
where he always is
he does not answer
why does he have a lock on his door
thanks for waking me up  picking me up you are loud today
you are inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion
you are the most beautiful woman i have ever known in my life
where have you been for a week
four days  i left to think
what did you do with your dog
kurt's been feeding him
but you cannot call me while you think
i was not thinking  look i am sorry i did not think to call you while i thoughti think
why would they tow your truck
i was parked in day parking
why call me
i am going to tear down the shack and build my house
you have been saying that for twenty years while we were dating you said it
there's nothing anymore to stop me
where will you live
the garage
fridaygod i hate the thought of him home all day
i will be by saturday to pick him up
he does not want to spend the weekends with you anymore
not for the weekend  for the summer
the garage is plumbed  i will put in a toilet  we will survive
thank you for at least sounding sincere
sounding  i need help  he is cheap labor
one of you would end up dead
at least we will have a house to show for it
forget it really  i will survive
i want him with me
no you do not  trust me
i am married
i drove over and you were gone
i cannot leave the house
last time you were gone for a week
did you tell him he was spending the summer with me
no  i was going to let you do that
he is not spending the summer in tahoe
let's go
well for later then
but you hated four out of the five you did
i was here six years  and i only hated two
sam's favorite
we have it on video  was that when  my parents were down for his sixth birthday i remember that
i am fine  nothing  i will drop by your lunch tomorrow
i dreamed about your house last night
finished or unfinished
it was perfect george  amazing  it was so real
did not you once dream you could lick people well though
that was not a dream  that was sam
ohwith his ear infection
my tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him
the antibiotics were not working  it is what i believe george
hindsight  it is like foresight without a future
you are not well
my stupid back
no i amthanks  i took something
he will not use my shower  i do not get it
or wound  let them keep their eyes and fingers
you are a good mother
i think so
this was my very first slow dance
i smiled at him
watch out for the smile boys
oh i am worse  much much worse
no  why  i like to be with sam
it is just that there's less that adam and ryan can do anymore  i would hate to have them bored
how much time do they get to spend with their dad
i can hire workers to help me
going on
when i picked you up from the train stationwhat you said
what did i say
that thing about i was the most you know beautiful person you had ever known  what was that
that was the truth
you have never said that before
i will say a lot of things i have never said before  it is habit
it sounded like a pickup line
i cannot pick you up
you bit my finger
if i were not married
i need to know
you need to know what  do i still love you
i did not think you would come today
peter left me yesterday
left you
no goodbye  no fuck you  no 'are you in love with george'
what did he say
'i will be in the bedroom'
so could i
it is not my back that is killing me
i am an idiot to have you up there
not a perfect day
does alyssa know
you got the money
do not eveni am there
i was not sure
i could use the money
i am sixteen years old  i am underage how could i possibly threaten you
everything happens for a reason  that is what my dad said
then you tell me what just happened
the payoff
his father is a man
a man he respects
is lois still here  i am starved
i will make you something
should i
it would worry me
what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you
i would be you
we should take a vacation
do you remember anything i have said that was not negative
sooner than the fall
lois will stay with them  or we can pawn them off on your parents
you cannot go because of sam
we have not been away together for three years  what difference does a few months make
you cannot go with me because of sam
i know
what are you doing home
you live a fabulous life robin
despite you
i never asked for more
that is the problem
please do not leave me
sam took them to a movie
i will be in the bedroom
that was my planto be hardly recognizable to you as me
i feel in love with george again
are you wearing eye shadow
if i walk out the door who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through
either do you
do you like red
it is not ours  it is george's
i did not go in your room
i locked the door  get out  i locked the door  get out
can you stay for dinner
depends on what i would give up on
i do not know what i am doing
i would not let adam or ryan see you doing it
this is what he wants
i read the letter  you read the will he wants you to keep it  to live in it some day
dad said it first
i just thought it would be nice
not all day  i will be home after lunch
can we really help build a house
someone stop her
yes it is
would you stop being ridiculous  your father wants sam home as much as i do
enough for drinks popcorn and candy
dad's home already
in the bedroom
better make it a week
is mae rose okay
she is doing just fine
and the baby
he is a big one
it is a boy well let's get a look at him
thought you would never ask biscuit needs some gravy
i am talking about a haircut
cost you a pair of nylons
hell with him it ai not that
not for me it ai not
cannot get right that is the kid's name can i talk to him
you can try but you will not get too far why you interested
crawford's are always looking for new talent
maybe you did not notice but this is a prison
there are ways around that right sergeant
kid's getting out i got him a pardon
but you cannot
at least the kid's getting out is not this what you wanted
is spanky here
no but
then that is the problem
do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door
she is alright is not she
oh she is fine she is just not coming today
why not
she got married last month
but i am not on the outside i am in here
you know go to the tonk or whatever
i am too old for you besides i am not much in the mood
want me to come back some other time
yes boss
that is alright boss takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings
you been on the farm for quite a spell have not you

nine millimeter a sig sauer 226

how does it affect you
i will probably kill them is that likely
no and no one is to know of your drinking problem that includes my wife
creasy where the fuck are you
i am here
what do you mean i am here
listen it was a calculated risk i have done it a million times and never got caught
everything happens once if you live long enough
it does not make sense to xray your bags coming off the plane
this is mexico they do everything backwards
nothing wrong
do not give me that bullshit
fuck i love mexico i live like a king down here
oh like you have not been in worse places
and a level five shithole is better than a level six your logic's inescapable
not for eight months i was in columbia looking around but nothing seemed interesting
how long you staying crease
got no plans rayburn nothing on just wanted to see you how you were came by on impulse
everything happens once if you live long enough
you are crazy people would hire a hasbeen ray a drunk
well you would have to keep it under control
and what if just say there was a kidnap attempt
you do your best they will not be paying you enough to perform miracles
a bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time willing to talk i am not good at that
so you will be the silent type people will appreciate that
i came to visit you
bullshit i have known you fifteen years you do not visit
a bodyguard who's the guy
take a job creasy breathe some air then decide if you want to stick around or not
you got tossed do not trust the cops especially the judicials  oh you know that
i mean nothing the hammer came down and nothing happened dimple on the primer
i have heard of it never happened to me though maybe the firing pings off
i will not kill again hunt people i gave that up anything else it is yours
i know it is old fashioned but it is reliable like us
different door not far from here
if they like me
frank does not take to most people do you speak german
ein klines bisschen [a tiny bit]
who's emilio
my last bodyguard he drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon
creasy just call me creasy
the united states
i know but which state
i am looking for potential
let me guess you would not stop talking
someone gave him more money than we could
i am a bargain
being black is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico
time will tell
that is right
so you were unhappy
being unhappy is a state of mind i never thought about it
i am not crying
i go to school do not i
once i get in the water but not starting off by the time i catch up it is too late
calling for emilio's macaw i thought i heard him
do you think he will come back
maybe did you hear him
well i let him go
it is better to be free right
yes actually he was driving me crazy
they can stay for two weeks i do not care
my ankle
white lie i did not have a family but i did have two kids they are adults now
i am too old for him do not tell my friends
i do not talk to them much does he have a name
you need to practice
it was in a book at school concubine
but the emperor of china had 1000 of them how can that be
in the west it is one wife for one husband but different cultures have different rules
it must be difficult having lots of wives
you feel sorry for the husband
[yeah can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand]
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there also i enjoy history
what did you do in asia is that where you met the man with cigarettes
no that was in columbia
do not worry you will
i guess that really does make me a hard case
yeah two or three
i am sorry
you were never late before i was worried
i dropped her at home
it is no wonder you are late why did not she just come with you
i know you are not
are you afraid of me
the gunshot holds no fear
there's no such thing as tough you are either trained or untrained
your father has business
why today and why would she have to go with him
i am a prisoner in them until the gunshot sets me free
could i stop you
you do not drink like you used to
that is not a question
i know because i go in your room and check the bottles
still not a question
my mom drinks too why do people drink creasy
yeah because at one time i did not think enough
frank frankie
there's no such thing as tough creasy just trained and untrained
then be trained
i am going to keep people safe someday just like you
be a swimmer
you will be back in the water in twenty four hours
it is war the weakest suffer the most
you are american
so are you
i am fine
is the food alright maria tells me that you did not eat
the food's fine sometimes i do not eat
we will be okay once she realizes i am not a new toy
yes she told me do you have children mr creasy
you are paying me to protect her not amuse her right
no you are right you were hired to protect her that is enough i am confident you will do that
it is serious mrs ramos
please it is lisa i will be coming with you tomorrow i have lunch with friends
because  i was already dead
planned what
then do not come
stay here if you do something stupid we will not get her back
it is creasy
where are you
los arcos was a little girl kidnapped recently about twelve maybe
last night do you know something
what was her name
camila camila valencias
if she pisses you off you get another one
do you know what she told me last night
yeah and if she was ugly
i know i just had to let one go because i could not afford him
her beauty fucks with your mind
for an american she understands this country very well
she understands men
[no why]
[he has a heart condition angina he responds badly to stress]
i am trying mom
we will see and thank your father in the morning a man always needs to be thanked
this is mr creasy
you do
he is like a great big bear  'creasy bear'
well think about going to sleep good night baby
do not forget your towel
you are going to miss mexican halloween the day of the dead
and bankruptcy where will that put me in the social strata
these people are professionals they do not waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt
lisa martin ramos mr creasy
do you have any family mr creasy
i think it is fantastic
you realize that you have brought a killer into the house
pinta loves school she would like count dracula is he took her back there
what who
pinta likes him too much  she thinks of him as a father
that is ridiculous
it is not
he has to go
she is young she will get over it
i was not thinking of pinta
[is that good or bad]
[he sounded strong to me stronger than we are]
[creasy is not a policeman my sense is he could be very valuable to us]
[and left three more dead men]
[no not by the rules of polite society at least]
[i think he is magnificent]
[you only give information so you can fuck me]
[a beautiful circle]
[i should start going for your tits first]
i am sure he is not though he is certainly adept at killing
i already ate
you just said it he is my friend nothing else to say
i read the file you and creasy have been seen quite a bit together
two tourists who never went home
you helped him get this job
that is what friends do
what happened to him what happened to creasy
this is my jurisdiction i want these men as much as creasy does
what was she to creasy then
light at the end of a long dark tunnel somehow she showed him it was alright to live again
and they took that away
you talked to walt
he is parted his moorings
i believe it takes both i would have to look it up
you are welcome to one of these whatever they are
they give you copies to burn
never this close
how you radar
you fixing to add overtime to a twelve hour day the union ai not gonna like it
well  i was going to name you chief surgeon  to consult on both shifts yours and frank's
hey that is great henry good thinking
sure you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake
that is right
back home
is there any reason why we should not know the name of it
no  or why you should
where you think you are boy they probably never seen a olive in this country
pour one for painless
he said it for us all walt
look at that right eye
epidural hematoma
i do not know what else you have been that route a little have not you
not enough to be a pro
there's only one way
or her figger
you really think we hurt him that bad
four goddam months and they do not even give you time off for good behavior
hey you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging bible
i have great interest for america his peoples and his custom

where you from with that crazy way of talking
crabapple cove maine
damn that must be about as far north as you can get
pretty near what do you know about the outfit we are going to
shore patrol duke let's go
i done my shopping in seoul last night
the spot we picked to spend the winter maybe we ought to look a little harder
finest kind we will sit where we can get the best view
that is right pal you just sit up front and sign the mail and leave the cutting to us
well southern boy i suppose you want the sack that is convenient to the door
and gets the wind every time it opens no thanks i will take that one
he cannot take much more time on the table
we been had
we sure do not aim to cause any trouble yeah she seems to grow on you
except we forgot one other small thing
that is that
the chestcutter
yeah that is right  you better get us a chestcutter before there's trouble
this outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded
and it is the ninth inning
you met him walt waldowski the dental officer
nice guy for an enamel surgeon
call dago red
not without lots of praying and kissing the dice  it is a different ritual but it works the same
what do you think trapper
get out the scotch hojon  do not mention the sex thing unless he brings it up
a native is someone who is born in a particular place
that is he got to write for god's sake
an application to androscoggin college
i not only say it i will back it up twenty buck's worth
you got yourself a bet georgia boy  you are a witness
all three of us played for our schools and there are at least four other guys
sure you have only as 'spearchucker' jones
the nigra boy with the philadelphia eagles
i do not think i could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer
same here you can retire my number
be right with you
we could steal one of the choppers
i looked suspicious bastards got them all locked up
plus running the opium concession for the whole eighth army
like the spearchucker said that is possible anyway it is been an interesting association
people will talk
i do not mind if we give them something to talk about
we are a good team
we think the same way
it is supper time  but you are not hungry are you
ravenous what about you
well sure if you are margaret
anyway we want to get this letter off
it is that disrespect for you that is what i cannot forgive them
i cannot could not
finest kind we are training hojon to be a bartender join us
you ever caught this bread and forgive our syndrome before duke
trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against
shut up or i will tear you apart
you mean hot lips screw her
nnno thanks ggeneral
damn right three to one as much as you want to put up
you betcher ass general
obviously you do not think so and i do not know why
we had a team at the 325th evac last fall i coached the boys myself
i think i heard about that
also i am curious whether she is a moaner or
i though you said we did not have a drop
i found a doner
we need medical officers for short arm inspection starting the first afternoon out
oh certainly sergeant my name is captain george limburger and this is captain walter camembert
oh i am not sailing with you i work out of the hospital here
if you do not know what you have seen why should i
hojon give the father some more martini
the black capsule finest kind thank you dr mcintyre
the painless pole plans to cross the great divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out
an eternal damnation
you want it straight medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving
no no that one
oh you want to play it straight  i guess i owe you an apology
'course it is not but how many chances do we get to go to japan with our golf clubs
so let's haul ass sergeant
i do not know why as long as it is light enough to see your caddie
that is the age of consent in this country
like the rock of gibraltar
okay but i will need you to help duke will you take that belly back there the australian
yeah and he is lost a lot of blood i am afraid it is hit more that just the lung
never mind the conversation do it dad
you aspirate the blood from the chest cavity damn there's more of it than i thought
if we do not get that pint he is in trouble
oh jesus
i do not get it
we will have to close this hole and make one on the other side
they are coming
we will cut him in on the bets we make and still have enough profit to send hojon to college
might make kind of a social issue not having any other negro officer
he can move in here with us
not necessarily
honey nobody as pretty as you could ever impose please sit down coffee
that is right we work well together
major burns is far from satisfied
it is my name maybe that sounds silly to you but
that kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization
sister if i knew the answer to that i sure as hell would not be here
well for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years
i think we could still have a chance
if you start the game instead of waiting you mean
we may be in trouble i cannot catch my breath i have got the occupational disease of oversized exathletes
it is possible
hang in there
no trouble at all  hawkeye
how did you get called that
'the last of the mohicans' only book my father ever read
it is not always this rough
oh no we have dull stretches every week or so thank god when there's nothing to do after midnight
they do not have to be dull i mean if you and me put our minds together
our minds
for a start i just have a hunch well it is not entirely a hunch
you are an attractive man
you have a certain modest charm yourself
but i am married
something else we have in common
very happily married
same here
and absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband do we have that in common captain
it is a matter of definition faithful in spirit yes
it is terribly hard sometimes the temptation is just too much
then why not as long as it would not hurt anybody
but you have made me feel strong again captain hawkeye  you helped me pull together when i needed it
you are leaving tomorrow
in less than twelve hours i will be on my way
that is when the real strain starts three weeks on a troopship  poor baby
dear sweet hawkeye
though i guess who it will really be rough on is your husband
you are on his side all of the sudden
a man would be more considerate he would not come home to his wife a nervous wreck
how would he avoid it as if i needed to ask
it could be a purely impersonal thing what matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions
you should have been a marriage counselor  but i will show you that is wrong with your theory
it happens to be a matter of life and death
a man is going to die if he does not have my fair young body
what do you care you will be on your way to japan
i am fond of painless and i would feel terrible if anything happened to him
it is your decision maria i do not want to highpressure you
i would be crazy to think my virtue such as it is was more important than his life
second pint
i did not have much choice
you really say the cutest things
excuse me sergeant
yes reverend
what do you want with those two medical officers
they are supposed to hold shortarm inspection
save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home
well one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eightpound americanjapanese male
that is wrong with him
let's get his clothes off quick
tell me the whole story walt
there's this native broad works in the laundry i do not know if you have noticed
there's only one worth noticing
what did you have to test for god's sake the dental don juan of detroit
no never in the slightest
just in dreams
or in dreams either i repressed it completely classic pattern of inhibition
well i am sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces
you guys got any black capsules
big day two jaws to rebuild
you can cut the bow
i have not understood what you means
that it is out of the act
right hojon see you later
finest kind captain forrests say you better haul ass home quick we got new chestcutter in our tent
i do not think so either
i  would not  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark
nope we are assigned heah
if you mean  she is a lieutenant in the army nursing corps captain
okay lieutenant dish i guess she is already involved with somebody here
they have all tried nobody's got to first base
that is all the commitment you are offering me  or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation
i will try dddammit you cannot ask any more than that
we do not want any more than that  right now
there's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another
you got to relax henry since the deluge started you been working in the or and running the outfit too
it is the only way we can make enough to put hojon through androscoggin
you mean who hit who
yes that is what i mean
i did first and only blow so far
i deeply regret this unfortunate incident we try to remember we are a military organization
i do not know i must have lost my punch i did not think the sonofa bitch would get up
yes sir
dammit radar wait till i call you tell major burns
one of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight
yes dammit and
i am afraid so colonel
we have got too many wounded for us to handle now get on the phone right away and
to major burns' tent yes sir
stop that o'rielly
yes colonel
morning radar how were things
splendid sir no problems
morning captain
i can try sir
the way i run an organization any man in it has the right to speak his mind
in that case here are ten basic plays i think that is about all this bunch can handle
i used to throw the javelin
they cannot do that to me
that is that henry
i outcoached that general hammond
good morning

what friend you are my only friend
you shall see
what are you looking for lie and i will slit your throat
something about bringing his dead girlyfriend back to life he needs the book  and your sister
that is one way of putting it
all i remember is him turning into a blast of sand and then i remember nothing
when ramesses destroyed syria it was an accident you are a catastrophe why do i put up with you
what is he doing here
do you truly wish to know or would you prefer to just shoot us
to have stopped this creature yes
 then perhaps the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld
no she has seen too much she knows too much
and burn the map and retrieve the key
it will be done but what of the american expedition they leave tomorrow as well
you will not believe it
try me
 and read the sacred incantations contained inside it
you think it will send this guy back to hell
correct and that is when 
do not tell me we gotta go back out there
if we want to kill the creature yes
for them to protect it like this you just know there's got to be treasure down there
yeah it is supposed to be made outta pure gold
water turning to blood
what did you do to him
yeah i am not leavin this fort for nothing
yeah get me a glass of bourbon a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser
i did not know so when i heard you were coming i asked him that myself

to be hanged
i am an english woman
i would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang
two hundred pounds
i would never
yes and if you cut him down we will give you ten percent
fifty percent

if you call that a kiss
the last time i was at that place everybody i was with died
ahmar is ossirion passageway to the underworld actually
i know my treasure
oh that is comforting
well of course i can swim if the occasion calls for it
trust me
are you sure
we are about to be shown the way
the things that get you excited
according to bembridge scholars inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment perhaps containing the book of the living

very slowly
it is just a book no harm ever came from a book
forget it we are out the door down the hall and gone
no we are not

alright then me i i read the book i woke him up and i intend to stop him
there goes that belief again not me i am outta here
it is everybody's problem
you can either tag along with me or you can stay here and play around with mister maggot
i am staying
the creature are you sure
what oh yeah that was just um you know figure a speech
i think you were jealous
jealous you kidding me did you see that guy's face
got what
i have no choice
yes i know and i would like to keep them
drunkard fool ratbastard please call me something original
right now i only wish to join them
he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all
alright good that is good i like this fellow like him very much
i was mistaken
you lied to me
i lie to everybody what makes you so special
i am your sister
that just makes you more gullible
you stole it from a drunk at the local casbah
picked his pocket actually
way to go evy
undoubtedly i know the breed he may be a cowboy but his word is his word
personally i think he is filthy rude and a complete scoundrel i do not like him one bit
after all you rode us night and day to win that bet
did you ever see him eat
do not blame me i do not even remember being there
well neither do i thank you
shutup and get me off of here
read the inscription on the cover
that is it look like
yes i see
yeah well i am sure she is not a total loss
um well you see
i only gamble with my life never my money
we coulda had 'em for free all we had to do was give 'em your sister
yes awfully tempting was not it
be nice that thing saved my life
and it stinks to high heaven in here
we will sneak up and steal that book right out from under them
and you are sure you can find the secret compartment
no kidding without a key it will take us a month to crack this thing
yes i am all tears now let's see who's inside shall we
what are you going to do shoot him
if he decides to wake up hell yes
rat gizzards they smell bad and taste worse but that is the best the desert has to offer
must of got a little too frisky with the pharaoh's daughter
that is one of the plagues right the grasshopper plague
the guy the priest the mummy
ya know ever since i met you my luck has been for crap
yes i know i do that to people
and then he will be coming after evy
and now he is going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
i am with you old man no one touches my sister like that and gets away with it
he is a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon
got it
you have got to be joking
if i may your majesty i would like to offer a dissenting opinion
general kutusov feel free to say whatever you like
well has your majesty considered what napoleongs alternatives might be if you simply chose to ignore his note
forgive me your majesty i am about to make it
ah yes  proceed
and what a delightful idea
ah  you approve
i think it is absolutely charming
i am glad you like it
whatever suggested the idea to you
what do you mean
i know absolutely nothing of war  and i am still totally dependent upon my generals
i did sir
yes with all due respect i do citizen barras
no thank you
things are quite serious i should say
to be perfectly honest i have not the vaguest idea
are you serious
i do not even know whether a defense is possible
what forces do you have at your disposal
about 5000 troops
any cannon
there are none here
where are they
well i believe there are at least 30 guns at sablons
you could have them here by daybreak
is this enough to oppose 40000 men
properly arranged yes
these are odds of 8 to 1
are you proposing to transfer command to me
in every practical sense yes but officially of course i would have to retain command
fair enough
you realize what is at stake
our lives the revolution my career
they are at the gates of paris sire
and where is the army
it is on this road sire following me
and who is defending paris
unhappily it is true sire
but where are my wife and son that is become of them  where is marmont  where is mortier
i do not know sire
and where is joseph
i do not know what has happened to prince joseph
i do not know sire  she had the tsar's personal physician
bertrand sire
i have just had the most vivid dream about josephine
yes sire
come back in an hour
excuse me general bonaparte but i believe this is an extremely urgent matter requiring your immediate attention
come in
let me see it
yes sir i had the honor of meeting them on the trip from paris
yes sir i am
was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied madame bonaparte's coach
yes sir
yes sir
did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip
no sir none at all
you may go captain charles
a glass of champagne please
yes sir  i hope you will excuse me for asking general bonaparte but are you corsican
yes i am
i thought so i noticed your name when you were announced  i am corsican too  my name is arena
oh  where do you come from
bastia  and you
i have not been back for ten years is your family still there
no they are living in nice now
that is a nice city  this is your first time here is not it
yes as a matter of fact it is
you do not know many of citizen barras' friends do you
ahhh no
i thought not  i noticed you by yourself all night
ah didier  you are alive
why are you carrying the dog
his paws are frozen and he cannot walk
when you eat him may i have some
my god  do not you recognize mouton  our regimental dog  i would rather eat cossack
four o'clock
my god what a fire
the first reports came in at about ten
why did not you wake me then
at first it hardly seemed more than a routine fire
how did it spread so quickly
it is the work of incendiaries
i told mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting
our troops have no part in this  it has been started by the russians
impossible i do not believe it
what is that
good morning sir  are you general bonaparte
i am citizen  is your mother madame josephine de beauharnais
yes sir  are you acquainted with her
i have met her  what is your business with me
he said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you
does your mother know you have come
no sir
well then you have a lot of initiative my young friend
my father's sword means more to me than any other possession i have
you realize of course that thousands of swords have been collected  how do you expect me to find yours
i fear our meeting is long overdue napoleon
shall we move closer to the fire
yes  an excellent idea
i very much doubt that he will
i see
i am afraid i am just a bit
would you like some brandy
thank you
i will have the fire built up
francis may i ask whether you wear warm winter underwear
good evening mademoiselle
yes it is  it must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter
yes it must be
yes i am sir
then what brings you out on such a night
well one must do something to live you know  and i have an elderly mother who depends on me
oh i see that must be a great burden
one must take life as it comes  do you live in lyon sir
no i am only here on leave  my regiment is at valence
are you staying with a friend sir
no i have a room at the hotel de perrin
is it a nice warm room sir
well it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street
would you like to take me there so that we can get warm sir
uhhh yes of course  if you would like to go there but i have very little money
do you have three francs sir
oh i am sorry about that
lisette la croix
that is a very nice name  where are you from
please sir come into bed or i shall die of a chill
oh yes of course
not even the slightest hint of something
you cannot be serious  it would not be good to become another husband out of a moliere farce
the comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already
you must not act impetuously
it is time to clarify the situation everything is over between us
are you trying to insult me
of course not but such violence of feeling makes me wonder
well you shall see
when is she supposed to return
only as a last resort  what are the councils doing now
and you seem in excellent health your highness
ah well my dear madame de montesquiou peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness
yes we introduced ourselves at the door
may i offer you a drink
oh i do not want to put you to any inconvenience
oh it is not the slightest inconvenience general bonaparte it is an honor to have you here
you are very kind madame de beauharnais  do you have some sherry perhaps
yes of course  hortense darling will you tell louise to bring some sherry
i thought i was  i was confused
and now
now i know that i shall die if you leave me
do you expect me to believe that
of course
were you in love with any of them
one had better legs
were any of them married
yes  they were the easiest  i made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting
she must have been in love with you
i cannot promise you that
promise me
i will never forgive you
i do not care but promise you will never leave me
i do not understand you
perhaps  but tell me you promise anyway
all right  i promise
you are my old friend
open the door  it is me
go away  i am busy
i know what you are doing in there
do not be ridiculous and go away  i am busy working
where is madame trillaud
how should i know  ask roquier  he is cleaning her dress
what are you doing in there
i will be there in five minutes  go back to your guests
five minutes
not be safe  what on earth are you talking about
it is me
yes yes please sit down  i will be with you in a moment
yes i am sure he is been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife
why did you give it to him
i thought he would be seeing you before i would and would give it to you
i must have the breakdown now where is berthier
he is downstairs  somewhere
all right thank you  please ask him to come here
well maybe he is only looking out for your best interests
what are you talking about
nothing  that is all i can say
that is all you can say  what are you talking about
that is all i can say
there are some things better left unsaid
you mean about my wife  you mean there are some things better left unsaid about josephine
you know that letter you showed me in milan  the one about hippolyte charles
you wrote it
i could not face telling you
you could not face telling me what
about hippolyte charles
what was there to tell
my god what do you think
do you know what you are saying
god help me  yes
how do you know
i know
how do you know
i questioned the maid and she admitted charles had been madame bonaparte's lover for several months
can you give me a drink please
yes of course  what do you want
i believe so  i believe madame bonaparte was not discreet in paris
my regrets my dear major but i believe you have been blocking the road
are you trying to provoke me monsieur
if you wish to put things on that basis then i will say good day to you monsieur
oh then you are
yes my dearest marielouise i am your husband
you are much younger and much more handsome than your pictures
yes i do  very much
will i be able to play the harp  it is an instrument of which i am very fond
of course my dear
you are so good to me  will you also allow me to have a botanical garden
you may have anything you wish my sweet and lovely marielouise
i am told that fontainebleau has many lovely views  i know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside
i am sure you will enjoy the french countryside
papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me
oh my dearest child  you must not worry about anything  i will teach you everything that you must know
those are extremely harsh terms
i did not ask her to go to war against me
has alexander agreed to this
yes he has
do you think alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator
what you are talking about is a gamble on moderation  when i gamble i prefer to gamble on force
and where do you place alexander
alexander and i are friends  we have reached an understanding
i am looking for monsieur george varlac who resides in the rue de frelicot  do you know him monsieur
very well citizen lieutenant  you have come to the right place for i am citizen varlac

you do not need to check the tape  i know what i said
uh he is rushing back from his tennis game sir 
so  let's go 
he told me to take you to his conference room
no  his office  i want a very private conversation  i do not want to be bugged
then his office will be fine
frankly sir it stinks  i have no access  i am lucky helms lets me have a staff
we will see about that 
he is nervous sir  he is heard you are looking for a new director
well he certainly is not acting like it
that is helms  he is sang froid a worldclass poker player
yeah  well i own the fucking casino
then what about this washington post crap  woodwind and fernstein
son of a bitch
either it goes to mitchell or it comes here
uh i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years 
we could get that
uh huh 
we could get a million dollars  we could get it in cash  i know where it could be gotten
nobody knows more about this thing than you do john
yes  i got the money
the president would like to know if that was the last payment
i will bet he would
is it
that is not the question john  the question is why is he paying
to protect his people
i am one of his people  the cubans are his people  and we are going to jail for him
howard you will serve no more than two years then he will pardon you
anyway they had to take her to bellevue  maybe she will stay this time
it is the fall of the roman empire are you blind  and we are putting fig leaves on the statues 
yeah i knew it  i knew it from '69 on and i said it all along did not i 
you do it
why me
'cause he hates you  it is worse when you get it from someone you trust
he is wrong you know  about kennedy lbj truman
how so
you think this is just about politics
i figured that out
i think he means the kennedy assassination
so you tell mitchell 
mitchell's out of his mind now martha just put her head through a plateglass window
jesus  through a window
who  not another goddamn cuban
he left his white house phone number in his hotel room
is it legal  i mean has anyone ever done it before
sure  lyndon jfk fdr  i mean truman cut the shit out of my investigation of hiss back in '48
in hiding  he sent liddy to talk to me
pay him
pay him  i told him to get out of the country  it is crazy to start 
no sir
we should set up a cuban defense fund on this take care of all of them
why not
no  i can do this because i have spent my whole career building anti communist credentials
i thought the gloves were off
well no place where they speak english  that way he can always say he was misquoted
forget it  ehrenberg's paid three times that much 
sir bob and i are gonna have to testify before earvings committee
it is marked  also there's june twenty third  and this year  march twenty first  those are the ones 
mr hoover was a realist
i trusted mitchell  it was that damn big mouth wife of his
at least mitchell stood up to it
there's no secrets here al
you know al men in your profession  you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room
i do not have a pistol
'night al
let 'em try  i appointed three of those bastards  i am not giving 'em my tapes
can the president afford to ignore a subpoena
for what
but he works for the attorney general only richardson can fire him
i am afraid we have another problem mr president
it is totally out of context  i was protecting the national security  i never intended 
sir the deadline is today
can we get around this al
it is the supreme court sir you do not get around it
and if i stay
lincoln used it
that was civil war
how do you see this
there is nothing in that statement the president cannot explain
sir you talked about opening up the whole bay of pigs thing again
that is right 
three days before on the june twentieth tape  the one with the eighteenminute gap 
i do not know anything about that
i know it well sir
it came over from vietnam you know
evidently to install bugs and photograph documents
it was just a fishing expedition apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc
their fourth
that fruitcake  what about him
i had nothing to do with that  was he  in the ellsberg thing
yes you approved it sir
i did
it was right after the pentagon papers broke  they went in to get his psychiatric records
fucking hell
we were working on china
our own intelligence capability  to fix the leaks
what do you mean sir
how about a comint classification  we put it on the huston plan  even the designation is classified
national priority
uh no one of course is going to see these tapes but 
just do what i say bob
yes sir but  do you think gray will go for it
pat gray will do anything we ask him that is why i appointed him
he will need a pretext  he will never figure one out for himself
christ you are right  gray makes jerry ford look like mozart  just have helms call him  helms can scare anybody
the only problem with that sir  it gets us into obstruction of justice
it is got nothing to do with justice it is national security
how is this national security
no no not tonight  do not let her in here  i have too much to do
the bastard  if i would called his shot on cuba i would have won  he made me look soft
dick you do not have to make a statement  herb covered it for you
what  that he knew johnny roselli hoover knew a lot of gangsters
yeah but roselli was not just any gangster  he was the gangster who set up track 2 in cuba
before  eisenhower approved that
you never told him

my job unpleasant sometimes is to know what others do not want me to know

cuba would be a small price to pay
so president kennedy thought
edgar think twice  he works in the kitchen
not joaquin you idiot  nixon  did you hear what he said in oregon about me having too much power
it is between nixon and a kennedy again edgar  who do you want

jews and negros do not win elections henry  better to hang them around the democrats' necks
but it must be done your government is paralyzed
all kinds of shit would come out like the ellsberg thing  you knew about that henry did not you
i  i heard something  it sounded idiotic
idiotic  yes i suppose it was
do you ever pray  you know  believe in a supreme being
uh  not really  you mean on my knees

that was mr kennedy
you do not think he was a hero
did you cry when he died
how did he do that  all those kids  why do they hate me so much
looks can be deceiving 
we know you have taken a great risk in inviting us here
that has the added virtue of being true
i was the lesser of two evils
the real war is in us  history is a symptom of our disease
you just came down here for the weather right mr nixon
i came down here to close a deal for studebaker
free if you are the president
kissinger's misunderstood  he pretends to be a liberal for his establishment friends but he is even tougher than i am

that one is a bit more difficult
that is a separate issue
i consider them linked

this is what he was doing
there's a slight difference
yeah those guys too
graham's got something to tell you might interest you
maybe he did
we are going to look for him want to come along
i have got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed
and that is more important than finding lednov
like you said maybe he knows where my ranch is if he does he will be waiting on the porch
nobody the light was bad
i would not know did you ask her
all i can get out of her is she do not care about living
look of things she does not
yeah keep a closer eye on her   and him shooting going on we will never find lednov
maybe you will not feel that way after i tell you what i stopped in for
and one of 'em is sick
why did not you say so go right out and get her ed build the fire up
no we came down the hill a little fast and  the wheel broke  can you fix it for us
too much excitement how about the surrey can you fix it
it was a gift from the citizens of aspen i am mary wells
i am clay phillips  my brother steve
as far as  sonora
just about
did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over sonora pass it is quite a job
you cannot leave us here
course i cannot i will give you a lift to the first ranch
you can stay here if you like
we have to get to sonora there are jobs waiting for us there we will pay you for your trouble
i am not running a stage line ma'am and i cannot take a chance on losing the horses
you will have to drive  except down hill
too much excitement or maybe it is just the heat how about the surrey can you fix it
i am clay phillips  my brother steve
it is a nice place owned by an old couple named wyatt
steve and me we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp
but you eat do not you
mostly we open a can of beans and boil some coffee
where do you keep the can opener
and look at it this way how about jim  it puts him in a sort of tough spot
i am not in his shoes so leave me out of it
would you mr phillips
go on there's a good boy
like sticking his nose into other people's business
he is learning his letters
yeah while the horses wander all over the country
are the horses straggling or are not they
they are straggling
his letters will keep
can we get a doctor at that ranch
did not you know she had a father and mother out here
we cannot stay here
it is a long walk back to aspen
i hope so too
i suppose it is
and it is not only because the trip's a tough one 
i could not leave you sitting by the road
the who
you should know she is in your dream
but the rest is right
will she be dark or fair
blonde as a new mop and beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar
that is fine
it is too light yet
you are not going out to look for them
why do you think
so that is it   you think i was making fun of your girl in gingham
yes but  that was the other night now  i do not think i would
maybe it is better that way
you do not mean that clay
i do not expect anything a minute ago i had not cuite waked up
then let's get started the sooner i get to sonora the better i will like it
i suppose that is my fault
that is right  worry about your clothes 
if you want to go on i can make it all right
like i said i was thinking of the horses
i am sorry
it is going to sonora
fine  maybe i will see you there sometime
hurry up
goodbye mary
by the way if you ever go past the wyatt ranch have another talk with elaine
thanks for loading me on the stage i know now why you did it
like i said women get in the way sometimes
to the other side of the street
then do not come sneaking around a mangs camp
so did i they were in it
she is a friend  took off this morning sort of sudden while i was not around
hello miss wells
it would not happen to be this
which ranch
how is that
a little hot
i do not see no sense to making people leave town if they do not want to leave
a man i used to know
like what
i do not want to run short
you never said this lednov's name before that i can remember
no call to that jail looked pretty solid to me  how is she feel
you sure worry that bone he killed a fellow
in a fight
the other fellow was not even looking
maybe at the ranch maybe sooner than that
do you have to be so closemouthed i am your brother and i am riding with you remember
all right i will tell you
and meet him there
unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up
yeah  and lednov's only looking for one man me
things get tough next winter you will have something to wear
how would you happen to miss
they were quite a ways off and the wind was blowing i did not have them to aim
good thing you did not
that is right steve
can i have my gun back
sure you will find it under the wagon seat like i said before a twenty two's more your size
i will not again
you remember jeff rawson  we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high
sure i do went off down to mexico or something
that is what i told you then only he did not lednov killed him
oh that is the time you went away
but you never can tell why do not you get that new rifle out of the wagon
there's only two of them now
i am not but there's some of it i do not see any sense to
just the grub box and bed rolls
you better start
that ai not why i just figure it is about time to start running my own life
i will eat when i am good and ready
sit down and eat till i say the word you are doing what you are told
you oughta say you are sorry  that is what you oughta do
you keep your nose out of my life young fella
i do not care what she asked you
she told me not to fight with you anymore she said it was not your fault but  i figure different
you want to split up 
you will get your share go on i do not want you around
sure what other reason would there be
i just wondered let's go
kind of sore
you will live
guess maybe i am old enough to hold my own in a fight huh
yeah  but do not make a habit of it
so  maybe i am old enough to tell you how to run your life
i guess so  but do not make a habit of it
three men on matched roans
the whole state's looking for 'em  and they are looking for me
all right you did not know
i cannot take her with me
nobody asked you to
that is there to be fair about
all right you did not know
i cannot take her with me
nobody asked you to
that is there to be fair about
i do not care
suppose that lednov was to have found you instead of me why you would not have had a chance
i said i did not care
that is bothering you anyway
do not ask me because i will not tell you i will not tell anybody go away
do not act so  crazy
i am sorry let's go

if she says anything to them i will kill her
me snooping i came down here to take a bath
no but it is mine and i did not want anyone fooling with it
just a thing i was working on
the way you act it must be something pretty secret
you would not have a smoke on you would you
i like it
up here in the hills a man gets a hankering to smell powder
then why stay in the hills
plenty more  and somewhere up there's the lode the rock rotten with it
well say it
yes people make me restless
even women
there are not any women here
i suppose that is your wagon in the river
go ahead
they went on like i told you

i do not care what he thinks
everybody knows 
who brought you here

i do not want you to get hurt
he cannot hurt me if he is dead
you better get in there with her until this thing is over
that was my plan
oh yeah you two are going to get along fine you got a lot in common
i would not worry about that
i thought you two would get along
a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions  also bogus
oh no  the fan club is real  but they were worshipping computer code  ones and zeros
so of course you could not kill simone because there never was a simone
of course
it was not her body  it was her body of work
why do not you just come clean viktor  tell the truth  you will feel better afterwards
i am telling the truth
we have a daughter together  i just do not want to see viktor get hurt
thanks  this is my exit so i 
i am glad we talked
we do not need a name  we will cast an unknown
excuse us
difficult  i am difficult
hmm mike and ike's
 overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career am walking around with a pocketful of cherry mike & ike's
 illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth
the picture's dead
so there's no problem  i can have the rights the negative too
they are yours  but how are you going to finish it  without a star there's no movie
good to see you too elaine
why is not she with you
why  because she would never show up at something like this  she is intensely private
do not thank me  it was entirely simone's decision  do you have simone's check
i cannot wait to meet her
i do not know if that is going to happen
why not
out of the question  a circus like that
viktor it is my studio
she is my actor  there are other studios elaine  there's only one simone  leave the press conference to me
no problem  do you want to come in
why not
there are not any  if the filmmakers are happy simone's happy  she considers herself an instrument
really  oh so she is really going to do all this nudity
if it is on the page
she will drive herself
hair and makeup
she will do her own  theater training
she was in the theater  when where
i will send you her resume
al least a contingency for wardrobe  any woman can go up a dress size
 i guarantee she will not gain an once  she is very disciplined
well we have to do something about this  stuntwoman
what about it
there is not one
no need  she does all her own stunts
even the fall from the plane
even the fall from the plane
well shoot it on the last day
not today  she is learning her lines  you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget
i will walk you out
viktor i have a feeling  one of my feelings  there's something about her i do not trust
thank you  what did you think lainey
that is genius viktor  was that simone's idea
who else  it is always simone's idea
better late than never
i should fire you more often  the film's looking wonderful
you really think so
i would love to tell her myself  when are you going to let me meet her
soon  soon
everyone i know has met her viktor
everyone you know is lying
that is true
 we have to talk to her viktor
 i can explain
viktor you should have said something
she does not want pity
you are so good to protect her like this
i will try  maybe live but remote she will never go to them
she said you were very beautiful
i would love to  but are not you supposed to meet up with simone
oh yes  of course  do not i always
no of course not  why  would you care if we were
do what
whenever i compliment simone you take the credit
i do
yes you do  anyway tonight was a good start
excuse me  start
it is a crowded summer  we need every photoopp soundbyte and column inch we can get  good night viktor
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate
i can imagine
when is she coming over
about now  would you like a drink
i suppose i could stay just until she arrives
not quite
i know  i know  they will say anything
 and she was positively glowing at the awards  i should be going she will be here soon 
i want you back too viktor
i would rather have you than simone  believe me
of course she will  her public will demand it
not if i do not let her
how can you bring that up at a time like this
do not thank us too fast viktor you know what we have to do
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast
exactly  now that you have the studio behind you we can really do things
that sounds wonderful  how do you feel about all this lainey
no it is life
yes  oh my god  is that you simone  i have been wanting to talk to you
well here i am  you look pretty today  red suits you
where are you
right beside you  i borrowed viktor's car
it was a great show dad
just a minute
i know it as surely as you are sitting here sweetheart  she was the most vital woman i ever met
so you did meet her
of course  what are you suggesting
i mean really meet her  in the flesh
 we do not believe daddy because we do not want to believe we were taken in too
lainey there's no evidence that simone is not real
listen to what you are saying mom is there any evidence she is
he also happens to be the most talented man i have ever known
i have to talk to her
of course
you look so so
 so much like her
yes of course but very beautiful in your own right
i do find myself physically attracted to you mr taransky
do what you do to simone
what i do to simone
yes call me simone
is that a problem
please put your clothes on
that is a good question  as nietzsche said whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else
let's talk about the work that you care so much about
sure  where would you like to start
how about the nudity
nudity has just never been an issue for me frank  for me clothes are just an option
what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects
frank you know as well as i do living in a fish bowl the insatiable appetite of the media
and what may i ask brought this on
it is a remake hal  anders is not bigger than this picture
hello hal
the film  the chemistry  no reflections on nicola but simone and i  we were just so right together
you never were together hal
really  she did not mention it
it was more in passing
body double
for her
viktor clyde simply has to get close to simone in this scene  he has to touch her  he has to
absolutely not
but she is right there  i must feel her
you cannot
why not
there's a wall between you 
 an emotional wall i know that is why 
 no  no  a real wall  you ran right through it
how did the wall get there
i am fine hal  how are you
somebody said she was here
i know what you mean
i have to talk to her about my experimental film  it is very experimental
i did it mr taransky  i licked skin  i licked hair  i licked every part of her
you want me to call security
i have her mr taransky  the answer to your prayers  the answer to this
i was misquoted
i have your new leading lady   right here in my pants
 eight years ago  in that whole time i never left my computer
good for you hank
do not be  it was worth it
i have seen them all before
not like this 
come on hank  a synthespian virtual actor  
 we call them vactors
i need flesh and 
 flesh is weak
 a living breathing actor  i cannot work with a fake
i do not know anything about computers
that is why you are so perfect  you have something i do not have
that is that
straw god changed my life
you saw that
i will not be here next week  the tumor's inoperable  i will be dead
i am already dead
i just came out to support my good friend simone
there's a rumor that you are more than just good friends
we have been seeing each other sure but we would rather keep our relationship private
do i hear the sound of wedding bells
i cannot believe you people  no wonder she never comes to these things
hello sweetheart
it is really not anything lainey  it is just 
i know you will do it dad  you are viktor taransky
hello lainey
she is at the premiere of a cold day in hell  but i think she send someone from acquisitions
she still with kent
this week anyhow
 you finished the film on your own terms that is what matters did you really do all the post yourself
there was no other way
i missed you  i wondered if you were ever coming back
me too
well i cannot wait to meet simone that is her last name
you know i do not know
is she here tonight
she cannot watch herself
i saw her picture on the er internet  you really did not notice anything  unusual
okay  but you have to find a way to escape that thing
i do
you do  still  i cannot tell you how happy i am to hear that
you were the one who insisted on it  reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four
you understood them  that is what was amazing  it is a nice day  let's eat outside
if anyone asks about simone 
 i know i do not know anything
exactly  do not you wonder where i am really hiding simone
i am sure you would tell me if you thought it was important
i know hal is as stiff as always
night lainey
i do okay  how about you
you know me  married to my work
i noticed
she thinks you are with simone
lainey you know simone and i do not have a real relationship
too impersonal  they have to meet facetoface
i love you too daddy
she did did not she
it is fantastic  it is too much
it is the car she drove in eternity forever
i know  thank her for me
why not  i can get you something else  what do you want
me and simone  what i did
an insanity defence
max sayer  national echo
do not you have a real story to write  why are not you in latin america
this is the story
i remember when the echo had class  the paper that could bring down governments
it is a yacht
i know what you are up to
i do not have time for this sayer
i think you do  i know it is a fake
the background is
she was never in new mexico  she never left the studio
 i bet you have
er good
looks familiar does not she  no one comes from nowhere taransky you turn over enough rocks
she looks a lot like you
she has not uttered a word that whole time  until she saw the big show
that will not be necessary  sooner or later i knew you would crack this thing max  you got me
no  thanks  absolutely
do not you
this should take care of mother
maybe he is talking to himself
taransky is not that good an actor no they are taking special precautions  some kind of new encryption
24hour tail on taransky
which means they are significant  incriminating  perhaps criminal  she is hiding her past  she is hiding her past
i will when you are finished writing it
what do you want  
mr sayer did we pay the million bucks yet
is that why she left you
i do not understand
could they have built that hotel since yesterday
you are in breach
 is this about the new pages  i made the changes you wanted you are in virtually every scene 
taller  what
i had three other offers  i only signed on to this picture out of loyalty
then show some  they will shut me down
yes i would like that
thank you
you could play the lead
but that is simone's part
no of course not you are right that would be crazy
let it burn  simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy
i am sorry i did not catch that what did you say
i will do anything to please you mr taransky
i certainly am mr taransky
 what you do not understand 
good morning mr taransky
a star is
buy it  they are paying for it and around here that is how you really know they buy it
yes  yes it is
no  i just helped bring someone else's dream to life
mr taransky we both know i was nothing without you  i was computer code  ones and zeros
the only real truth is in the work
you know what i am talking about

what are you doing here
my debrief 
 will be handled back in 
 no we need to handle it now
 you can and you will
you are finished
he does now
information was arriving all day yesterday when we finally figured out who sparazza actually was we 
almost  what do you mean who sparazza actually was
the same year that sparazza murdered agent freeman heller
i would not go that far
no we are trying to save heller
so you knew all this and yet y
 we needed cohesion to move forward not conjecture
while carruthers and a dozen others lie dying you debate semantics the bureau's betrayed us  the way they betrayed him
i do not see it like that at all
yeah sid
you got clicks anything
nah nuthing on my end 
 okay hang on i gotta move 
 he is doing it then huh 
fucking a first survive yes
y'gotta y'gotta but d'ya think they will kick ransom for that little prick assuming we get to'm
 who can say he is off his onion y'know he is old school sicilian this is how they hate
chances are they are gonna get into some shit too hafta put people down
that is not a problem are we going outta pocket ourselves
yeah i can front this
well just so i got a quote in my head that is the rate for the swede
that is the punchline y aready
no shit
none whatsoever
yeah sid
right you got clicks anything
nah nuthing on my end 
good this thing's on track looks like it is gonna get done
fucking thrilled t'hear it so the scout the sitdown y'musta felt it from 'em then huh
cold blood sid dead eyes y'know
okay  yeah i can i respect that
how are we on time
well uh  damn alright so he is headed in does that  where does that leave us
okay well y'know then we just gotta get israel
i am working on it
bag this fucker buzzy
it is getting done sid
 good then all you got to be is grateful
no doubt that is my moms there taught me them skills
you love her
my mamma c'mon shorty y'gotta ask  you hurting pretty bad
got hit twice
mmmhmm and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em
that takes some of the sting out
i probably woulda busted on you too and what a shame that woulda been
what were you doing here anyway
'spose to kill this fool named buddy israel
what are we talking on the split
a fed like fbi
it is just a little casino inspection do not trip he is alone  alright let's set this spinning
jus' remember this is more rescuing shit than rampaging shit what are you shooting
girl y'know i had to bring big mamma through
damn this kevlar riding up on me i wish they made this more sheer
i ai not trying to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga
damn why you tripping like that
fuck you
no but that definitely sounds like shots and i do not where it is coming from 
 it is your ifb somebody else has got an earpiece you are picking up their signal 
 i thought we had secure frequency aww girl tell me this mafucka ai not going off right now
security's locking down the elevators
c'mon i say we bounce now kick it for a lil' bit play some craps  maybe spend the night
what are they doing right now
jus' keep doing y wouldamage girl keep these mafuckas off my as
that is the time frame
right mafuck'n now girl fast as we can get you there we wait any longer someone going dead this fool
they have got two monsters now  both boys
and so that is with steinhart  is it serious
you did not like him
looks a little constipated to me
it is called solid nice to find someone you can count on win
you still writing the occasional magazine article
it is okay i have never been a detective before either
hard to find doors in this place
i think maybe that is not such a great idea
lieutenant garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger is that true
right  that is true
can we go then
i am supposed to call in
there's a phone in the car
oh yes i do not have it with me  it is at home
he thinks you are being a little careless  he made the point several times
queens you know queens
my father founded a music school there  the milton gregory school
nice  maybe you will stop by have an aperitif
no ma'am
beg pardon
since you are going to be my escort you will need a new tie
i got money
not too sure about that
hey  there are crazy people here
let's get a drink
ah i should not on duty
i will come with you
i think i can probably do that on my own
i came on at 800
listen that was my fault
i should not have listened to you i should have followed you right into the can the way he did
sooner the better
he said he would kill me
big talk desperate guy
right  how could he do that if he is in jail and they have thrown away the key
urdu and hindi
yeah what a woman
nope never finished one yet  i hate these things
you were reading my renoir
how did you know
you put it back in the wrong place do you like renoir
they are kind of fuzzy
you know why they are like that he was myopic going blind
no kidding
could be i guess
want to go out for a drink  i mean we are both sitting here and joey venza's in jail
yeah i like that  where you go i follow
absolutely  look at this
no no seriously  there's a study done on this you walk this way the muggers are gonna single you out
and die laughing because you are walking so stupid
hey  this is my business  do i tell you your business
okay  let's just see if a mugger gets me
yeah  it was
and is
no dog
i saw you with a dog in my mind
no dog
but nice
very nice
you do not like him do you
that is to like
tell it like it is
you asked
he is very caring in his way  you have not seen him at his best
you could do better
i will miss you mike
yeah  i liked being around you too claire
sleep good
open the door will you
i cannot open it
it is just me  i want to talk to you  let me in
no you will be safe  we are gonna pick him up again
claire will you calm down
i am perfectly calm i am a normal human being  i am going for a walk in the park
let go
stop being nuts
i trusted you  i thought you cared about me
i do care about you
she is okay  everything's okay
this is me mike  there's nothing else
not exactly
what do you want to do
i do not know
oh i do want to know  i tried to reach you at the precinct
are you okay
i am going away after that the next morning
i do not know  garber's left orders here not to let you in the building
tomorrow night  can you come
i do not know  it would not be very smart
listen you are right  do not do it i will just send you an address okay
i will think about wednesday
do you dance
do you
pretty bad
let's do it
i know
i know
 do not explain
long enough
yeah  it is all over
i do not know
you do not have to now
i think it is probably still a good idea
listen i will see you again
you have a weakness for lady cops
i do
you take care
it was something my father always liked me to do
you are planning to speak
not if you do not want me to
well of course we would be honored
just putting in an appearance then
 i do not want to talk about it
win made his choices claire  we all do 
and i am making mine
sure we are let's go
i do not know tommy
too kinky
take my advice do not buy any
your what
my ass is falling  it is
what are you talking about
i just saw it in the mirror it does not look like my ass anymore
get in bed
what am i gonna do  i jog i do the exercises on tv in the morning gravity
you got no idea
imagine i am sleeping with a dt
not great  i have got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide
until they pick up the perp  seniority gets day shift you know what that means
just keep it someplace safe but handy
i think televisiongs a dangerous thing
it is twenty bucks in the bank
let 'em eat their hearts out
well actually she looks better than that
oh some shit
what shit honey
you do not want to hear about it
i would identify him
i might stop you
no  no  i am sorry  ninetyseven five right
where would you get the tie
it is not your taste
what did she say the down payment was
she did not like the other one so she picked this one
she took you shopping for a tie
i had to follow her to a store
that is wrong with your paisley tie
ellie it was a formal party
excuse me  you went to a party with her
i am her bodyguard goddamnit
i know you are her bodyguard  did she buy it or did you
she bought it
few minutes  want to catch the news
should i wait up  we have got to get up early for the beach tomorrow
i will be right up
take it easy  i set her up  i saw it coming
it is not your fault  mike please get off the case
it is my fault  i am responsible for her
did you hear what i said
did you hear what i said
i want you and tommy to stay with my mother
d'you have to say fucking every other word
what was that
you heard me
jesus mike somebody's been feeding you a line of crap
what are you talking about 
i am sorry
i am not saying it is your fault
i watched tv
what did you watch
i do not remember michael go to sleep  you do not have to make conversation with me
well  this will be over soon venza's such a nut job we are bound to pick him up soon
i already did  i mean i talked to his wife and she talked to him
you talked to his wife
that is the difference
what about tommy
he will live through it  they all live through it  what a world huh
me neither
i just sat and listened
safe and secure is how we want her until she id's venza
when i want your advise keegan i will make an appointment
you apprehended him after he gave himself up 
it was not a bad bust  he gave himself up because he knew i was gonna nab him
anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail
even joey venza
i heard
it should have been me
call me next week  we will talk about it
call a cruiser
koontz  i need you guys
we will call swat  we will get the locals  throw it
no i need'm now
right behind you tj
do it or look for another profession  that is a choice i guess
you in this with me
yeah  seniority gets the day shift
be happy  he is good at this
it was my fault tj  fuck
i just gotta talk to her tj
ever shot anyone
no sir
i asked for the man in charge
that would be lieutenant garber and he is very busy upstairs
do not tell me he is busy  i asked for an ambulance for this woman and
is she injured
she is not a suspect sir she is a witness  could i ask you to step outside please
no i will not step outside
i am relieved at 400 am
that is right you are gonna do what i say  joey  i want to help you out of this
you should'a brought the girl
i brought the girl  she is outside
i will prove it
i will bring her in  you let them go and i will bring her in
why should she come in
she trusts me  she will do what i say
bullshit  prove it
i get my hostage first  no one's turned loose until i say so
let my kid go
i am not letting no one go
put him under the table or i will stop her from coming in
i will take his place all right  put the gun to my head
what the fuck you doing
my special scrambled eggs surprise
scrambled eggs surprise
i know where everything is
except the goddamn skateboards which are everywhere  i would like to kill the guy who invented those things
lay back mack
lay back mack  that is this lay back mack  where does he get this
just lay back mack lay back
yeah i think so
okay i guess
how about dinner tonight
mom and i got plans
what plans  you and mom got plans
she is taking singing lessons
she is what
we are gonna pass the street
so what are you doing tonight
i do not think she can sing either
take care pal
it is not our custom to have guests here at all let alone hold anyone against their will
your directive apparently does not include spying on other cultures
capability yes but where can warp drive take us except away from here
then you must spend your life answering questions
data if you were following the boy and discovered this ship
but not you
there are days
you do not live up to your reputation as an offlander picard
in defense of offlanders there are many more like me
 who would not be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth i do not think so
more questions always the explorer if you stay long enough that will change
will it
when time seemed to stop and you could almost live in that moment
seeing my home planet from space for the first time
it took us centuries to learn that it does not have to take centuries to learn
i just have not gotten around to it yet
 an offlander
for someone so young
by now the songa have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do
i should warn you i have always been attracted to older women
this way
i thought it might begin the healing process
i will be here
the mighty federation could learn a few things from this village
you are what
i am better
i understand
i do not
i know why  so people like us will not be afraid of you any more
perhaps that is true
my power cells continually re charge themselves
i cannot imagine what it would be like to be a machine
i play the violin and my chess routines are quite advanced
no i mean
for what purpose
because you are it and if you tag me then i am it
but i can run much faster than you i am capable of exceeding fortyseven meters per second
data have not you ever just played for fun
androids do not havefun
why not
no one's ever asked me that before
if you want to know 'what it is like to be a child' you need to learn how to play
no i want to stay with you
it is safer there i will join you shortly
data does not breathe
will not he rust
if not for data you would probably have been relocated by now
and our people
they all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production probably the result of the environmental anomalies here
are they in any danger
'yewcheen cheffaw' my collar size is exactly the same as it was at the academy
sure it is and your hair is still chestnut brown
your captain used to cut quite a rug
they should be quarantined before joining the ship's population
yes but look at this medscan
is it safe to move her
safer than leaving her here
captain geordi
you are aboard the enterprise
that is the last thing you remember data
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl'
from the mission
it is nothing personal data you have to remember these people have rejected technology and you
 i am the personification of everything they have rejected
until this week that young man probably never saw a  machine let alone one that walks and talks
and i do not believe i made a very good first impression
how about a passive radiation scan
it is clearly federation in origin captain
'just a few loose ends to tie up'
what you are seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields
what possible purpose could a duplicate village have except to deceive the ba'ku
i do not know
good let's begin to move these people out
another fortythree people reported taken sir
will the structure hold if we blast through
i believe it is safe sir
our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk
planet's population six hundred people you want to avoid unnecessary risks next time leave your android home
another time
i prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the federation
he is right our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies
talk we should send down an assault team and take them by force
that is not an acceptable option if people get hurt all the support we have in the federation
picard's first officer do you really believe he will listen
in six hours every living thing in this system will be dead or dying
it is not over
it is over
if you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated the federation will pursue you until
 and now he is holding our people hostage down there
the enterprise can be at your position in two days admiral
that is probably not a good idea your ship has not been fitted for this region there are environmental concerns
what kind of concerns
this was too important for the enterprise to be on the sidelines admiral
just a few loose ends to tie up dougherty out
your briar patch turned out to be more hospitable than i expected
how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive
our best scientific minds already have we cannot find any other way to do this
then the songa can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do
how many people would it take before it becomes wrong a thousand fifty thousand a million
there's nothing further to be gained from this
is this how a federation officer begs for his life
i am not begging for my life i am begging for yours  there is still a way home gal'na
do you know how to disable the injector
but i would need at least three minutes on the bridge
if we could lure him away from the bridge
scan for lifesigns
no sir but it was not easy being among them
may i talk to you alone
deploy the collector
the shields in that section will not protect them against the thermolytic reaction
thankyou for reminding me
are they
do you have everything you need from command
when i was an ensign i could detect a threemicron mis alignment
do you know how they were damaged
by a songa weapon  there's no doubt about it sir that is what made data malfunction
the songa reports claim they did not fire until after he malfunctioned
i do not believe it happened that way
why would they fire at him without provocation
all i know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot then his failsafe system was activated
so you are saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong
it is nothing i am just tired
i think it is the universal greeting when you do not like someone
the manifold cannot handle full impulse in the patch commander
if we do not outrun them the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship
i will be in engineering
you got me commander
that is your expert opinion
negative i want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can
the purpose being
if it works you mean
why not
on screen
eject the core
commander if one of their weapons hits that gas
it is our only way out of here mister nara
how long until they reach us
eighteen minutes
cometary debris pockets of unstable metreon gas we do not want to go in there sir
yes we do  you are relieved ensign take over at ops
remind me to lodge a protest
we are through running from these bastards
blow out the ramscoop stand by full thrusters
we cannot delay the archaeological expedition to hanoran two it would put us into the middle of monsoon season
the diplomatic corps is busy with dominion negotiations
 so they need us to put out one more brush fire  anyone remember when we used to be explorers
deck ten
commander riker
we will not be able to go any faster than onethird impulse in that muck
nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey
so where are the 'environmental concerns' the admiral was talking about
the only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region
we are not going anywhere
you klingons never do anything small do you
aye sir
go back to your quarters  that is an order
top level review my ass there will be no coverup of this not after i get
jeanluc picard my officers doctor crusher and counselor troi
would you like something to eat
no we are here to rescue them
as you wish but i would ask you to disarm yourselves this village is a sanctuary of life
actually i was a good deal older when we arrived in terms of my physical condition
ask them
i am afraid there's too much bitterness on both sides
slow to impulse we are on our way
we will skip the court martial this time picard out
yes yes i can hear you
we are trying to get to you sir
we are coming as fast as we can we cannot risk using phasers
i understand tell doctor crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready
transmit a wide band covariant signal that will get his attention
he might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach
the metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux steer clear of them mister worf
beam him out
prepare to enter the atmosphere we will use the ionospheric boundary to shake him
evasive maneuvers heading one fourzero mark threeone
no sir i have not had a chance to meet all the new crew members since i have been back
i am not letting go of him
transferring controls to manual
no sir
debrief them again  have you been in a fight commander
no sir it is a gorch
picard to crusher
no we will be responsible for that mister worf
accelerated hair growth is often experienced by klingons during jak'tahla
we have to find shelter
decloak the holoship and engage a tractor beam mister worf
can you beam him off
negative he is established a security field around the control room
is there any other way to disable the injector
say the greeting again
yewcheen cheffaw emphasis on the 'cheeng and the 'faw'
better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette something that goes well with chrysanthemums
environmental concerns again an android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind
what are they interested in
wine women and song
you should feel right at home with them
hmm i should feel right at home with them
you are in luck it says here they have taken women from several races as indentured servants
good question
was i doing something to your neck
no children
if that is true they are a dying race
got a minute i need a little counseling  first time for everything do i lie down or what
whatever makes you comfortable
but it is comfortable
why do not you try sitting up
or you could try lying down
you are in quite a mood today
 i believe you
 i am not sleeping well
 doctor crusher has something that will take care of that
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up
activating injector assembly
sir i am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels
your scanners must be malfunctioning
all ship functions are offline
they must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here
isolate one and reroute its command sequence through the auxiliary processor
mister data set a pursuit course maximum warp
i look forward to reading your report
montana well that answers everything why the hell are we 
we are here to find zephram cochrane he may be injured or dead
cochrane the inventor of warp drive
jeanluc this man needs medical attention now
as i recall the town of resurrection is about two kilometers east of here they might have a hospital
it may not be that simple this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history
are you saying they will not help us
let's hope so because if cochrane dies the future may die with him
yes but until then you will have to make do with what you have got
that will be interesting
i will be fine  he is a different story
it was an experience metal scalpels needle and thread
you think they are still up there
if they are not we would better get used to living in montana
that might not be so bad at least for you
you want some advice do not do this again  you know exactly what i mean
beverly there were many reasons why you and i
at least four hours
um yeah  now he is going to need a respirator do you have one
we have two but we do not have the juice to run them
bag him
intelligence ambition desire i bring order to chaos
it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference
i do not know what you are referring to
that is because you have not been properly stimulated yet
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endoskeletal structure
what a cold description for such a beautiful gift
they are not your friends they have held you back kept you from your destiny
that is not true they have tried to help me
have they given you what i have given you did they even try
i do not want this
i wish to go back to the way i was
more lies
i am your creator now
a universe of sensation is waiting for you do not you want to explore it with me
no no please you cannot
yes but the enterprise my duty
 is to yourself do not make me hurt you again
and i need to control this ship let me into your mind
i believe so
do it
bring us about target borg ship alpha four port side battery
ready quantum torpedo
go to impulse where is the borg ship
it has entered earth orbit  correction  it is not in orbit it is heading directly toward the surface
where is the sphere
contact starfleet command
according to our astrometric readings the year is 2063
today is march second 2063 the time in montana is oheightforty five
i am the borg
that is a contradiction the borg act as a collective consciousness there are no individuals
i am the beginning the end i am the one who is many i am the borg
but how
not very well we met shortly after the enterprisee was commissioned i found her to be a most promising officer
i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming grief loss remorse
i will admit there are times when i wish i had an emotion chip i could turn on and off
doctor crusher has been studying some advanced medical theories
i told you there's no 
oh just a little tinkering how is he
let's go
how serious is the damage
i am having trouble scanning underground there's a lot of radiation leaking from something
probably from the nuclear warhead cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive
there should be an access hatch nearby
i have the password right here
there should be some kind of manual release
it could be the radiation captain try from the surface
yeah if i knew what it looked like there's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this
we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours  there must be some design schematics blueprints
always am
phoenix to control  initiating five minute countdown mark
tell her to go back to resurrection
she is a very determined woman  phoenix to control mister lange let her in
then we will just have to assume it is still there
that is still there
get a tricorder you are going to have to track my exact position in that room
altitude fifty kilometers
entering the upper ionospere
there's a red light on the second intake valve
ignore it we will be fine  prepare for first stage shutdown and separation on my mark
as they used to say all systems are go
the nacelles are charged nuclear warhead standing by we are ready to ignite the warp drive
i am on it
speed  two hundred seventyfive thousand kilometers per second
one minute to warp threshold
picard to enterprise  picard to enterprise  do you read me
well i feel a whole lot better with them out there we may need some help
we are crossing the threshold
it will be tight but we should make it
what about our warp signature it has to be strong enough for them to detect
i have enhanced the plasma injectors  do not worry they will see it
well with any luck the vulcans will land outside resurrection tomorrow morning and earth will never be the same again
lieutenant actually lieutenant jonathan scrimm i am the head of the resurrection protective force  and you are
jeanluc picard
great name french
oh here and there you know how it is
not really i was born and raised right here never had much use for travel
california san francisco
beautiful city used to be anyway i did not think anyone still lived there
there's a few of us left
it was not a trick i used to be an electrical engineer
i am an old friend of cochrane's i wanted to see how he was doing
lucky for him you came by when you did he might be dead now
something wrong with that
not yet
the invasion plans
wrong answer mister picard try again
and you know all this because uyou areu a spaceman too
i am afraid you have caught me i am a spaceman
yes he is
ah yes but i did not realize that 
thank god this plate was already fixed
i can try
trade okay the photographs for a straight answer  who are you and how do you know zephram
i am an old friend i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in 
'fraid not
what makes you say that
you are not someone who lies very easily so it is obvious when you do at least to me
are you always sucha good judge of character
no not like you and doctor crusher used to be
how did you know about that
i am sure it is but it will have to wait until tomorrow
it cannot wait until tomorrow
too bad  besides it will give you all night to think up a new set of lies
do not flatter yourself i take pictures of a lot of junk
friends from cornell
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon
i have to
where and do not tell me san francisco
no it is a lot further than that
it is the future is not it just like you told scrimm  i knew you were not from around here
no i am from france
i do not care if you are from france or venus just take me with you
that is impossible
aye sir
on screen
population thirtyfive billion  all borg
western hemisphere north american continent
aye sir
data set a course for that vortex
steady as she goes
intercept course full impulse  weapons status
phasers are offline we have two quantum torpedoes left but the computer targeting system has been destroyed
go to manual
aye sir
worf torpedo now
they did it they assimilated earth
on screen
life signs
cannot tell longrange bio sensors are offline
i will keep in contact you have the bridge
yes sir
then make it so have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex
unless you would like to stay
no sir
incoming message from the starship intrepid admiral hayes
it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room
we will have to assume they have been assimilated into the collective
they appear to be modifying the deflector dish
computer  thermal enhancement
they are converting the deflector dish into an antennae
agreed options
destroy the deflector dish
the borg will undoubtedly attack set phasers to rotating modulation
just a little queasy
try not to look at the stars keep your eyes on the ship
i will keep that in mind
emergency override
mister worf find data if you can but your top priority is isolating the borg
do we have any idea how many borg we are dealing with
where the hell are they going
deflector dish why the deflector dish
what are you suggesting
i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll
hold that thought
riker here
there's a dampening field in place on this deck our tricorders are useless
any sign of data or the borg themselves
something is very wrong commander we are falling back
commander we have a problem
there were no planetary defense systems in this era their weapons were designed to fight each other not extraterrestrials
data's positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise command codes security protocols
what kind of message
admiral donaldbill
mr president we cannot allow federation citizens to be abducted
at present i am awaiting a full report from enterprise pending that i am constrained to observe interstellar law
the longer we wait the less accessible the hostages will be mr president
i will bear it in mind admiral i think that is all
i am going too they may need a doctor
the charge is murder
you may need assistance doctor
vulcans sleep lying down
we do sleep lying down
thank you nurse jim she is ready lock and load
we were beginning to hit our stride together doctor
that is the question 
you heard the order lieutenant
i wish i knew uhura
can you  
jim i do not even know his anatomy
suppose he is holding a grudge
we are not finished
speak for yourself one day one night
bones are you afraid of the future
that was the general idea i intended to convey
i did not mean this future
are we playing multiple choice
some people are afraid of the future of what might happen  i was frightened really frightened
specifically of
uh uh somebody felt much worse and i am starting to understand why
well if you have got any bright ideas now's the time to 
still think we are finished
more than ever
do not remind me
no way  you see this
that cunning little vulcan
once we are beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away
if they are even looking for us
spock's looking for us
killed trying to escape  it is a classic
come on
and the good news is they are not going to prosecute
to be 
and perhaps with a large step or two like a peace treaty
starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of exploration
captain shall we attempt to return fire
in space no one can hear you sweat
if they did we would all have to turn ourselves in how can we rely on them
we were until your torpedoes
then let me help
aside from a touch of arthritis i would say pretty good
you say you are due for retirement may i ask do your hands shake
you were incompetent  whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine
they will make it look like an accident
what are you in for if you do not mind me asking
i do not mind smuggling guilty i come from arc smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there
that is a comfort
i am not sure how to take that
very much
i beg your pardon
you feign ignorance
what happened
how can i trust 
take them away
did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night
i checked the data banks yes
and what did they tell you
that we fired two photon torpedoes but 
those words were spoken by me
i have on occasion disobeyed orders
and you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of chancellor gorkon
well i 
you deny that your men beamed aboard kronos one and shot the chancellor
i cannot confirm or deny actions which i did not witness
so if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination  
your honors the state rests
captain sulu on assignment anyone seen spock
full diplomatic courtesy mr chekov
i know what you mean
uhura monitor
torpedo bay did we fire those torpedoes
who else
she is only a cog in the wheel  no way she knows that
but if she is cloaked
shields up battle stations
aye sir thrusters
aye sir thrusters
second star to the right  and straight on till morning
shields up captain 
you tell them lieutenant
they must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here
this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory
now we go to starfleet
now we expand our search to include uniforms
all uniforms
she programmed the torpedo hits
mr valtane any more data
do we report this sir
are you kidding  send to starfleet command
is that wise sir i mean given their situation   aye sir
chancellor we have been ordered to escort you through federation space to your meeting place on earth
thank you captain
we will make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours
i shall look forward to it
starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors
we must do this again soon
give a girl a chance captain
good enough for one  two would look suspicious killed while attempting escape now that is convincing for both
they will be here
i like it here
kill him he is the one
not me idiot  him
he is got it
and your coat
fraid not it would not fit him anyway
krandog aranty
there's a reward for your death
we did not kill gorkon
of course not anyway somebody up there wants you out of the way
do not you know everyone on rura penthe is here for life
anything else you want to tell me
there's gotta be a way out of this place
except us
it is possible
where do we come in
candidate for what
captain if 
stand down mr scott all stop that is an order
aye sir
who else
saavik sir we were told you would need a helmsman    so i volunteered
thank you lieutenant one quarter impulse power
captain may i remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock
plot a course for kronos lieutenant
kronos sir
i am still in the chair lieutenant
aye sir
we are almost at the rendezvous  i thought you would want to know
you piloted well out of spacedock lieutenant 
i always wanted to try that
only do not try putting words in my mouth
right standard rudder z plus five degrees
uhura signal our surrender
i will not allow starfleet to be dismantled over some klingon promises
you hear that
you understand that by even talking to us you are violating regulations captain
i am sorry captain  your message is breaking up
bless you sulu  where is the peace conference they are going to attempt another assassination
the conference is at camp khitomer near the romulan border i am sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency
according to my information today
thank you captain sulu
do not mention it captain kirk
you have personally 
there's an old vulcan proverb only nixon could go to china
how could you vouch for me that is   arrogant presumption 
i was asked by my father to open neg
do not trust them do not believe them 
they are dying
let them die
the chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal
far be it for me to dispute my first officer starfleet has always 
i am going to sleep it off let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight
i am uncertain
spock i am really tired
we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation
from enterprise
we have fired on the chancellor's ship 
according to the data bank we have  twice
so that is it
what peace conference
why would they give them to us
the commander is an old friend of yours
you were right it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation you might have died
i too was blind i knew about her  and i did nothing i trusted too much
gorkon had to die before i understood how prejudiced i was
not for the actions of another no one is responsible for any actions but his own human beings 
but i am not human i am only 
spock you want to know something
not yet section 4236
probably trying to figure out why we are reversing wondering if we detect her
 is to trust him
control this is enterprise requesting permission to depart
this is the starship enterprise captain james kirk commanding
this is enterprise we surrender repeat  enterprise surrenders 
i am going aboard spock you have the conn
who else
not from a distance she will not show up on any type of scan
such things have happened before sir
not as yet sir
curious you have not been assisting commander uhura with her radio transmissions have you lt
commander uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir
very well for twentyfour hours we will agree that this conversation did not take place
a lie
an omission after that 
an error
i do not want to
i believe you please
you cannot prove any of this
confirmed captain
signal starfleet that we have no idea location of enterprise
no sir
fiftyfour planets  and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies our sensing and analytic equipment worked well
then it is time we were heading home three years is
what is it
 i cannot confirm the existence of praxis
i have already addressed that question mr scott we will e able to follow the captaings movements
mr scott you forget yourself please accompany me
yet the data banks insist we fired twice one computer is lying
a computer canna lie sir
i think  not
you can check the torpedoes visually if you like 
we will have to check every one of them mr scott
that could take hours
then someone forged a data bank entry
i know precisely where he will be
there was an enormous neutron energy surge
not from us
if another ship had been beneath us the klingons would have seen her
would they
this one can
they you are talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction mr spock
i believe i am
aye aye sir
how do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice
he is placing himself in a most awkward position
what exactly does that mean
it means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did
even assuming you are correct mr spock why would they fire on their own president
mr scott any progress on repairing our warp drive
maybe we should write them a letter
but you did not join a conspiracy
um he was older
besides that
to be honest when i am working i do not look at faces much he knew the guy's name
of course he knows everything about dick low
takes four days to chill then its time to come back  is that
i am babysitting the dea guys this afternoon casio and i you said that was top priority
just mopping up nine bodies in all
anybody talk to the press
no sir
the diner
fella's name is harold speck traveling man out of roswell
excuse me a salesman gets done in his car and you call the fbi
ten miles back on the texas side
i would appreciate it if you kept this to yourself
i know how the feds like to sit on information i got something in the car to show you
you are thinking
who knows
this is not in our database
mack this is sheriff dylan
you tell me
sheriff dylan this is fbi agent thomas mackelway remember me
hi there
i want to talk about the karen sumpter case
you heard
she is buried
i want the autopsy report where is it minnesota
the body was embalmed i do not understand 
turn the body over there was something in the autopsy report yes here  these burn marks
a grill pattern
we need to run this through vicap search for similar burns
we had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this
this is agent mackelway
not a discrepancy an error my capacity is 55 tons not 6
i have 6 tons
mam it is my truck i know my own capacity
you cannot imagine how many men have told me that
it is been customized for sleeping capacity
oh yes i see you must get asked this a lot
not as much as you would think
sorry i have seen you in here always lugging that case around  whatja sell
ah restaurant supplies i did not get your name
you must travel a lot huh
i do not mean to be rude but
just getting a jolt of java before heading on home  how does your wife feel about it
excuse me
you know you ever think about other women
fucking i am talking about fucking harold you ever think of fucking other women
take a look harold tell me if you see anything you want you do like to look do not you
not bad huh
you are a you are sick
that is wrong with me
you are going to miss it pay attention
what do you want from me
why me what do you want from me
i did not wait on him fifty or so white regular build needed a shave  that is all i remember
how did you know he was a construction worker
he had an orange hat on
it is been wiped down a hundred times since then
what kind
nada vague description that is all finetoothcombed speck's car the diner no fingerprints no trace evidence
that is with the eyelids
at the field office
let's take a look at it  drop off my stuff at the hotel after you are done here
maybe something to do with zorro
just an observer
smarter than us
another what
serial killer killed in ft myers cut up in his van and this time we got a witness
what are you doing
from the grave
they do not know how to crack these secret chat rooms 
the federal bureau of investigation is not based on personal preference we share information
then why do i still have a badge
pretty embarrassed to be honest i had him
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard
he got away i had him he got away
do you think he singled you out
no just coincidence he knew who i was of course he had my id  did he keep it
go ahead
if my reporting agent could be someone outside computer crimes perhaps agent kulok
what i do requires confidentiality
had trouble sleeping last night sir
okay harold speck who goes first
i do not believe this
i am hesitant to
mack the mouth at a loss for words
i suspected but you were the one low contacted that is why i brought you back here
what did you think of the suspect zero theory
we need to put out an ncic inquiry
how do you send out an apb on a dead man
huh sir
i was visiting an old college friend
you did not tell anyone where you were
that breaks my confidentiality stipulation
i did not use low's name
there was talk of a file photo
in ft myers before your instruction nowhere else sir
as far as the public knows richard low is dead and he will stay dead until we kill him
i need to get to amarillo immediately
have you told richard low about amarillo
i cannot the chat room is not open for another five days
we will wait get online with low inform him of zero's route  we will set a trap for him
what about zero darryl hawkins
hawkins is not the target richard low's the target
there's a killer out there  we know who he is he could be stalking now
dick low's a killer too
thank you rangers  put this man in the unmarked
you better hope the director does not stop abruptly one day david you might break your nose
you are a disgrace to law enforcement to the bureau  and to me
suspect zero now there's an idea that does not look good on paper 
they sort of got me on shit detail no offense
none taken
the academy then ciiac
five months i love it
not especially
why did he come out here that is going on
beats me he just asked me to come along doublecheck the forensics  what did you do to piss him off
that informationgs being withheld from the media
a very sexy case
where is my watch it is gone
it explains a lot
the man knew how to dress
do not even go there that is up
the other reason
you want to have dinner
chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims i went live last month
this is some serious shit
people end up in occupations for a reason they may think not but they do occupations define us
and one other thing
that is that
grown man dressed like a clown does he really think he looks good
he thinks he looks young
that is this country coming to
none cannot find a thing nothing on file nothing online it is not a part of any known killer's signature
i was thinking maybe we should ask professor daitz nobody knows this stuff better
do not be too harsh
no mack i do not think you are a square and definitely not a nerd
because you asked him to stupid
oh yeah i forgot
intraagency fraternizing
it is a nono
i know
i have been thinking about this
does koessler ask about me
he is called a couple times
what did you tell him
just routine stuff
not about coming to see daitz
not yet not about this either
we did find these however
sue ann hanson
you mean 
not yet this time they are waiting for you
i cannot they trust me they accept me i have got their confidence
no i mean maybe we should back off a bit you and me
then there's the other issue
that is that
you need time to think about the case about you and me
i found a peephole into deviant world i am gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out
and nobody else can do that
not the way i can
i just need to go a little slow
where are you everybody's looking for you
that is up
i am in omaha get to the airport there's been another one
you want to get him find something he wants get him to come to you
start killing people for real
suspect zero
that is a crackpot theory everybody says so
i guess i am a little paranoid
that is going on
you were right he found me
and you are working with him
probably i told him koessler had ordered the report kept it secret
koessler does not know any of this
they say richard low is wrong but because of him women innocent women are alive who would be dead
you are putting me in a difficult position
hardly anyone calls me tom everybody calls me mack i always liked that
you okay
yeah of course
that is going on
low calls him suspect zero
suspect zero is a crackpot theory you said so
that is what koessler wants us to believe to discredit low
i am going to amarillo
sit back
of course he does now get the key get these things off me  unhook me
i want to protect the boy i also want to protect suspect zero  from you
no weapon
turn around stretch your arms over the seat
i will be back
the little piggie speaks
i will give you a little hint you are a smart guy figure it out
when you exit head east on 10th
i believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops
how is the arm
i have been reading hearing about you i spoke to koessler professor daitz
he could not break an egg with a hammer he still writing those crime porn books
he is moved on to tv
you are a smart guy tell me what it says
agent low's theory of suspect zero the undetected serial killer is delusional the product of good intentions paranoia and obsession
and who else did i find agent thomas mackelway crackerjack fbi techie i was greatly disappointed when you were reassigned
you knew it was me all along
i know you lionheart i watched your mind work heard your dirty thoughts 
those were just fantasies
yeah problem was i had the only copy see ya
lionheart here i am back sorry about the absence i had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel
whatever happened to mydick
something came up murman my man
lead the way murman

i talked to him
350 miles
now mr hawkins when last in amarillo where did you get gas
excuse me agent mackelway
this man hawkins has killed dozens of people suspect zero
what is it exactly i do not understand agent mackelway
deputy director koessler does not want zero all he cares about is low
perhaps you can explain it to him  it is agent mackelway
take your shirt off
i know i know
you have been through worse
you are right i know
ever since i have known you
i do not know about that
moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this
it did not feel that way
you really should life after all is really just a series of challenges
enough i have got to use the phone

no thanks why ruin a perfect night
i am a comedian
uh i do not want to bet it all
sure that will be fine
well i am afraid it is not that easy
why not
there are different circuits it is hard to explain you would not understand
who's your booking agent
oh you know about booking agents i do not uh actually have a west coast agent as of yet
well who represents you back east
actually it is funny you i am actually uh between
what do you do trent
already you poor thing it will not last
why not
it is a rebound
we were a rebound and we lasted six years
yeah but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from
six years
sure i guess the phone's in the back
i understand
well you can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you
listen i had a great time
me too
i would love to see you again sometime
i will be around
that is not good enough i want to make plans to see you
let me get a pen out of my car  do you have something to write on
yeah and an actor
i will have to come see you sometime
if and when i get a real gig i will call you
it is not going to well
yeah but entertainment law is not something you just jump into
neither is acting not if you are serious about it  can i have one of these
why you like the duck with the cigar 
yeah nice touch it is the logo from you bet your life right
good eye not one club owner got it they all ask me why i got donald duck on my card

no no hold on
you did not have to get off the other line i would have called you back
that is okay i wanted to talk to you
six months
how are you doing
fine i guess you
good  i think about things
you know us
i thought you met someone else
it does not matter i think about you every day
why did not you call
yeah with the baby in the tire one time i started to cry right in front of pierre
pierre that is his name pierre is he french
you do not call
but you said i should not call if i wanted to give up on her
it sucks
right wait what do you mean
i mean first you will pretend not to care not call  whatever and then eventually you really will not care
unless she comes back first
ah see that is the thing somehow they do not come back until you really do not care anymore
there's the rub
there's the rub
thanks man sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time
hey man do not sweat it
it is just that you have been there your advice really helps
no problem
rob i just want you to know you are the only one i can talk to about her
thanks thanks man
it is a gig
i mean i need the money
you are an actor find the zen in the role
it is definitely a step back for me
look there's not much of a call for shakespeare in this town
i did not want to say anything
what like you did not want to jinx it
oh no

i have been around here six months and i still cannot get over it
i cannot wait till i actually get to touch one of them

how would you happen to come here
oh someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago
i suspected as much
you need not worry it is over and done with a long time ago
annie  there's nothing between mitch and me
is not there  maybe there is not maybe there's never anything between mitch and any girl
what do you mean
four years ago of course that was shortly after his father died  things may be different now
a trifle
because she was afraid
afraid you would take mitch
afraid i would give mitch
i do not understand
afraid of any woman who would give mitch the only thing lydia can give him  love
annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman
she already has a daughter
what about mitch did not he have anything to say about this
you get straight to the point do not you
i am sorry forgive me
i will be going too to help out it should be fun melanie
it seems so pointless  i think i will go to sleep this has been a busy day  my luggage
that is up to you
it is really up to lydia is not it
never mind lydia do you want to go
it is what you said mom mr brinkmeyer's feed is no good
no cathy he sold mr fawcett a different brand  you do not think they are getting sick do you mitch
just listen to them
they are birds

your brother told me
oh i suppose so

i do not think your mother would like that
just a little one

the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range in fact during our christmas count we recorded
birds are not bad
what happened
young woman cut herself
shall i call the doctor
i do not think it is that serious you want to sit up here
stop worrying deke she was in a boat
i do not think miss daniels is going to sue anybody
well you are the lawyer 
we will make our own fog
let me have some apple pie helen  who said anything about war all i said was that some gulls
one apple pie you want more coffee
no came down on one of my boats they could have been after the fish just as you said

i had to acknowledge a delivery  mother i would like you to meet
a what
melanie daniels melanie my mother
a delivery mother miss daniels brought some birds from san francisco

yes lovebirds we could not let you
lovebirds i see
i will pick you up miss daniels where are you staying
i do not know what good that will do  chickens will not eat
caviat emptor mother let the buyer beware
whose side are you on
i am simply quoting the law
never mind the law cathy you can start serving the soup
yes very
and certainly pretty
i told you we met yesterday
in a bird shop
no i only led her into believing i believed she was mother it is really very complicated
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
mother where did you go to law school
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer is not she
yes mother
it is none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to
well  so long as you know what you want mitch
i know exactly what i want mother
i think he got a little scratch mother
that is right we had a party here this afternoon for cathy her birthday
i got them all mother
when do you think they will come
i do not know
if there are larger birds mitch they will get into the house
that is a chance we have to take
maybe we ought to leave
not now  not while they are massing out there
where will we go
i do not know yet  i think we will be safe here  let's bring that wood in
what happens when we run out of wood
you do not know you do not know when will you know when we are all dead like annie
i am sorry mitch
oh my god look at her
get a rope
i know you can  but i would like to
you are doing fine
i mean i want to
but they will be back
we will not be here
where can we go mitch there's no place to go
i want to try for san francisco there are buildings there steel and concrete
we would never make it they are probably all over the road
we have to try it  we cannot stay here  melanie needs help  mother the house will not take another attack
if  if when we get to san francisco  if they are already there
they will not be
if they are
we will worry about that when we get there
i am frightened terribly frightened i i do not know that is out there mitch
you do not have to
no not exactly
yeah and the freeway's welllighted is not it mitch
oh thank you
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm
why did not al believe my story
he was calling from the farm mrs brenner
then he saw
he must have he sent for the santa rosa police
what good will they do
do i sound foolish to you
i wish i were a stronger person there is a long awkward silence she sips at her tea reflectively
yes i think so my son is important to me i want to like any girl he chooses
and if you do not
then i do not suppose it will matter much to anyone but me
i think it might also matter to mitch
i could not ask you to
i do not mind really
would you i would feel so much better
i will just clear up here and then dress
did you close the door
and locked it
shhhh shhhh
we know what it is al
not by the thousands
no i gotta admit this is peculiar  did you have a light burning or something
yes but the curtains were drawn
'cause sometimes birds are attracted by light you know  sure is a peculiar thing
what are we going to do about it al
i do not think i get you mitch do about what
well  well these birds attacked us
did not know how he got in there had a broken leg turned out just fluttering all around there 
these birds were
thanks al we will be all right
goodnight lydia
now hold it mitch you do not know that for a fact
we will use smoke pots like the army uses
that is all right
well i
bodega bay he goes up there every weekend
bodega bay where is that
up on the coast about sixty miles north of here
sixty  oh
about an hour and a half on the freeway or two if you take the coast highway
yes yes someone's got to feed them
i am awfully sorry
yes i understand there are different varieties it that true
well yes sir there are
as the same time i would not want birds that were aloof either
no of course not
do you have a pair that are just friendly
i think so sir  now then let me see
are not these lovebirds
no sir those are redbirds
the sign says strawberry finches
yes we call them that too  ahhh here we are lovebirds 
those are canaries miss  does not this make you feel awful
does not what make me
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this
well we cannot just let them fly around the shop you know
i suppose not is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages
oh certainly it is to protect the species
i imagine that is very important especially during the moulting season
yes that is a particularly dangerous time
are they moulting now
some of them are
how can you tell
well they get a sort of hangdog expression
are you sure you would not like to see a canary instead we have some very nice canaries this week
all right  she smiles back
i was merely drawing a parallel miss daniels
but how how do you know my name
a little birdie told me  good day miss daniels  madam 
hey wait a minute
ahhh but i know you
we never met in court or anyplace else
that is true i will rephrase it i saw you in court
i did not break that window
no but your little prank did the judge should have put you behind bars
what are you a policeman
i simply believe in the law miss daniels and i am not too keen on practical jokers
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical
ahhh but i really do want those birds
you knew i did not work here you deliberately
i am  good day  madam 
and i am glad you did not get your lovebirds
i will find something else  see you in court some day
what made it
it deliberately came down at you  you are bleeding
just some peroxide i want to clean out the cut
that is right what are you doing in bodega bay
do you practice here
no san francisco what are you
what kind of law
not everyone miss daniels
only violators and practical jokers
did not you see the lovebirds
you came all the way up here to bring me those birds
to bring your sister those birds you said it was her birthday besides i was coming up anyway
what for
to see a friend of mine  will you please be careful
i am sorry  who's your friend
well well small world annie hayworth
we we went to school together college
did you imagine that how long will you be staying
just a few just a day or two the weekend
i think we will have to shave the hair deke have you got a razor
oh no you do not
it is still bleeding a little here let me put this on
why would i want to see you of all people
none of your business  am i still bleeding
i cannot say i like your seagulls much either i come all the way up here to
but you were coming up anyway remember
i was and all i get for my pains is a a a hole in the head
right next to the one you already had
look mr brenner
i am sorry i could not possibly
you are are not you
certainly but
then it is settled what time is dinner mother
of course how stupid of me a quarter to seven will that be all right
annie annie may have made other plans i will have to see besides i can find my own way
you are sure now you will not hire a boat or anything
i am sure
seven o'clock then
he was watching a ball game on television
oh yes
will i be seeing you again
san francisco's a long way from here
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns
oh that rome
mmmm i like to swim we might get along very
in case you are interested i was pushed into that fountain
without any clothes on
i am neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd
yes but
who did not much care for propriety or convention or
yes that is the truth but i was pushed into that fountain and that is the truth too
sure do you really know annie hayworth
no  at least i did not until i came up here
so you did not go to school together
yes i was lying
did you really write a letter to me or was that a lie too
i wrote the letter
what did it say
like jumping into a fountain in rome
i told you what happened in rome
do you expect me to believe
i do not give a damn what you believe
it is for me
but not for me
what do you want 
i thought you knew i want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked good night
why do you have to rush off that is so important in san francisco
well i have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing
you have a job
i have several jobs
what do you do
i do different things on different days
like what
on mondays and wednesdays i work for the travelers' aid at the airport
helping travelers
nothing  i go to bird shops on fridays
i am glad you do
do you know what i was doing in that shop
you will think me very bold sir
no tell me
a gull smashed into annie's front door  mitch that is happening
i do not know melanie  look do you have to go back to annie's
no i have my things in the car
then stay and have something to eat before you start back i would feel a lot better
no thank you
i will get it
are you staying
i think i should do not you
it is an uprising
of birds
certainly of birds
yes of course he had to have a beard 'birds of the world unite' he kept saying over and over
so they united
not at first oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks
well they will go along with anything
sure but eventually even the more seriousminded birds began to listen why should humans rule they asked themselves
hear hear
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages birds of the world unite
take wing
you have nothing to lose but your feathers
it was like that yesterday
what do you mean
after the gulls attacked
i had not thought of that  and then the swifts came
it makes you feel as if they are they are waiting or resting or
no they are having a meeting melanie your sparrow is standing on a soap box and
i am frightened mitch
no no
at annie's house she is all right
do not let's take any chances
we have got to get cathy
the bay does not
how long have they been gathering there
it it does not look very different does it a little smoke over the town but otherwise
even the birds sitting out there it does look very much the same mitch this could be last week
it may not be last week again for a long long time
i tried a little while ago the phone's dead
have we still got power
yes  i am tired mitch i am so very very tired
i thought they would have stopped by now
what time is it
almost two am
you must be exhausted
how about you
i do not want to be safe i want to be with you
no wait  hold me
we will take it slow until we get to the main road  are you ready
i i do not think so if we get through town i think we will be all right
hello miss daniels
what do you suppose it is
you said three o'clock
certainly not oh no certainly not this will be a full grown myna bird full grown
and he will talk
well yes he will talk well no no you will have to teach him to talk
oh oh well all right
well all right but
oh good oh wonderful
i have no idea
what oh yes certainly
no you would better send him may i use your phone
yes certainly 
do you have any lovebirds
no not in the shop but i can order them for you
how soon
well well how soon would you want them
immediately  is this the daily news melanie daniels would you get me the city desk please
i might be able to have them by tomorrow morning would that be all right
thank you  do you know dan fawcett's number
birds are not aggressive creatures miss they bring beauty to the world it is mankind rather who
insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet if it were not for birds
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world
these were not a few birds
what were the crows after at the school
what do you think they were after miss
daniels i think they were after the children
for what purpose
to  to kill them
i thought not birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx miss daniels a hundred and twenty million years ago
no one called it a war
are you discussing gamebirds now all birds are not gamebirds you know
i do not know anything about birds except that they are attacking this town
maybe is it impossible
no one ever said you were mitch
do you believe it is true sebastian
no i do not mitch because i cannot see any reason for it
it is happening is not that a good enough reason
i like bodega bay as well as any man if i thought 
then help me sebastian you are an important man in this town if you will help the rest will
help how what do you want to do
i am not sure but
if you do not even know what you want to do
with smoke
can we go on living here otherwise
you and mr sholes seem to be implying as much
we need them
not if they are starting a war
they are incapable of organized warfare
that would hardly be possible
probably contain more than a hundred billion birds
which gulls mr sholes there are several varieties
the ones that have been raising the devil with my fishing boats
probably herring gulls they arrive in november you know and do not migrate north again until march or
of course
makes a lot more sense than well an attack
then let's go now
i have not finished my drink
put on your coats do you want to get trapped here
take it easy lady  there is not a bird anywhere in sight
cannot you please finish your drink
all right all right  hope you figure this out folks
where are they
can i get you something a glass of water a transfusion
where are they last chance
or what you will bleed all over my carpet
i am looking for my friends
you sent them i had no choice
you are wrong
yeah  i see doubt oozing out your arm where do people go when they kill their girlfriends
we will not
dream on
down wait do not tell me
the cops from my trial they killed lauren the whole thing was fixed 
i am thinking that explains a lot
i was hoping you would find out
yeah i sure will
i believe they call it a connoisseur's club owned by delt
i think we should get some support
what call the police
i guess it is true guns do not kill people

about you
about them you have got to leave it alone
i do not believe you
please come inside
i am never going back in that house again get away
thanks  i am enjoying it right here
the whole city has stopped people are running around like ants
what a brilliant idea i never would have thought of it
i talked to most of them this morning they were all very curious about the meeting
good did you speak to our friend mr carpenter
he will be there at 830
tell me hilda  does all this frighten you  does it make you feel insecure
yes sir  it certainly does
that is good hilda i am glad
almost negligible with variation of parameters this is the answer
how can you be so sure have you tested this theory
that was my first question
you would have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting
no  not at all
what about your personal safety in the meantime what about the army  and the police
my name is carpenter and i am a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house
i am afraid i cannot offer you any real protection i have no influence in cases of interplanetary conspiracy
i am sure i will be quite safe until the meeting
one thing mr klaatu suppose this group should reject your proposals what is the alternative
i am afraid you have no alternative in such a case the planet earth would have to be  eliminated
i assure you such power exists
yes  of course
i would not want you to harm anybody  or destroy anything
why do not you leave it to me i will think of something
maybe a little demonstration
i think we have all been hearing too much about space men
hello darling  good evening mr carpenter
boy we had a swell time did not we mr carpenter
mom  why does mr carpenter have to go down to the police station
i  i do not know dear perhaps there's some mistake
professor barnhardt
yeah sure mom do i have to go to school tomorrow
of course dear
aw gee mom  i had plans to play with mr carpenter
gee why mom he is my best friend and he is awful good in arithmetic he even helps professor barnhardt
did you and mr carpenter really go to see professor barnhardt
what do you mean dear
i mean  on account of that policeman last night  you think he is a bank robber maybe or a gangster
i could not go to sleep mom i had to tell you
tell me what
no i have not mom i promise you i saw it
you did not really see the space ship you just thought you did
well not exactly i gave him two dollars
come on darling  we are going up to bed
yes dear come on now  bobby your shoes are soaking
yeah  the grass was kind of wet
no  i am afraid not
gee  i do not know the space man i guess
i was speaking of earth men i meant the greatest philosopher  the greatest thinker
he lives here in washington does not he
sure right near where my mother works
where is that
i should not be at all surprised
well  atomic power i would imagine
i thought that was only for bombs
no it is for a lot of other things too
you think it can go faster than an f 36
yes  i think so
gee how could they make a landing
well  there are several ways to reduce landing speed you see the velocity
i do not know bobby i am inclined to doubt it
mr carpenter  what does velocity mean
velocity is the time rate of change of position
you are just kidding are not you
would not you like to meet him
well sure i would but   aw i will bet you would be scared
we can scare him more than he can scare us
it is a problem in celestial mechanics
bet he is the only one in the world knows the answer
he does not know the answer and he will never get it that way
sure did not you ever hear of arlington cemetery
no  i am afraid not
mr carpenter  you do not seem to know about anything
i will tell you bobby  i have been away for a long time very far away
is it different where you have been  do not they have places like this
they have cemeteries but not like this one you see they do not have any wars
all right
no fooling will you
certainly  tell me bobby  do you have to have money to go there
no  i want to take you to the movies  do you think they would accept these
some places that is what people use for money they are easy to carry  and they do not wear out
bet they are worth about a million dollars
would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them
well sure but
why not bobby
she does not like me to steal from people
mr brady's a cop
we went to the movies  and we had ice cream cones  and we went to see daddy
we will finish it tomorrow goodnight bobby
thanks mr carpenter
i will say goodnight again
yeah  sure  it is a real boy scout flashlight
why  the light in my room went out  thank you bobby goodnight
he told me this morning when i examined him he is seventyeight
i do not believe it
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty
how does he explain that
the president asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened we all feel
sit down mr harley
you must have come a long way
about 250 million of your miles
from another planet let's just say that we are neighbors
i am afraid in the present situation you will have to learn to think that way
the present situation
i mean the reasons for my coming here
we are very curious about that too would you care to talk about it
i would be glad to  not now of course  with you alone
perhaps you would rather discuss it personally with the president
this is not a personal matter mr harley it concerns all the people on your planet
i  i am not sure i understand
i want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the earth
you know about the united nations
the first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle
i intend to explain to all the nations  simultaneously  how do we proceed mr harley
believe me you do not understand they would not sit down at the same table
i have been dealing in earth's politics a good deal longer than you have  goodnight sir
thank you have you any news
now that you understand the situation more clearly perhaps you would like to discuss the matter with the president
i can judge only by what i see
your impatience is quite understandable
i am impatient with stupidity my people have learned to live without it
i am afraid my people have not  i am very sorry  i wish it were otherwise
there's always somebody here but today of course they have all got plans
you still have not answered my question
you know how i feel tom i just want to think it over
the boss is leaving for chicago tomorrow if i could tell him i was getting married  with two dependents
you are a good salesman  but i have got to think about it
a good insurance salesman would not give you time to think
i will be in just a minute
the picture starts at eightfifty
i was talking to mr carpenter
i hope mr carpenter will not think i am intruding
is it real
looks real to me
bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight
you think it is all right for you to stay here
i have got a good lock on my door  and bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight
come on in
what about him
how do you know
never mind about that  you have got to promise me you will not say a word to anybody
are you crazy after what happened today
you do not understand you do not realize how important it is
important of course it is important the point is we can do something about it
but he is not a menace he told me what he came here for
why not somebody's got to get rid of him
i feel different right now
you wait and see you are going to marry a big hero
i am not going to marry anybody
i enjoyed every minute of it
jittery is the word
he has his homework to keep him occupied
he is a fine boy mrs benson
naturally i think so
goodnight mr carpenter
goodnight my dear
may i see you for a minute
i  i was just going to lunch
may i walk out with you
i  i did not really pay much attention  bobby has such an active imagination
did you believe what he told you  i have a reason for asking this  a very important reason
before i ask you to be honest with me perhaps i should be completely honest with you
what time is it
we will be stuck here for a little while  about thirty minutes
we could try pushing the other buttons  i have a flashlight in my purse
it will not work
you see  the electricity's been neutralized  all over the world
yes  just exactly
where is the meeting going to be
at the ship
i am worried about gort i am afraid of what he might do  if anything should happen to me
gort  but he is a robot i mean  without you what could he do
remember those words
i was
you mean he has the power of life and death
no  that is a power reserved to the almighty spirit
how long will i live  that no one can say
he will have you  and tom
no that is all finished
i am sorry
he will catch on to it in no time now
how did you get in here and what do you want
we came to see professor barnhardt
i have never seen such a stone will you please tell me where it came from
that is what i wanted you to tell me
there are no diamonds like this  any place in the world
would you like to sell it
no  no thanks
i would give you a very good price
i was only trying to be helpful he was having difficulty with a problem
that is right
i suppose you know that barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the army
in this case the secret would not be worth much he does not know the answer himself
but i suppose you know the answer
it is really quite simple the three body problem you know
no  i am afraid not
well how do i know who you are
you do not
they would have killed this man
get going will you brady  before i get mad
this one could save your life
it is a pretty cool place if you are a martian
this is not a comic book store right  it is a bakery

and everyone looks like us
exactly like you  well maybe not as healthy
i am so sorry kalen
what else can they do
kalen do you have any idea where they take them
we are not supposed to think about it  but i dream about it sometimes
what kind of stories
about the voice in the darkness about the ghosts
what happened
he came back screaming he never talked about it after that  i do not think he even got this far
this is it
around here
but there's nothing here
how did you know
what are you
i am the librarian  i have always been the librarian
i know you  you are an automaton of some sort that 
i am called vox   now you are eloi
who does not know the morlocks
do you know where they live
i was lucky  the others were not
how have you survived so long
can you show us where they live
excuse me
you will live like this forever alone  you were meant to help  to be with people  not like this
i am used to that
last night
send him away
kalen hold on a minute
it frightens you
oh shut up
this is the way in
yes are you sure you want to do this
yes  but you have done enough thank you for your help i hope someday people read your books again

the air the power
why did they built it
the morlocks did not build this
trust me you do not want to see any more
what can i do  tell me what to do
go back to the light  you were not made for this  i was i was made for this moment
i do not understand
i am going to end it alexander  as we discussed
i will never forget this
i should hope not   alexander make them read my books  tell them who they are who they could be
i will
you came underground when the world was ending above  and you evolved some into the morlocks and others 
no we created the morlocks
as slaves
we make them see what we wish
they survived above  became what they are
no they did not survive only to be your food  you did that
why would you let me go back
because the past is immutable frozen  dead and you are the past
so you take their best
a man can change his history

not here alone  please
no let's walk through the city
all right
nothing  let's just get out of the park
i want to get into the light that is all  please
alex it is just the zoo
no i am fine  i am   wonderful  just walking down the street with you again
we took a walk three days ago
the sailor's omen of good fortune the hunter watching over him on his travels
so it is astronomy now is it
i have seen it
it is only a machine
let them
i have something for you
do you know you were humming
i was not
somewhere around d2xy something something
damned if i can keep her out of my equations
tonight's the night
god and i am running late 
where is the challenge in that
alex this is your first year as an associate professor  you might want to play things a little more conservatively
you sound like my father
i do not  i want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see
how romantic
do you have a romantic bone in your body
no i am all bowler hat remember
it hurt me alex  very much
then why are you here
that is because i am working  you remember that  you used to care about your work
i care more about my life  and yours
i know that 
that is where you are wrong  i will change it
you would not believe me
i would
i will tell you what come by for dinner in a week and i will show you
why do not you come to our house instead
i cannot do that 
whengs the last time you were outside this house    or this room
i cannot leave when i am so close
you are dying here  do not you see that
i pray to god that in a week you are not here
in a week we will never have had this conversation
good night alex
i am glad
his home
i do not understand
all right all right  here  everything 
well it seems like a long time  but it was not really  it is rather hard to explain
some  but i mean we are not all so handsome
he is gone to a better place
what makes you say that
then you can speak slowly
i know it is hard to believe but it is true
that machine 
allowed me to travel from my time to yours
how long ago
more than 800000 years
why would you do that
just a dream  you should sleep too  you are still not well
i will
thank you
you can see so many here
do not then have stars where you come from
not like this they do not seem so bright with all the city lights  i never really noticed them much
good night
all of you
every night
you share dreams  that is incredible
we share everything
thank you
and this is your work
i can see kalengs point
want to be a high climber now do you
that is it all for
i do not understand
i mean why do you do it  what purpose does it serve
it has no purpose  it is just beautiful does everything have a purpose where you come from
most things  we are very high on purpose
i am a planner  i help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like
how do you decide
you liked it there
oh very  learning commerce the arts  the whole place was buzzing all the time  night and day
did you have fires at night
oh it was   most of the time
it sounds like a wonderful place to live
looking back i suppose it was i did not quite realize it at the time but
you know this
you lost someone
yes after her death it was intolerable for me here the future had to be better
is it
if you only knew
it is undamaged
yes a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship shape
so you can use it now
yes i suppose so
go back to your own time
i could
kalen  we have to get kalen  
do you have it
hello mr philby
then if emma turns me down will you marry me
oh i am already swooning
ouch  all right wish me luck
tell him to go away 
may i get you some 
that will be all
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is applied mathematics and engineering am i correct
exactly correct sir
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum
well perhaps i have deviated the tiniest bit
might i ask why
because the assigned curriculum is boring
abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical durations  even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point
because it is a new way of seeing the world  of seeing our place in it
very good  now if you will excuse us for a moment
i did
well we are happy you are here come inside
well i guess you would call us new yorkers
new yorkers
i took a different route
new yorkers
no i mean someone considerably older  your father perhaps
my father has gone to a better place
i am sorry i did not mean to
of course  you are just tired mara will you look after alexander tonight
i suppose so
we do not know
we have to go after them find where  
alexander i know you are trying to help  but they do not come back
what do you mean
they have gone to a better place
you know that is not true
we choose to believe it
then it is time to change that 
we are what we are
we cannot change the day and the night alexander  this is the world
dean fulton
young man we have a way of doing things here  radical theorizing is not acceptable  have i made myself understood
now you are upsetting my fowl please go
that is quite enough kalen
that is it like where you come from
i am  are you a climber
kalen right now you need to go up to bed  you are exhausting alexander
you will tell me more tomorrow
they are here  they are inside the house  
no you are safe 
they are inside 
must be all the exercise i get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb
for our sake i hope not
and you have no idea where he went
no sir
i am fine
[beat] listen i hate to bother you
then do not
but what about starks
what about starks
should we be
should we be what trying to change him any way we can [beat] yes
but the jacket i meanshould we be leaving him in like that
well what are we gonna do about it now
[beat] so they say [off becker's steady gaze] what
i am just looking at you does that make you uncomfortable
depends on what you are seeing
[beat] you do not believe me do you
it is not my job to believe you
are you kidding me he is not psychotic
then how would you describe him beth merely rebellious
in where
[uncertainly] in that thingthe jacket
that was not a fucking restraint
actually that is exactly what our equipment is
i do not give a shit about your patient
sit down mr starks sit down mr starks
my business
you killed him
i have managed to every sunday of my life [beat] some of us are god fearing men starks
and what does that mean
you in here [beat] works like a drug
i think you know your eyes say you do
[beat] you are his son
i know [beat] you killed me did not you
i know [beat] i knew that when you came out
it was part of the treatment i intendedi did not know what the effects would be
so what you guinea pig sick people to find out
the three of you were not regular patients you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove
no we were patients
no [beat] you put me on drugs and then you put me in the jacket
you may have known my father william starks
he did not either
oh yeah sure he killed a cop right
oh yeah what would he say
that is too bad
i thought you said you never knew your father
i did not [beat] did you have anything to do with his death
i never touched your father i swear
they should just be looking harder
later i will tell you about it later we got a session to catch now
[beat] what do you need me to do
[beat] thank you
i cannot take you out of here in your condition
and i cannot stay here in my condition i am going to die tonight it is already been decided
no it has not
yes [beat] it has everything up untill today is done everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs
no i do not i am sorry i wish i knew more
what about dr thomas becker or dr loel lorenson there was also a dr gries i think
unfortunately i am not familiar with dr becker and dr gries passed away three four years ago
mom he just fixed our car
jackie get in the car now
you two ok
our car will not start
yeah but i do not know what
[beat] that is your name
hey can you reach the gas pedal
dog tags [off her blank look] they have got your name and date of birth for identification
what for
[beat] in case you get lost or cannot remember who you are
william starks [beat] thanks
if you do not get out of my house right now i will call the police
what now you are gonna show me some kind of driver's license
no i do not have anything to show you i am here from a mental hospital
well you belong in one
you cannot be william starks he is dead
[beat] what
william starks is dead [beat] i have been to his grave
[beat] what
his body was found new year's day 191993 at alpine
no you did not they found william starks' body dead in the snow
how would he die
no it is not [beat] it is december 25th 2004
after i
i know
i know
how did they figure it out after i died
me neither who was the boy she was talking about eugene
i have no idea
you think lorenson kills you
maybe i do not know seems more likely becker does but at the very least she knows how i died
i do not know
they told me becker's in shelbourne now i looked him up and he was listed
i might not be able to
here drink this i will get the heat going
yeah i called the number yesterday to make sure thomas becker retired md
they are not
[beat lost] no
there are no cars on this street
then why is not there anyone around
[beat] i do not know
it is sunday
william you are not making sense
[beat] they are at church and i bet that is where becker is
no he did not
to the hospital
because your body can only take so much of what they are putting you through
then where are you going
nowhere [beat] i just think i am gonna be sick
good how is your mom
ok i guess
you are bleeding pretty bad there
i am doing fine
i do not understand
i still do not either even after all these years
i guess i would ask you why
because i do not think i am crazy
you are not crazy
i could try tomake it stop
no i do not want it to
so it is helping
believe me i know
i never knew my father did you
yeah i did [beat] he was my most memorable patient
you thought my father was crazy
i was working with a boy named eugene
[beat] i do not know
but dr morgan said you were around when my father was
how do you know about dr becker
my dad wrote some things down before he died
[beat] yeah it is
[beat] we will
i will die either way
you have no idea that is going on
no i do that is what i am saying to you
listen to me you do not the jacket is my only chance in this place
come on tell me what you do know
it does not look all that different
the future does not look different
no not for people like me [beat] not in the places i come from
what about the world
because i do not have time
why not
i am about to die unless i do something to stop it
and how do you know that
because of the future i know that is going to happen
william that is just another facet of my delusions
i do not know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions
no they are not my delusions look just leave my business with becker to me
you told me this was how it happened
i did
you have nothing to fear william
what for
you still do not believe me do you
i do believe you
no listen to methe kid eugene
listen to me that is all i ask
you will figure it out and you will do good by him
sure it is an easy address a little far out there but easy enough
tv helps numb [makes a crazy gesture] any active mind [sticking out a jittery hand] rudy mackenzie
do not you go to jail for that
i tried something like 30 times there is as starks rightly figures no suitable response to that
i was not talking about anything
yeah you were what you said about them taking me out to the woods
[cutting in] mackenzie listen to me listen i am going to die
mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with it means you are sane on some level
[gravely] no i mean in four days i am supposed to die
[beat] how do you know
the jacket
is it true
i doubt it [beat] i do not think prisongs so bad you do not want to remember it
where are you going
i am going to canada but i can let you ride with me up to the border
[beat] i am not deaf
[beat] thanks
i am not sure
let me ask you that again this time look around and consider your options
you do not have anywhere to stay
i do not think so
i am not sure [beat] i do not really know
of course you do not know
why of course
[beat] i was dropped off
do you have a motel or something money
no [beat] not around here
nothing [getting up] thanks for bringing me this far
where are you going you will freeze out there you do not even have a coat
i will manage
the best i could do with what was in your fridge
no it is fine [beat swallow] thanks
yup that is me
you like it
[beat] i do it
have you always been a waitress
[beat] why
[beat] real is overrated
maybe [beat] maybe not
you remember it
i guess not but as of now i never knew either
i am sorry
yeah [beat] how about you
yeah me too [softly] every day for the last ten years
that when you stopped being a nurse
what are you doing
of course our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khruschev sees fit to satisfy
did you have any indication of this from georgi any possible warning or sense of motivation
then you will call right
somebody had to say it i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser
that is all well and good but what do we say to 'em
he did not have to worry about nuclear weapons
you mean there's something more important than votes did not think i would live to see the day ken
i know cia and the military fucked us on the bay of pigs
it is too politicized with you in there anyway they need to be able to stick their necks out
he is right and things are happening too fast it smells like the bay of pigs all over again
give it a rest you were thinking the same thing just did not have the guts to take the heat
we cannot do that bobby
you cannot take him out this late in the game
zorin will eat him alive
then talk to your brother goddamn it the two of you do not need any advice to get into trouble
that is gotten into you
something your father would have come up with
 i am just trying to make a point this idea is that fucking bad
he better because nobody thinks he is up to this nobody
helen and i went out for breakfast excom's not supposed to convene til eight
we just got a second letter from khruschev the deal's off
what does the letter say
the jupiters are obsolete they were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway 
no ken i need to see him now
i think it is a bad idea
christ ken you know it is not that easy
yes it is
says what kenny
this is from the highest authority
time is of the essence
48 hours in 48 hours there can be no deals
still heading for cuba
all right then i guess it is time
we are not at war sir not until we are at defcon 1
i will be evacuated with the president
no i am glad i am home
busy but you have got his heart
i want an hour with him
i said his heart not his attention
three weeks before midterm elections you need me
well there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about
i am doing a piece on skybolt i hear macmillangs meeting with him in nassau
forget it scotty
he was
i am giving you a chance here talk to me you can influence how this thing unfolds
well you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi
this is about cuba
dean rusk
wrong and you get to wax my car
i uh
what about you where are you going
back to work
no you were not
i was you bastard
today for your information is pulaski day we are going to buffalo
not as far as the election goes
achesongs scenario is unacceptable and he has more experience than anyone
there is no expert on this subject no wise old man
cheer up you have neutralized the entire white house press corps for a day
you do not show for chicago everyone will know there's something going on
i do not care cancel it
no way
you are scared to cancel on daly
damn right i am scared
they want this fucking job they can have it it is no great joy to me
i know i know
any problems you remind them those chains of commands end at one place me
have to hope it is a signal that he will back down on the real issue too
then somebody would better deny it publicly
yeah a good political solution
zorin must not have gotten instructions somebody in their foreign ministry's blown it bigtime
they know each other khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies
you are sure
of course it is but the president needs to realize we are going to have to stop a ship eventually
six months from now i am not going to care are you we will deal with it
sleep is for the weak mr president
mr president we are receiving reports that the ships are stopping
captain belay that order  bob where is that coming from

i noticed
do you see a toilet here you think is really me
dowd eddie dowd
let's snuff this lowlife
i had a minute before the mapp hearing  but i could not get you on the phone eddie
yeah well i had reasonable cause to believe the judge might have heard of the fourth amendment
what about entrapment
not necessarily
i can describe it
oh really
i can see the hammer still it was cocked
how can you remember that
i did not take my eyes off it
no further questions
we had a description of the suspect
a description what asian male 18 to 30 black hair brown eyes
not at all 
kim's prints were all over it  he admitted it was his gun f'r godsake
your honor the witness' response was nonresponsive i ask you to strike it from the record
no no
you fucking swear to shut up
of course
through use of informants eavesdropping unreasonable search and seizure
right you are right
damn right i am right
 an angel dust dealer 
i am not a kid anymore i cannot be all over the map 
 a speed manufacturer 
so go take your job on wall street
look  i am tired i will see you in the morning eddie
with two knives taped to his hands forget it rog
what other case
eight years ago the chinatown hit
i do not know but it makes one hell of an opening statement
easy no we have to find some piece of evidence that got buried to reopen the sucker
are you sure we want that
eddie i do not know about this
a complaint followup form
what the lunatic who 
cecil stipe find it
have to no
saving it for the sunday times
 you found his mugshot
i did not ask for a closing argument
there's no one else to talk to the tattoos were phony
a spinal injury in the line of duty it was in kitty's report
roger baron
you sneaked a peek at the rolodex  nice
what do you mean
well i mean roeder's gone now a dead end believe me i am sorry too but
but what
i am eddie  we have got nothing
i have got a meeting in chinatown
let's get a cab
that is art esparza
i followed her from the courthouse
christ shu is innocent
everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right
 an hour  that is why i thought the morgue was on the other side of town
for ten years now
do you speak cantonese mandarin or both
 me neither
and i call your testimony hearsay i have no more questions for you
you are doing a murder case
it has not been that long
eddie i am not working on this case you boys have fun
kitty where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans
forget it you have blown your chance to participate in this case kitty
i am kicking myself eddie right out of here
dowd also reports that his team of private investigators
i embroidered
are close to naming the man they believe actually killed jimmy chin
i lied
eddie these things take time particularly at this hour
i am a professional eddie getting paid is all the thanks i require
i have not paid you
you do not drink booze
you do
eddie if i wanted to make love with you again i would do it sober
nothing has but that is all changing
i do not need sleep
i need sleep some of us are mere mortals
screw you too kitty
that is right
racist asshole came at me
exactly what happened then
i killed the motherfucker
i guess he wanted you to think he was somebody he was not
but why
maybe because someone's afraid
afraid of what
i do not know the truth maybe
 about what
about chinatown what went down
what went down
you tell me man
no you tell me shu
how can i tell you what i do not know
you cannot so tell me what you do know  say it
i do not know shit man goddammit 
well i know that you are innocent shu  even if you forgot
it is okay eddie
when i joined up i took an oath of secrecy i told you what you needed to know
jimmy chin was that selfdefense too
by trusting me shit man
hey chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency
they ggot the wrong gguy
yyes sir
did the police make any attempt to phone you to follow up
no ssir
thank you mr stipe
mr rabin has no right to 
don reynard
my staff tells me it is been mostly drug pushers i said that cannot be the same edward dowd
it is in the area of narcotics mr reynard that the government tramples on the fourth amendment
let's not drag the constitution into this
friday's the dropdead date on the offer
please do not bullshit me mr reynard you have got witness problems you have got proof problems
you are my only problem ed what does it take to make you go away
that is right
you are pissing me off again ed
you know you are very tense mr reynard y'oughta take a week off fly the wife and kids to oahu
no mr dowd you will see me in court i am prosecuting this case
the witness will substantiate mr kim's modus operandi it is circumstantial evidence in the case at hand
 in a context
i would need a continuance three weeks at least
did not this investigation with its attendant publicity catapult you into the office you now hold
if i were sitting where i normally sit i would say calls for speculation
mr dowd i was personally involved with all phases  and principals  of the investigation
and who were the detectives who assisted you mr reynard
the same three detectives on the jimmy chin case
and who was arturo esparza
 but you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation
i cannot be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact
i did not say he was an informant but since you mentioned it was not esparza your primary informant
you are trespassing into the area of witness protection mr dowd such showboating puts lives at risk
i think you are a dangerous man mr dowd
i hope so mr reynard
 eddie told you
i will take odds on cecil number two
so what would this guy do snitch off a dealer
 every word
but they have still got laura gordon  and she was the closest about 20 feet from the killer
should not one of us
no  leave him be it is better for everyone
i am roger baron i work with edward dowd
 what trial
i knew jimmy chin the boy who was shot okay
and you were at the trial to to see that justice was done
that is right
 why do not you ask chuckie
chuckie od would mrs esparza he is dead
i would tend to plead the fifth
mr ortega what is la compania
a cubano army basically inside and outside prisons
and its purpose
fighting the aryan warriors and the black guerrillas basically
for control of the prison drug trade
i would tend to plead the fifth
yeah we do some of that
what is your rank within la compania
i am a soldado in the gwing regiment
and what does a soldado  a soldier  do
a soldado he runs messages and materiel between the regiments
materiel what do you mean by that
cigarettes candy bars  pcp crack
if a member of the aryan brothers tries to cut in on your distribution
a soldado he takes care of it
by takes care of you mean kills
that is right
shu's the only one i know of
and why was an exception made
chinatown sounded pretty cold
you mean to say mr kim told you that he murdered jimmy chin
no they ggot the wrong guy i saw it the killer was not chinese
and you bbelieve that
i am fine
good  you ever been inside a hospital
she is the only nurse who is not testifying for the doctors
what did he find
very good
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr thompson
as far as we know nothing
the mangs an ambulance chaser
tell me about this case
no absolutely and we are going to see that it is not
well of course it is always dangerous
i know that answer if we went to trial would we win
we thought it was just
you thought it was just
yes it would be
and no one will know the truth
what is the truth
mickey told me to come back to work
yes get her on the phone
that was a dr david gruber's office
it looks that way
you know what that would mean
to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he will testify
a mrs doneghy called i told you that
frank galvings who's calling please bishop brophy's office
what does it mean
they want to settle  it means a lot of money
does that mean i am back for awhile
it is a crime
yes  it is a crime a serious crime
i would not do it
you would not
'they lied' indeed when did they lie and do you know what a lie is
i do yes
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago
that is not my handwriting
you have just said you signed it
yes i yes i signed it yes but i i did not write that figure
you did not write that figure and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years
because i kept a copy i have it right here
and why please tell us would you think that
that is correct i was engaged to render an opinion
engaged to render an opinion for a price is that correct you are being paid to be here today
just as you are sir

i will rule on that presently  proceed
you may step down
do not equivocate be positive just tell the truth
i was her doctor
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth nineteen seventy
i was one of a group of
when she
dr towler who was in the operating room with you
ms nevins nurseanesthetist dr marx of course
what did these people do when her heart stopped
we went to code blue
'code blue' what does that mean
well many reasons actually
tell me one
she would aspirated vomitus into her mask
she threw up in her mask let's cut the bullshit say it she threw up in her mask
that is right
and what did your team do
well we
you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear is not that what you did
we did everything we could
to save her and to save the baby is that
my god we tried to save her you cannot know you cannot know
tell us
i was telling your wife we have a very good case here
i doubt we will have to go to trial
we told them we did not want it to come out this way
i completely understand
we just
i understand  i went to the bar association they tell me you are going to be disbarred
it was good of you to meet
that is what i would planned to
i am going to take you to the home to see the girl
from what i have seen mr galvin you have a very good case
yes yes i think so i hope you will be comfortable i am putting you up at my
i made a reservation at
apartment  no no please you do not know who we are dealing with i please believe me they
what difference would
in your opinion what happened to deborah ann kaye
no you did fine
i am afraid that is not true  will you want me to stay on till monday
no no thank you doctor you go home
you know sometimes people can surprise you sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth
yes i yes
no no thank you you go home
then you are saying there's no negligence based on my question
i given the limits of your question that is correct
the doctors were not negligent
i um
why is that
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance she
that is what the sister said the chart said she ate nine hours prior to
she went in complaining of stomach cramps good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart
is that what a good doctor would do how old are you please
i am seventyfour years old
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics
i am on the staff of
actually yes it is by no means bad i
it is a common medical term
i yes it is
and you wrote that

deborah ann kaye
deborah ann kaye

i was held up
that is true sometimes they change sometimes they do not now i remember back to when you were disbarred
i was not disbarred they dropped the pro

read me what she said
who they are all testifying everybody who was in the or's going to take the stand

she did not do anything she took the patient's history and signed the charts 'kc'  'kathy costello'
the 'history'
how old are you how many children when did you last eat
the broad has disappeared
the hospital
you need some old forms that she had somebody's dying
hello this is mr dorchester in records we are looking for kathy costello
we got to talk
come on we will get a cup of coffee
i do not want a mistrial
i what are you talking about i talked to her this morning and she said
she told me
she did
i just saw her
in new york
yes that is correct
there are notations every thirty seconds
yes the roving nurse
but those notations stop  fourandonehalf minutes after deborah ann kaye's
we we were rather busy
fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped  and they resume seven minutes
as i have said we had some more
they start again three minutes earlier
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes  we were trying to restore her
what happened in those three
we were trying to restore her heartbeat
what happened in those three minutes
we would gone to 'code blue' we were administering electro
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat
because she was anemic  it is right there on her chart her brain was getting less oxygen anyway
so far you are great you got a cigarette
should i
that will not start no more fires  we might's well go home
yeah  no sense staying out here
let's go
wait a minute  wait a minute bombs do not unscrew
it is no meteor that is for sure
darnedest thing i ever saw  the way that is unscrewing
we would be in all the papers
hey how about that
come on out  we are friends
madrid has just blacked out nothing more coming through
the same thing that happened on our pacific coast  anything from them yet
all right  i have seen enough
i am looking for some pacifictech professors
there's nobody left around here now
there was a girl with themif i could find her
but i think i know where she will be
yesugly looking is not it
yesi was fishing up in the hills
you must have caught plenty with all that tackle
he is top man in astro and nuclear physics  he knows all about meteors
well i did a thesis on modern scien tists  working for my masters degree
did it do you any good
why sure  i got it  do you have a match
i am sorry  i do not smoke
how can you say that when you do not know him
that is he like
i might have recognized you without the beard  and you did not wear glasses on the 'time' cover
they are really for long distance when i want to look at something close  i take them off
there's only about one explanation for a thing like thisgot a pin
automobile ignitions are insulated
did not you have something to do with this  i know you sent word to the sixth army command
i just told them the local situation colonel heffner's in full charge now
you never know where you are going to wind up when you go to a square dance
can you handle one of these
sureget in
no  the air's going to be full of jets in a minuteand there they are
i bought it for the square dance i thought i ought to wear some thing western
it is gone now
where are we
no on the campus  i have not any family
i come from a big one  nine of us all in minnesota except me
i have no close folks  my parents died when i was a kid
it doesmaybe that is why i feel kind of lost right now
we will get safely out of here do not worry
but they seem to murder everything that moves
if they are mortal they must have mortal weaknesses  they will be stopped  somehow
hours  i have been so scared
it was  one of them
what was it like
i could not see much in the dark  but it was one
we are right in a nest of 'em  i have got to get a look at them
they could be as curious about us as we are about them
maybe   maybe they want to take us alive
it is blocked here too  they have pushed up earth or something all around outside  here this way
yes with these suits  we have used them before on atomic tests odd looking are not they
very futuristic  yours does not really go with that butch haircut
i could wear it longer  but it is less trouble this way
my kid brother has one  you know why
yes   fits better in a football helmet
how would you guess
that is the kind of a kid brother you would have
i wonder if they are going through this too
you will be all right with us  for as long as anybody's got
do not let's lose each other
how could it happen to everybody's watch together
have you got a pocket compass
it is pointing out to the gully  where that meteor came down
i think that  gizmo  is a machine from another planet
we better get word to the authorities and   look
it might give us something
it might give us time to search out some weakness in the martians
i believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood
no  i thought you had them
all right  i will get them   go ahead  go ahead  i will catch up with you
so is the town i notice
i warned you civil defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate
i just came to tell you  everyone has been alerted
it is always been a good persuader
could not you try to communicate with them first  and shoot later if you have to
not all  radio is out  but our field phones are okay so far
they will probably move at dawn
it was nearer than that
welllhow do you do dr forrester
there's a square dance at the social hall this evening
but they are not human  dr forrester says they are some kind of an advanced civilization 
if they are more advanced than us they should be nearer the creator for that reason
do to number threecome in
we are getting this under control will not need any more help  over
okay  send the tanker in but you stand by until that thing cools off over
i think somebody ought to check on it over

and jus when my baby's out on some texas road with a killer
that is not why i called

i want you to take care of sailor so he will not ever be able to bother my baby again
take care of him
i want you to get rid of sailor
get rid of him

how would i do that send him on a trip  like maybe to hawaii
santos why in hell do you insist on playing this stupid game
just tell me what you want
i do not need to explain anymore'n i have you know damn well
you need to explain it
all right i want you to kill sailor as simple as that
simple kill him how
that is your business i do not care how
like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt
no for god's sakes santos
well like kill him with the atomic bomb
shoot him
shoot him like with a gun
no in the brains what little i am sure he has
you want me to shoot sailor in the brains with a gun
why did not you send johnnie farragut
maybe i did try new orleans first lula cannot ever stop talking about that town
on one condition
santos no please santos
you are not telling me that you are sweet on him
no but
santos i cannot
shhhh it is all right also i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed
you fucker do not you ever touch lula  you fucker i will kill you
put your shoulders back
someone's gonna see us
that is just another part of the price to pay
santos you kill that sailor otherwise he is gonna turn my baby against me
shhhhhh  thank you gentlemen i will look after her now
there's no way in hell you can speak to her and
whattya mean
well johnnie told me you used to drive for clyde and santos
oh do not worry about that
just passing through on my way to who knows where
sure i figured i would see you sometime
hoping you could tell me if there's a contract out on me i really need to know
by who
i think santos or marietta fortune
heard you was going out with that bitch's daughter
you heard right
you really are one dumb asshole
life is unpredictable
yeah but i did and i told you all about it
is there a contract we made a deal once that we would tip each other off if we ever heard
i know i remember
that is pretty simplistic do not you think
hey pal you do not start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens
excuse me did you or did you not have a gun to his head
he was trying to steal my car
we are going to the mengs room only we might not make it in time
we are springing you leer get some pants on
the candelabras were my grangs
he is great come on let's blow before lo' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast
so i hear
no offense professor tripp but you look sorta crappy
he is right you look horrible
ah right well i gave you my opinion
you are welcome
brimming say hello to my new friend miss antonia uh
oh we are picking her up downtown
perfect well then shall we
if it can produce a miss sloviak you will get no argument from me
she is a transvestite
you are stoned
she is still a transvestite
great i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend think that might be possible
i do not know i am sort of at a critical juncture
i thought you were tinkering
i just mean
forget i asked i do not want to pressure you tripp but  i get pressure know what i mean
it was jerry nathangs he owed me money
he owes god money you know he queered himself for good with esquire
yeah between a bookie and a pair of broken legs
left you who emily
this morning i found a note in the kitchen
but why did not you say something tripp i mean what are we doing here
piss off crabs i lost a wife today
oh i am sure you will find another you always do
sara and walter declined guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog
i know he started it fall semester
he finished it winter break
no not yet he is not
well i am going to read it anyway
shut up and drink
huh uh a jockey his name's um curtis curtis hardapple
not curtis
vernon then vernon hardapple the scar's are from a  from a horse he fell during a race and got trampled
and now he is addicted to painkillers
he cannot piss standing up anymore
he lives with his mother
and he had a younger brother who was a
groom named claudell and his mother blames vernon for his death
because because
he heard everything we were saying
just go around him
where would we go
tripp where the hell
what ohhhh is that it
think hannah does james have any friends i mean besides you and me
james my james that is happened
nothing he is just been sort of i do not know kidnapped
kidnapped by who
his parents
good god let's go rescue him
good idea crabs only one problem i do not know where they live
ah wait a minute the university must know where he lives
it is a little late to call admissions
is it a little late to call the chancellor
maybe i do not know
only in your bones
bad enough and god knows i do not exactly fit the new corporate profile
which is
that is to tell
plenty i am sure but for what it is worth
i told you they keep him chained in the basement come on
so sensitive
oh come on tripp cut the kid some slack
i am afraid he is pretty worn out poor kid
nevertheless there's a police officer standing on the porch and i do not think he is going away
so that is the problem
there is no problem did i say there was a problem
the chancellor's here now
evidently  coming
find the jacket
oh huh exactly how do we do that
first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car
it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas
do not touch it
only now i am starting to think the car was not exactly jerry's to give
so whose car is it
my guess  vernon hardapple
the hood jumper
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his
such as
'that is my car motherfucker'
uh huh so we find vernon we find the car we find the car
we find the jacket
call it a hunch
i have an alternate version of the first chapter
you will be all right then look at carlyle when he lost his luggage
that was maccaulay
or hemingway when hadley lost all those stories
he was never able to reproduce them
in a sense
i do not think so in my experience signs are usually a lot more subtle
oh right oola about that jacket
ah well congratulations meanwhile what is james supposed to do pray for walter gaskell to come to his
walter gaskell is not going to send james leer to jail crabs i know that
do you know he will not expel him
no but i do not think that matters
that is very enlightened professor it is comforting to know that america's children have you for a teacher
gee i do not know crabs  improvise you are good at that
i peeked
jeff sorry i did not even know this was your house until about an hour ago
do not sweat it well 'night jeff
excuse me
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500 you driving this car
it is mine
bullshit it is mine motherfucker
you must be mistaken
you did
i have been doing that a lot lately
so i hear you have also been smoking a lot of marijuana i understand
do you think that is why i have been having these  spells
how long have you been having them
the last month maybe
how long have you been smoking marijuana
spiro t agnew was vice president i believe
that is probably not the problem then what about your lifestyle any major changes recently
i have been trying to finish a book
and your wife left you
is that in my chart
i spoke with the woman who saved your life you are lucky she came along when she did
her dog yes
actually it was her husband's dog
better luck next time
so is my friend is sara still here
no there's no one here
i have to see her as soon as possible
who's got a gun
you have got a gun motherfucker drop it
relax vernon
bullshit i know a gun when i see one and that is a gun
no really
a manhattan book editor murdering a mormon girl's clutch
'fraid so
and you are saying it is some kind of sign what the fuck's the matter with you
as long as it looks like her i do not care you know what i am saying
no sweat only do me a favor
could you hold on a minute honey
where are you grady an elevator
i am in kinship listen sara there's some things we need to talk about
you are in kinship
yes but that is not why i called
with emily
what no there's no one here i am just just
just what doing a little dusting
are you there to not reconcile with her
no sara you do not understand
trust me i understand i just want to say something to you grady
it is very convincing
it used to shoot these little paper caps but they do not make them anymore the caps
you carry firearms
no what gave you that idea
relax james i am not her father i just rent her a room
you are not like my other students james so what was the movie you two saw
huh oh son of fury with tyrone power and frances farmer
she went crazy frances farmer
so did gene tierney she is in it too
sounds like a good one
it is not bad
really that is remarkable
i have trouble sleeping while i am lying in bed i figure them out the stories
a little
so what are you doing out here
it is colder in there
you are right
i will miss my bus
this is worth it
that is really it
the one she wore on her wedding day
so i am told
like the lady herself
i guess walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things
you are really good friends with the chancellor are not you
you mean with your wife leaving you and all  hannah mentioned something about it about a note
yes well it is complicated james i think we should go now
i had to did not i
could not you have just pulled him off me
no he was crazy i did not  he looked  i thought 
okay okay take it easy do not freak out on me
he is dead james believe me i know a dead dog when i see one
yea james
what are we going to do with
i have got tenure
that is just what they used to say in the ads come on crabtree i know you are holding
whose tuba is that anyway
miss sloviak's
can i ask you something about her
she is ah here we go
most of the time he is james some of the time he is not now what do we have here
no thanks i am fine without them
is he all right
that is he saying
mmrrmmm knap sap
you are welcome
i put you on the floor
i guess there's probably a story behind that
there is but it is not that interesting
what would he say
that is a big book you are writing
i think it is sort of writing itself at this point
wow hannah always swore you were working but 
no one seems to know where you live james hannah thought you would like my couch
and and before that did i do anything anything bad
well james you did shoot the head of the english department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia
well done james
i guess there's probably a story behind that
there is but it is not that interesting
so where have you been staying
the bus station
but james i mean how long
a couple weeks that is why that is why i had the gun for protection
jesus james you should have told someone
shit james you are hungover what do you think's the matter with you
yeah well actually
jesus james wow
where is that
outside scranton
i never heard of it
it is a hellhole three motels and a mannequin factory my dad worked there for thirtyfive years
your father worked in a mannequin factory
whatever kind they wanted her to be
james leer are you telling me your mother was a stripper
when we fall we fall hard
maybe i just needed the moment to present itself
unless i miss my bet my wife
that is right that one
how can you tell
you can see the outline of a butt
smoke the rest of that joint james and you can start on the box
she came here we will just wait in the meantime i need you to shimmy through
oh right well let's try not to think about that
i just wanted a little sip tell me james exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy
probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night
it was not her dog it is her husband's   who said anything about girlfriend
james fall semester first day of class it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat
because of my coat
not you your talent
the hell i am
yes you are my stuff stinks i know it you said so yourself
i never said that
arsonist's daughter meant something
in a minute get us a table
no thanks
that is why you are having them your spells
spells jesus james you make it sound like we are in a tennessee williams play i do not have spells
what would you call them then
i do not know 'episodes'
i eat
nowhere you just sit here and eat
james like it or not they are your parents
parents they are not my parents they are my grandparents my parents are dead
six their plane went down right outside scranton
near carvel
that is why she hates me that is why she makes me sleep in the basement
in the crawl space with the rats and the casks of amontillado come on up
ah wear whatever you want
i am fine right fit as a fucking fiddle
i am not worried you are not worried are you professor tripp
i am a little worried james
do not be i do not care if they expel me i probably should be expelled
well let's see if we can keep that from happening
yes james
even if i end up going to jail
i think so what about you
me sure why
just checking
ail right by the way his friend
the answer's yes i think yes i do not know where are they exactly
james will know about george sanders
i would if i knew where i was taking him
hannah are you telling me you do not know where james leer lives
some apartment somewhere but i have never seen it
that strikes me as odd
hhuh last time i saw it was
the one in your office it is the best one for naps
oh well i
he shot the chancellor's dog did not he the blind one
actually he is not the chancellor's  what
crabtree he does not even know james
who does
i told you sewickly heights
but where i need the street
i do not know grady i just dropped him on a corner
it beats 'that is your major'
sure the keys are on the dresser next to to your book
that good huh
no it is not that it is
i got the message you called too
i am sorry it is these goddamned shoes i do not know how anyone actually walks in these things
well then i would better show you terry 
all right this morning 
i am pregnant
well this is surprising does walter
i think walter would find this a little more than surprising
she is left before
she is left the room before she always came back
if she is not now terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening
has he asked to see the book yet
no maybe i do not know i do not know what i am going to do
neither do i
i guess you are going to have to chew it off then
is the thing  is it over
almost want to sit up  that is the matter
nothing i think i twisted my 
no really sara i do not think you 
you love emily i know that and you need to stay with her
i do not think i really have a choice in that emily left me
she will come back that is why i am going to to not have this baby
no there's no way i mean do not you think there's no way
it is  it is a souvenir of baltimore
i love you grady
totally i am sorry a lot was happening this morning can you talk
you heard how
a twelveyearold policeman came by the house this morning
did you confess
really that was fast
i am kidding hello
oh right ha listen about last night there is something i need to tell
are you limping why are you limping
hub oh well that is part of what i need to
did you pass out again grady did you fall somewhere
no i mean well actually yes sort of i do not remember listen sara i have to tell you something
all right
really sara i
i know that i know that is at stake here
no i do not think you do and besides i have not decided yet
about the baby
that and you
james leer
that is he doing out there
i am sort of helping him work through some issues
i am sorry sara i have been trying to tell you it is all my 
over there in the backseat of the
are you sure you parked it there
of course i am sure ah christ the puberty police are back
would walter really press charges
i think i might have
and what do you think you might have said
i think i might have said i was in love with you
he told me
and what did you say
i said it did not sound like you
i believe you did that nice doctor let you out or is this you improvising again grady
i am through improvising
terry told me about wonder boys is it true did you lose it all
i lost it all
oh grady you are such a putz
i know
and you are old
dozens it is very sad
some times
i told walter
does he still love you
it did not come up
i know but sometimes
terry was telling me about you on the plane it was all so interesting
why yes how did you know
lucky guess
it is mrs gaskell's her hobby
he is still barking at me he is blind
i am your man
james is i do not know
disturbed and when your friend crabtree gets done with him he is going to be even more disturbed
i am not sure that is possible
sure it is
tony now that i am home
tony i am sorry if things did not work out so well for you tonight with terry
forget it i should have known better your friend is just i do not know into collecting weird tricks mind
that is that
he would call it habit but now i get the feeling he is going through the motions a bit
jesus is that what he told you
it is a bathtub what she is standing under
it is grady walter
i know it is you grady i just christ grady do you know what time it is
i have eightfifteen that is not right is it
it is threethirty grady
this is important
what is it grady
i am in love with your wife

well jeez you are reading his biography are not you
her husband
taking the long way home
hey professor tripp
only when i am working
as a heart attack
thanks  whoa professor tripp careful here
well i am sure with the proper guidance he will be fine
i was thinking of you
oh i do not think there's any danger of you aging prematurely grady
i do not know if she would want me to tell you that grady
i am not going to stalk her hank i just want to know where i stand
i  just want to say i am sorry
she is in philadelphia seeing linda aahby the neurologist
neurologist why that is wrong
nothing's wrong they went to wellesley together
horses right vernon something  hardapple
huh oh someone pulled a b&e on dr gaskell's closet and the dog's missing
that is weird
no the dog
just kidding
that is all right we will find him
no i am going ho 
mr crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself only he could not remember how
pills august 25 1972 in a costa brava hotel room
just a few then the big ones
i doubt i would recognize a '63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it
you would recognize it if you tasted it
i doubt it darling
well q certainly will and given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour
you want to keep him happy
if he is happy  i am happy
took some talking to convince your super i was a relative
i told her all my relatives are good looking

i was just thinking of the noise
i like the noise
how is she
annette she is good tense

i am working on it
is it because of anna
i do not know she will not talk about it
you are the only one in the family who still talks to me
this little table is one heavy bitch
it is a nice table
yeah it is really nice
it was a beautiful present
then why the fuck are you giving it back to me
you need a table
she was going to throw it out was not she just toss it like a scrap of wood

c'mon walter
you should see my appointment book it got crazy
it is not what you think

you are a good man walter okay you did some wrong things but inside you are a good decent man
maybe i am not a good man maybe inside i am bad and i will always be bad
do not talk like that
you do not have to tell me this
i am just talking man
carlos i never raped a woman
i know i am just saying i understand
did you ever do you have feelings for anna
i mean feelings
in that birch tree is a nest
is that right
i do not like starlings
why not
they are extremely aggressive birds plus their habits are rather filthy
the mother sure has her hands full
when i go birdwatching it is why i like coming here
it is just a city park
their sound is quite musical
how does it sound
it is hard to describe
i bet you can
it is a bright sound
that was terrific
you should hear the bird
you live around here
not too far  are you a birdwatcher too
me nah i am more of a people watcher
were you watching me
do you come here often
my daddy likes me home before dark
it is good to listen to your daddy
not yet
it is my bird book
i have friends
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends
i am not pretty
well not in the common way
it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked most people only notice birds with the brightest colors
have a seat
i have no idea
i think you do
why do not you just tell me
then you will not mind if i look around
i would
got something to hide
does not everybody
i could get a search warrant
if you could you would have brought one today
who said i wanted to buy it
they grow outside do not they
do you believe in them
i do not know
sure you do he cuts open the wolf's stomach and the girl steps out alive
little red riding hood
know what
i will be asking the questions  last night you hear anything unusual screams shouts
i was asleep
i did not say what time the assault occurred
you said last night i went to bed pretty early
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty
i went to bed around seven
i could take you downtown
you could it would be a waste of your time though
i have a passionate girlfriend
that is with the boxes
you are a cop figure it out
i would say you are moving
it is a free country is not it
i count my blessings
well i guess i will be seeing you
'fraid not
i am adjusting okay
and your new apartment
apartment's okay
are you taking your medication
it gives me headaches
but you are taking it
you are in
why's that
you do not want to know but he is damaged goods  real damaged goods if you know what i mean
yeah marykay i think i do thanks a bunch for the advice
lovers' quarrel
if she is here tomorrow i will fucking kill her
can i ask how old you are
i am twelve
no you are not
a long time ago i was sent far away when they let me come back all my friends were gone
it sounds like you were banished
banished yeah
no thank you
are you sure
i am sure thank you all the same
that is okay does not matter
do you want me to sit on your lap
they could be finches i do not know we should go before it gets dark
does he
ms kramer
tell ms kramer what your daddy does
i cannot
yes you can robin
what will happen if i do
someone will talk to your daddy and then he will stop doing those things the things you do not like
your daddy will always love you
how do you know
i know because it is just something i know
i do not want to hurt my daddy
robin listen to me
you should go home
cannot i stay a little longer
it is getting dark go home
will i see you again
the job's okay
do i take okay to mean you feel good about working there
i said the job is okay
that is right you did  have you made any friends there
i am not running for mr popularity
you seem a little hostile today
that was a joke
no need to call me doctor i am a therapist not a psychiatrist
it is all the same
a diary
that is right
no way
why not
diaries have sent too many guys to prison
i do not understand
of course
it was just an idea
bad idea
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect
you think reflection is good
it is very good indeed
how is that
no fucking way
then think about it
i am still thinking about it
i wish you would give it a try
it is okay
but you do not like coming here be honest walter
honest no
good that is an honest answer and why do not you like coming here
honest your cheery personality makes my skin itch
is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch
forget it
maybe it is the way i look or the sound of my name
rosen i do not have a problem with that
because if you did i know a therapist named ryan i also know a therapist named chung
i do not need someone else
i do not feel anything
you have no feelings for your niece
she was born after they put me away how can i have feelings
then why are you talking about this
have to talk about something
what are you afraid will happen
i am not that crazy
do you think you are crazy
if i am not then what the hell am i doing here
why do you think you are here
you know why it is part of the parole deal
is that what you are angry about
talking to you is like riding on a merrygoround
we have a few more minutes
i mean when will i be normal
we have a lot of work to do
will i ever be normal
i could not say
you could not say
i am afraid not
do you know what normal is
i suppose it is however society defines it
how do you define it
i do not
then how do you know if your patients are getting better
they usually tell me
how do they know
what is your idea of being normal
what is your idea of being a jew
then go see a therapist who will tell you you are normal
fuck you rosen
i know 
you do not know
i know you are frustrated walter but 
what did you think would happen
i do not know
what did you want to happen
i do not know
is this the first one
of course it is that is why i am telling you
i want you to calm down
i want to talk about it now
we will talk about it more on thursday
remember when you asked me what my idea of normal was
go home walter
i said i was sorry
i cannot move my patients around to accommodate one person
you mean my problem
if by problem you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes
i do not know
that is not a helpful answer
that is my answer
i am relaxed
close your eyes and let your mind be blank
hey rosen you going to hypnotize me
okay eyes closed mind a blank i am all yours do it rosen
nothing can i open my eyes
no when i say the word pretty when i say the word pleasure what is the earliest memory you see
i do not see 
in your mind walter take your time
i see my sister
not so fast
sorry  where is she
in my bedroom sleeping
where are you
in my bed too
how old are you and your sister
we are little kids
but roughly how old
i am maybe about six which would make her four
just lying there  we are taking a nap
a nap
yes a nap kids do that you ever take a nap rosen
did you and your sister often take naps together
i want you back in your chair right now
all right
i do not like nobody behind my back
i am sorry i should not have been there
this is garbage
i am only asking questions
okay i will tell you what i did  just to shut you up  i smelled her hair
what else
that is all i just liked smelling her hair
you felt pleasure
i was six years old
i meant later when you two took naps
all right a small house with small rooms
i smelled her hair that is it i just liked smelling her hair
i feel okay
yeah i am fucking fantastic
i am all right
it is fucking freezing out here
what picture
i am talking about you
no weirder than a sharp young good looking woman working in a lumberyard
that is weird about that
most women would not choose it
guess i am not like most women
i am just quiet
you do not hang out with the other guys
neither do you
they are all assholes
i thought you were a dyke
what do you think
i will buy a plant
k through sixth
does not it get noisy
i like the noise
my place faces a truck street i have got cracks in every window from the shaking
you must hate it
i go backpacking a lot lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two
what about them
they could eat you
yeah they could
i get that impression
so that is your dark secret
why do you want to know
do not you think i should know before we have sex
not tonight
you are still here
i did not say i did not enjoy it
of course sorry i am such a fucking asshole
no you are not
do not tell me i am not a fucking asshole when i know i am a fucking asshole
you think i have a problem
do you
it is been a while since
since you have had sex
maybe later
how about in the morning
the morning
i thought i would stay the night
what for
well walter this is going to sound offthewall but i like to sleep with a man after we fuck
i suffer from insomnia
is that all
when i do sleep i sweat a lot usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming
i sleep like a dead horse anything else
because i like you
the worst
i molested little girls
molested little girls
twelve years in prison is no joke
how many girls did you molest
it is not what you think
how young
twelve years in prison
i told you i am not easily shocked
you should be shocked or do you get off on this shit
hey i am not 
depraved my mistake
no never again
you do not really 
yes i want to know
do not be sorry for me i did those things no one else did i am dealing with that
my father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave
why young girls walter
their power they seduce me
they seduce you
i was always the one seduced
you really believe that
no that is what i used to tell myself
and what do you tell yourself now
nothing it is over
i know
most people say the odds are against me
what odds
the percentages 
which brother did this
all three  in chronological order
you must hate your brothers
i love my brothers
no you do not
are you serious
not ever
not ever
i am not scared
neither am i
maybe you should be
live together
move in with me
i think it is a fucking good idea
just think about it
i have got problems
who does not
most people do not have my kind of problems
guess that makes you pretty special
that is not what i meant
that is it look like
everyone needs a plant this ivy is one tough baby it is a cutting from one of mine
you are such an asshole
i am not scared
prove it
do what
sneak up behind me like that
that is your fucking problem
why's it always my fucking problem
do you want to talk about it
i need a shower
not when they fly
she will wait
fine cannot you see so yourself
wait for what
you will get over it soon it is the usual anxiety
a little more so this time
so it will just take you a little longer to get over it
there you go must you always spoil everything
i am thirsty
what after giving us such a run around
this one is gorgeous
then why do not you try it on
i am certainly not going to swim across
we will send the raft back to you
no dad it is not
four or five days
to the fact of my retirement not only as a diplomat but also as a father
but how could you say such a thing
you already know what they are
you mean sandro do not you  well i beg of you please spare me that goodbye dad
it is the same thing goodbye dear
allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive
i am sorry sir i did not mean to put it that way but you must understand sir that i
i understand very well only i do not want any rash assumptions to be made
it takes about twenty to twentytwo hours for the current to reach here from lisca bianca
and you say that came from lisca bianca
that must be basiluzzo
sounds like the name of a fish  merluzzo basiluzzo
at what
at the ruins they are very ancient you know
have you decided
all i said was that it sounds like a good idea
that is patrizia's way of letting us know she is with us
more so than the shark
there's no comparison
then why do not we go up and see the ruins
but anna would not be staying with the kind of people who live here
maybe you would better ask him
what were you and anna arguing about excuse me for being so indiscreet but this is serious
that seems to apply to you also
how should i be  arrogant
but of course arrogant haughty has not anna ever told you
and that is what i say too we could have all been killed
oh no please not here  it looks too dangerous
and why have not they left each other
i am beginning to have my doubts it could not be that they are in love
could be they are the kind of people who are capable of anything
i i do not know i did not think it was worthwhile she was laughing over it
but why do not you tell him  a girl who was with us has disappeared
i am sorry about last night please forgive me
you are very fond of anna are not you
yes very much so
has she ever spoken to you about me
occasionally but always with affection
yes maybe that is better
yes i had also thought of going there to talk with them
yes you should go
but then when will we see each other
but sooner or later we have got to end this relationship and it is better to do it right now
me i i please leave me alone
no sandro please i ask you as a favor
but why claudia why
yes but it is all so conflicting however there is some slight indication
who knows why they all left
are you joking
oh sandro i am so ashamed of myself so ashamedi tried to hide myselfi feel so small i hate myself 
does it please you to say such things
oh no it does not please me at all
then why do you say them
i am sure you would be able to design some very lovely things
i do not know about that and then who's interested in beautiful things nowadays
what get married
yes we will get married you and i what do you say
and are you sure you want to marry me are you really surethat you want to marry me
that is why i asked you
hurry up now or it will begin to get hot outside
yes yes yes yes right away
so you wonder why
okay in a few minutes
and are not you pleased that way you will have a new kind of adventure
are not you going to change
you said you wanted to quit working for ettore
late very late
good night tell me that you love me
i love you
tell me once more
i do not love you
i deserve it
i would say he is pretty depraved
oh no quite the contrary he is really just a child
have you ever been in love
not really it is suffocating in here shall we go out
calm he does not seem so to me he was awake all night
to do what
i just cannot leave without first searching those islands one by one
but are not you tired i can just about manage to stand on my feet  raimondo
it was futile we went all over
you say that just to flatter me
do you consider that a compliment
but then why did you bother changing
quieter oh yes of course
what do you mean by sensible
it means being without money
i imagine he must be inside sleeping
more or less we are all afraid especially at night
i am afraid that anna has come back i feel she is back and that they are together
yes you are right i am sick and tired of being like that
to the shark
but for what reason should i come there
but why all nudes
i think all you have to do giulia is to close the door
i detest comparisons made with oil
you must know your third grade geography book inside out
there's a shark in the area do not move from where you are
who's moving
please giulia must you always emphasize the obvious i can see for myself that the weather is changing
but why what if it starts to rain
if it rains i will buy myself an umbrella
what do you think
really so that you can stuff it with your geraniums
when one approaches fifty my dear he is affected only by the cold
there too
well we are still in italy you know
we will try again
i was saying it might even be possible that anna had left with them
but for what reason would she have wanted to go away
this is claudia anna's friend  you have never met my husband have you
it would not really do you any harm to skip a meal
nothing nothing  at all i was just looking for sandro
and you expect to find him in here go and ask claudia
yes yes of course
ask her
i know we are but as the years go by we become even worse is not that so corrado
and where do you find the models
oh there are as many as one wants
i thought the model was something obsolete nowadays did not you claudia
but how could they pose like that i could not
why do not you try
me goffredo you are mad  he is mad
answer me why do not you try posing i will paint you a beautiful portrait
but why me ask claudia she is much more beautiful than me
but i want to paint you you appeal to me more
i appeal to you more
yes sir my sister is sick and my father too
i tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you
and who is she does she work in catania
yes she takes care of the garden
and what did they say about me
no not like this one
and why would not we have one like this
because this is a chinese radio
but for you what comes first music or love
unfortunately no
do not worry we have got everything
another thing there's an old man who lives here on the island
i know i know one thing at a time
and do you remember where she got off
wellprobably at the last stop which is noto
thank you
do not mention it pleased to be of service any time
no the owners are in australia
but where did you come from
from panarea why
what boat
just a moment ago did not you hear the sound of a motor
at this time of the year there are so many boats
and how come you are up so early
early is four in the morning early for you
anna is an excellent swimmer even with a cramp she would have managed to reach shore somehow
but you have to  consider all possibilities sandro
what do you want us to do i do not know myself but we will do something
i will go and get my valise
good then i will meet you there
yes we will
they did not seem too good
you should have told ettore he always manages to get what he wants
ettore must be fed up with me by now
lady patrizia
if womengs breasts were colored yours would be blue
you know i do not love anybody
take it easy raimondo why are you getting so impatient
claudia is not coming with us will you please take care of her luggage thanks
i would like to ask you something
wait a moment cannot you see i am busy
you are kidding
about fifty miles or so if you want i will give you the name of the storekeeper
pardon me but why must i do you a favor
then let's call it a business proposition something to round out your salary
one of the other sisters
oh for heavengs sake
i am there's too much flesh on me
why does it matter whether you are fat or not
i do i have to be attractive to god
he loves you the way you are
no he does not he hates fat people
who told you this
it is a sin to be fat
who tells you these things
christ said it in the bible he said  suffer the little children i want to suffer like a little child
that is not what he meant
oh my dear child
god blew up the hindenburg he will blow me up that is what she said
but she watches she listens
nonsense i am your mother now and i want you to eat
i am not hungry
you have got to eat something agnes
no i do not the host is enough
my dear i do not think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything
of god
yes of god
dear jesus
yes mother
it made them holy
i burnt them
say it
what do you mean
it is not my time of month
should you see a doctor
i do not know i do not know
that was the beginning the night of the conception that is why she burnt the sheets
no i do not
i just heard you
that was not me
was it sister marguerite
has not anyone ever told you that before
let's talk about something else
what would you like to talk about
i do not know
anything may i sit down
god  but there's nothing to say about god
second thing that comes to your mind
right now
uh huh
i love you
agnes have you ever loved another man other than jesus christ
well do you love do you love father martineau
oh yes
do you think he loves you
oh i know he does
he is told you
no but when i look into his eyes i can tell
you have been alone together
and you like that
oh yes
where do you meet
in the confessional
would you like to talk about it
i never saw any baby i think they made it up
why should they
i do not know
do you remember the night they said it came
no i was sick
how were you sick
something i ate
did it hurt
and what did you do
i went to my room
and what happened
i got sicker
and then what
i fell asleep
in the middle of all the pain
what baby
the baby they made up
from their heads
is that where they say it came from 
no they say it came from the waste paper basket
where would it come from before that
from god
after god before the wastepaper basket
i i do not understand
agnes how are babies born
do not you know
yes i do  but i want you to
would you like to ask them
what do you mean
just that you ask and i will answer
martha louise livingston
are you married
not at the moment no
do you have any children
i cannot have them any more
why not
i have stopped menstruating
why do you smoke
does it bother you
no questions
from their mothers and fathers of course before that i i do not know
no do you
why should i
i do not know
she was kind to me she told me i was beautiful
what else did she tell you
she said all of god's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could i liked that
no only when she felt like it she brought me up here last winter and the next day she died
no wonder wait agnes agnes how do you feel about babies
numbers you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end
i do not understand them either do you suppose i was dropped on my head
i hope not it is a terrible thing to be dropped on your head
oh i have got to give up smoking agnes  wait a minute agnes slow down
oh it is even more wonderful then
where did you go
oh no place as wonderful as this agnes have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else
no there is nothing else just being here at night helps me sleep
you have trouble sleeping
i get headaches mommy did too oh but she was not stupid she knew things that nobody else knew
what things
she knew what was going to happen to me that is why she hid me away
how did she know that
somebody told her
i promise i will not laugh who told her
an angel when she was having one of her headaches
did your mother see angels often
no but i can never tell her that
why not  mmm
she would get angry
i could never be a mother
why not
well i do not think i am old enough and besides i do not want to have a baby
why not
because i do not want one
if you did want one how would you go about getting one
from someone who did not want to have a baby
like you
a mistake
agnes how did your mother get you
a mistake it was a mistake
is that what she said
i cannot help it if i am stupid
 that you do not remember getting pregnant
not my fault
 and that you do not believe you carried a child
i was a mistake
what the child
everything i do not have children
i am not sick
but you are troubled are not you
that is because you keep reminding me if you go away then i will forget
and you are unhappy
everyone's unhappy you are unhappy are not you
sometimes yes
i am always bad
what did you do
i breathed
i cannot
she is dead is not she
she can
agnes i do not believe that tell me i will protect you from her
she tells you you are ugly
she says my whole body's a mistake
how does she know that
her headaches
oh yes
and then
please  i want to help you let me help you
no i am not
are you pretty
no i am not
are you intelligent
yes i am
you are a mistake
do you really love me or are you just saying that
i really love you
as much as mother miriam does
as much as god loves you
doctor livingston
and why am i here
to help me
good would you like to tell me why you are here
because i am in trouble
what kind of trouble  what kind of trouble agnes
of what
of telling you
but it is easy it is just a breath with sound say it what kind of trouble
i had a baby
it came out of me
did you know what was going to come out
why were you afraid
because i was not worthy
to be a mother
no not yet agnes very soon but not yet how did the baby get into you
it grew
what made it grow  do you know
i cannot tell you that
will she be angry
she made me promise not to
hm hmm what did you have for dinner
fish   brussel sprouts
you do not like brussel sprouts
i hate them
we went to chapel for vespers
hm hmm
i left early because i was not feeling very well
someone's following me
what else
a crucifix
above the bed  any anything else what do you you see something different  what is it
a wastepaper basket
do you know who put it there
for me to get sick in
are you ill
i feel as if i have eaten glass
what do you do
i have to throw up
i do not know which one 
of what
of me oh god  my god  water it is all water
why is not anyone coming
they cannot hear me that is why  oh god i do not wanna
is someone in the room with you
no do not hit me please
what did she mean
and the passage to the barn
she would seen him too
so she sent you
agnes who did you see
i hate him
of course you do who was it
i hate him for what he did to me
agnes who did this to you
agnes you will not burn in hell it is alright to hate him
it was alive was not it
i do not remember
i put her to sleep
h how
i tied the cord around her neck wrapped her in the bloody sheets and stuffed her in the trash can
nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison
the longer you take to make a decision the more difficult it will be for us
and the sooner she goes to prison the better off she will be
larry there's got to be something missing
i gave you the pictures marty what else do you want
something they that they overlooked
what  you think that the girl is innocent
i do not know
you got to be crazy
maybe there's something that is not in the report that should be
you are too involved marty  jesus look at you why do not you turn this case over to someone else
what about roger he is free
look there are a lot of unanswered questions here
why  you have done nothing to show any progress
yes that is because i am getting to her
you are getting to all of us martha let's face it
i will have a decision by next week
it is gone on long enough you are out
oh joe joe she did not kill the baby
you have proof
i will have it
i can get you new evidence next week
shut up i am trying to watch this
it is your favourite
who are you
it is martha mama  there you go
marie brings me icecream too you know chocolate my favourite
i thought cherryvanilla was your favourite
not any more now i like chocolate
did you have a good week mama are they treating you all right
who are you
i i am martha mama
how do you survive
no we work the land alone noone but sister marguerite and i are permitted contact with the public
sister anne which was agnes' room
the one up on the third floor
your mother was a resident of saint catherines home before you moved her
what does this have to do with
who told you this
do you still go to church
what business is it of yours
oh we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case
look father ah just because i do not subscribe to the to the beliefs you subscribe to
but what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever doctor but it does make all the difference to agnes
i do not understand are you expecting me to
well somone's got to suffer for this doctor you have got to be merciful and quick excuse me
yes i
you can call me sister
 thank you
two packs a day
i can beat that
she undressed alone she bathed alone
is that normal
she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to
did not she have any physical examinations in this time
we are examined once a year her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits
who was the father
i have not a clue
what man had access to her
none as far as i know
was there a priest
yes but i
that is his name
father martineau but i do not see him as a candidate
could there have been anyone else
obviously there was
and you did not try to find out who
believe me i have done everything possible short of asking agnes
why have not you asked her
look someone gave her the baby
do not ask me those questions dear i am not the patient
well i am the doctor i am the one who's going to decide what is or is not important here
i believe agnes is different
from other nuns  yes i i have noticed
from other people  i believe she is not crazy nor is she lying
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth
because she is an innocent she is a slate that is has not been touched except by god
that is ridiculous
no not in the eyes of the police
and in your eyes
i have already told you what i thought
that she was unconscious yes  so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the
you do not really believe something like that happened do you
it is possible is not it
that possibility never occurred to you
noone knew about agnes' pregnancy noone not even agnes
oh come on you have talked to her she does not even know how babies are born let alone made
when did you first learn about her innocence the way she thinks
shortly after she came to us
and you were not shocked
i was appalled just as you are now
and what happened
she stopped eating completely
about two years before
it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again
she had a a hole in the palm of her hand  she could have bled to death
i know what you are thinking she is a hysteric pure and simple
not simple no
i saw it clean through the palm of her hand do you think hysteria could do that
it is being doing it for centuries she is not unique she is just another victim
god's victim that is her innocence she belongs to god
and i intend to take her away from him that is what you are afraid of is not it
i hate ignorance and stupidity
the catholic church
i have not said anything against the the catholic church
how dare you think i am in a position to be pressured
i am
no you are shielding her let her face the world
oh some time in january
do you remember anything unusual happening at the time
was the child full term
oh dear god
what is it
the sheets
what sheets
oh dear god i should have guessed
the twenty third of january on that night one of our elder nuns passed away
sister paul
yes i do not remember where agnes was i was needed in the sick room
about what
your niece
i did not tell you because i did not think it was important
no it just makes you doubly responsible does not it
she drank too much that is what killed her
do you know what she did to her
i do not think i care to know
she molested her
oh dear god
there is more here than meets the eye is not there  lots of dirty little secrets
oh god if only i would known
why did not you  you knew she was keeping her home from school you knew she was an alcoholic
i knew that after the fact
why did not you do anything to stop her
because i did not know 
oh god
i would like yours too
do not deny it
i have not decided yet
the womangs health is at stake
her spiritual health
i do not give a damn about her spiritual health
i know you do not
she is happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone
then why did you call the police in the first place mother huh
catholic church does not have a corner on morality
who said anything about the catholic church
you just said
what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you
that is all  that is enough  she was a beautiful little girl
and what has that to do with it
no because i yeah yeah i left the church cause i had freckles
no it reminds me
would you like one  huh
i would love one
all right
fine thanks
do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then
undoubtedly not the ascetics of course but well saint thomas more
long thin and filtered
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet  and of course 
hand rolled
even christ would partake socially
saint peter
oh you have come a long way baby
and saint john would chew tobacco
there are no saints today good people yes but extraordinarily good people those i am afraid we are sorely lacking
do you think they ever existed
yes i do
do you want to become one
become  one is born a saint
well you can try cannot you to be good
listen to her singing
i would like to begin
begin what
the hypnotism do you still disapprove
would it stop you if i did
of course
then let's begin
no no i said leave her alone
you are what
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes we will find our own thank you 
one that will ask the questions you want asked
one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect
for the church
for agnes
you think she is a saint
she is been touched by god yes
who is he
why must he be anybody
my god you are as crazy as
stop laughing i do not say it is the truth i am saying
well give me a reasonable explanation
you will never find the answer for everything god did
i thought you did not believe in miracles today mother
but i want the opportunity to believe i want the choice to believe
that is what i have to believe
somebody told her
who  that tun that tunnel has not been used in fifty years
oh would you stop lying mother
why would i lie
who was that person mother  was it you
where is she
has not she had enough
i have a few more questions to ask her
my god but you are determined
why do you insist upon pressing
was it you
is it because she is a nun
did you know she was pregnant
i did not guess until it was too late
for what  an abortion
oh do not be ridiculous
too late for what
i do not know too late to stop it
the baby
the scandal
you went to the room to help with the birth
she did not want any help
you wanted that child out of the way
that is a lie
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room
i did not hide it i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets
and the baby
i left it with her and i went for help
i doubt that is what she would say
then she is a liar
agnes what happened to the baby
she cannot remember
what happened to the baby
was not it
oh not at all i let them have twentyfive sure are not there four of them
how fascinating do go on    john
 oh i am all heart ma'am all heart  well i let

we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly but we ran a backtrace just to make sure
yeah  turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace
okay give me the numbers
a threesecond burn to port on my mark
it is on the board
that is happening
cassie thank christ  we are under attack
we are what
too many
we are not gonna make it are we
what  that is wrong  what is it
coming up the central reservoir
quick  run a trace on the culvert leading off the autoshop maintenance pit
get her online  now
keep trying
shit  when
you win some you loose some
sounds like a couple of escape shuttles
we ran a trajectory simulation  if they carry on along that path it is possible they will make intraorbital insertion
match it
the door's sealed from inside  doc revna's in there and it sounds like ackland's going nuts
force the door
that is our weapons situation
has anybody talked to them
not yet
do it
about thirty minutes  those are slimmeddown tanks so no stopping to admire the scenery
hey  i was in shape before we started doing this
that is what i mean  this is the quietest i have ever heard it  it is unnatural
i dunno
goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies
that is a fact
i have seen this mother de vries  we can bag it no problem
forget it man
c'mon de vries  think of the bonus
fuck the bonus  i hate heights  you would not get me up there even if it was not night
hey fair enough  if you will not come i will handle it myself
anything you say mammacitta
yeah i got it
it is moving slow  about eleven metres on the left
that is wrong
i am picking up another signal
just behind us over to the right
yeah i
it is alright it is cool
is it still moving
no he is stopped he is totally still just take it nice and easy babe nice and easy
couple more seconds
york just turned up outside  we are trying to get him into infirmary
where does that lead to
that is the problem
she was running a little sluggish on the way back  think the turbines might be playing up
give me twenty minutes and i will do it myself
appreciate that
have you got an updated lloyds' almanac to crossreff them through
done it already  nothing matches
just give them the facts  they can leap to their own conclusions
get off an allbands emergency distress and put it on a repeater
what is that
looks like it
well try the headset
what  why
forget it  i would not ask somebody to do something i would not do myself  where is the disk
okay i pull the access panel off of the console  insert the disk and press the green enabling button
right  autoshop you all set
blow those suckers driscoll
i just wanted to be put on my own for a while  clear my head
did not feel like whooping it up with the rest of us blue collars huh
not too much of the socializing type then
no not really  more sort of the  'claustrophobic' type
is that a fact
six month stint on datus
only six
what is this  'twenty questions'
just curious  there's a lot of talk goes around
real mang drink
'we'  you wanna fly out there with me
sure  do me good to stretch my legs
there would have to be a helluva good reason for him not to
check out the tent
hold on
ah do not worry about icc  they are the least of your problems right now
what do you mean
again  how long before we start noticing the difference
detour  other way's blocked
do not wait for me
what can i do
i can feel it moving around inside me you have got to kill me
i i cannot
you have to
camped out by the navibeacon out on linsongs range  they are making their own way back tomorrow
tactical nukes maybe
yeah 'good evening' to you too
nah i will stick it out for another hour or so
what time's sundown
about five minutes
give me a yell is something happens
you got it cowboy
miss harringtongs resting mr dewitt she asked me to see who it is
it is a very famous name mr dewitt
and what is your name
why not tell me phoebe do you want some day to have an award like that of your own
certainly mr dewitt
i expected to find this little room overcrowded with a theater full of people at your feet
i consider myself lucky they did not throw things
it is not modesty i just do not try to kid myself
a revolutionary approach to the theater however if i may a suggestion
please do
it need not be
i would love to or should i pretend i am busy
let's have a minimum of pretending i will want to do a column about you
i am not enough for a paragraph
i can wait where would you like to go we will make this a special night
you take charge
i believe i will
i am not surprised after all that humble pie
nothing of the kind karen and i had a nice talk
she mentioned of course that margo expects to play the part
just like that
do you know eve  sometimes i think you keep things from me
it was not meant to be
and tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of immortality
are not you
frankly  yes
you know me better than that
paved with what then
almost four
plenty of time for a nice long nap  we rehearsed most of last night
you could sleep too could not you
why not
why would call me a killer
did i say killer i meant champion i get my boxing terms mixed
lloyd i never have any and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish  so he sent it up
some plain soda  lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven
that is for tonight you are invited we are having everyone up after the performance
we are
lloyd and i
i did not mean just the theater
what else
it is nothing of the kind lloyd loves me i love him
i know nothing about lloyd and his loves  i leave those to louisa may alcott but i do know you
i am in love with lloyd
lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america
you have no right to say such things
 and artistically the most promising eve dear this is addison
she does not know
we decided the night before last before we came up here
was the setting properly romantic  the lights on dimmers gypsy violins off stage
we sat and talked addison i want a run of the play contract
there never was there will never be another like you
well say something  anything congratulations skol  good work eve
i do not know what i take you for anything
look closely eve it is time you did i am addison dewitt i am nobody's fool least of all  yours
i never intended you to be
yes you did you still do
champion to champion
not with me you are no champion you are stepping way up in class
everything because after tonight you will belong to me
i cannot believe my ears
a dull cliche
belong  to you that sound medieval  something out of an old melodrama
then if you will not get out i will have you thrown out
what of it
but the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to new york  did not it
answer my question were not you paid to get out of town
she did like you she helped and trusted you you paid her back by trying to take bill away
that is not true
i was there i saw you and heard you through the dressing room door
yes addison
and you realize  you agree how completely you belong to me
yes addison
take your nap now and good luck for tonight
could not go on you will give the performance of your life
you can have one at max's
i do not think i am going
why not
because i do not want to
it is the same thing is not it
exactly  here take it to the party instead of me
you are being childish
very well i shall drop you and go on to the party i have no intention of missing it
well i cannot yell oh butler can i maybe somebody's name is butler
you have a point an idiotic one but a point
i do not want to make trouble all i want is a drink
miss caswell is an actress a graduate of copacabana school of dramatic arts  ah eve
that is how you met me in passing
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits
because that is what they are go make him happy
like i just swam the english channel now what
you next move it seems to me should be toward television
that is all television is my dear nothing but auditions
what makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair
this answer satisfies me a hundred percent
and too many of them are produced
hear hear
then you have heard too
i was there an eyewitness
you were there at the play  last night
a happy coincidence
it is new margo but she is just as late as the old one
she may be later than you think
dear margo you were an unforgettable peter pan  you must play it again soon you remember miss caswell
i do not how do you do
you have heard of her great interest in the theater
we have that in common
then you two must have a long talk
miss caswell at the moment is where i can lend no support  moral or otherwise
the ladies'  shall we say  lounge
being violently ill to her tummy
it is good luck before an audition she will be all right once it starts
over it cannot be i have come to read with her i promised max
the audition was called for 230 it is now nearly four
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy
i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy eve harrington
eve my understudy
did not you know
of course i knew
it just slipped your mind
frankly i do not remember
just slipped your mind
it was not reading it was a performance brilliant vivid something made of music and fire
how nice
in time she will be what you are
to the best of my recollection neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation
that is nice
geniuses do not need good luck  i do
maybe just a little around the edges
tomorrow we meet at city hall at ten   and you are going to be on time
is it sabotage does my career mean nothing to you have you no human consideration
show me a human and i might have
i am a junk yard
heaven help me i love a psychotic
real diamonds in a wig the world we live in
where is my coat
like a nylon lemon peel
byron could not have said it more graciously here we go
eve i would forgotten they grew that way
the lack of pretense that sort of strange directness and understanding
did she tell you about the theater and what it meant
i told her i sounded off
i understand they have got the indians pretty well in hand
i will try
you are not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy
everybody cannot be gregory peck
 you are a setup for some gorgeous wideeyed young babe
how childish are you going to get before you quit it
i do not want to be childish i would settle for just a few years
and cut that out right now
am i going to lose you bill am i
as of this moment you are six years old
call me when you get in
bill have i gone crazy bill
you are my girl are not you
that i am
then you are crazy
when  when are you coming back
you in a hurry
a big hurry be quick about it  so good night darling and sleep tight
wait a minute you cannot hang up you have not even said it
bill you know how much i do  but over the phone now really that is kid stuff
sure like the western union boys used to do
and who remembered it who was there on the dot at twelve midnight
the reading could have been better but you said it  now many happy returns of the day
many happy returns of the day
i get a party do not i
of course birthday and welcome home who will i ask
it is no secret i know all about the party  eve wrote me
she did
how is eve okay
i will check with eve
see you
it will not play
cut it out
this is my house not a theater in my house you are a guest not a director
you have heard it about when i looked through the wrong end of a camera finder
remind me to tell you about when i looked into the heart of an artichoke
i thought you were going to be late
when i am guest of honor
i had no idea you were even here
i ran into eve on my way upstairs she told me you were dressing
that never stopped you before
well we started talking she wanted to know all about hollywood she seemed so interested
she is a girl of so many interests
it is a pretty rare quality these days
she is a girl of so many rare qualities
so she seems
clyde fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time
i have always denied the legend that you were in 'our american cousing the night lincoln was shot
i do not think that is funny
thirty minutes forty minutes what of it
for instance  you
nothing really
the kid  junior that is  will be right down unless you would like to take her drink up to her
i can always get a fresh one karen  you are a gibson girl
you know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural
that is all over
the audition
eve  how enchanting  wherever did you get the idea of having eve read with miss caswell
you would not understand  how was miss caswell
i would not be surprised sometimes you frighten me
poor little flower just dropped her petals and folded her tent
do not mix your metaphors
i mix what i like
okay mix
i am nothing but a body with a voice no mind
what a body what a voice
the exship news' reporter no body no voice all mind
the gong rang the fight's over calm down
i will not calm down
do not calm down
you are being terribly tolerant are not you
i am trying terribly hard
well you need not i will not be tolerated and i will not be plotted against
here we go
tell that to dr freud along with the rest of it
i have been aware of that for some time
well i am
i will say
do not be condescending
come on get up i will buy you a drink
the terms are too high unconditional surrender
just being happy just stopping all this nonsense about eve  and eve and me
it is not nonsense
but if i tell you it is  as i just did were you listening to me  is not that enough
i wish it were
then what would be enough  if we were married
i would not want you to marry me just to prove something
you have had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me margo tell me that is behind all this
i  i do not know bill just a feeling i do not know
that suddenly makes the whole thing believable
hear hear
you were great
glory hallelujah
i will marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all
pass me the empty bottle i may find her why look there's rasputin
what would you like texas
you know what i am going to be
a cowboy
a married lady
with the paper to prove it
eve eve harrington
i told you a lie we will make it easily margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut
just wondered what
why you have to go out there
i do not have to i want to
is it the money
eighty percent of it will go for taxes
then why why if you are the best and most successful young director in the theater
it is only one picture deal
so few come back
yeah they keep you under drugs out there with armed guards
also addison dewitt
every day
you did not have to tell me
of course not
goodbye mr sampson
i will admit i was worried when max called i had my doubts
you should not have had any doubts
i am talking about you and what you want
so am i
what have i got to do with it
from what would i be running
you are always after truth  on the stage what about off
i am for it
then face it i have since that first night  here  in the dressing room
when i told you what every young actress should know
when you told me that whatever i became it would be because of you
your makeup's a little heavy
 and for you
you are quite a girl
you think
i am in love with margo had not you heard
you hear all kinds of things
i am only human rumors to the contrary and i am as curious as the next man
find out
only thing what i go after i want to go after i do not want it to come after me
no thanks birdie
i know she just keeps hearing her dead father play the banjo
but she just got here
she is on her way with half the men in the joint  it is only a fur coat
what did you expect  live sables
a diamond collar gold sleeves  you know picture people
they can always grab oranges off trees this you cannot do in times square
i never played fort sumter
buy some
the same size
of course
well i guess a real tight girdle help when you are playing a lunatic
oh brother
oh brother
miss coonan
if i have not i will find something till you are normal
imagine all this admiration in just one room
see you home
something maybe grew a size bigger
just because you cannot even work a zipper it was very thoughtful eve and i appreciate it
behind in your dues how much
i have not got a union i am slave labor
do you want an argument or an answer
an answer
now you want an argument
she works hard
night ang day
she is loyal and efficient
like an agent with one client
she thinks only for me   does not she
well let's say she thinks only about you anyway
how do you mean that
my back's open  did the extra help get here
there's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers who would you call  the william morris agency
you are not being funny i could get actors for less what about the food
the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres  voila
that french ventriloquist taught you a lot did not he
do not be dense the party
i ai not dense and he is been here twenty minutes
well i certainly think it is odd he has not even come up
miss harrington
what are you doing here
i  i guess i fell asleep
how did you get in here
that is all
what for
you probably will not believe me
probably not
it was for my report
what report to whom
ours was one of the first erasmus hall i am the president
erasmus hall that is in brooklyn is not it
lots of actresses come from brooklyn barbara stanwyck susan hayward  of course they are just movie stars
that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper
i will just pick up the broken glass
do not bother
with changing and everything a little over an hour
i do not care if i never get home
you rest i will get it
why should you think i would not be
not at all
i have seen you so often  it took every bit of courage i could raise
to speak to just a playwright's wife i am the lowest form of celebrity
he is the best
oh no
she is got to meet you
no i would be imposing on her i would be just another tonguetied gushing fan
but if i would known maybe some other time i mean looking like this
you look just fine   by the way that is your name
eve eve harrington
not at all  margo this is eve harrington
my husband
it could not possibly interest you
i will be at the old stand tomorrow matinee
not just that way as a friend
i would like that
some hollywood movie star her plane got in late
discouraging is not it women with furs like that where it never gets cold
i think she would cheer
but mr richards and mr sampson
they will do as they are told
of course
you will not forget it
i will not forget
i seem to be forever thanking you for something do not i
but there must be some reason something i have done without knowing
the reason is margo and do not try to figure it out einstein could not
if i thought i would offended her of all people
no eve i will not forget
do not bother i can take it up myself
mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all
they certainly do not waste much time
nothing definite yet  it is just to have lunch
do not get up  and do not act as if i were the queen mother
i do not expect you to be pleasant
i do not intend to be
cannot we sit down just for a minute
there cannot be very much
oh but there is
 and easy or not i will not believe a word
why should not you  please sit down
no i do not expect you to believe anything except that the responsibility is mine and the disgrace
let's not get overdramatic
i am not crying
tell me how did your lunch turn out  with the man from hollywood
some vague promises of a test that is all  if a particular part should come along one of those things
but the raves about your performance
 an understudy's performance
he can help you
i wish i would never met him i would like him to be dead i want my friends back
something most important you can do
you want to play cora you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it
if you told him so he would give me the part he said he would
after all you have said do not you know the part was written for margo
it could have been  fifteen years ago it is my part now
you talk just as addison said you did
cora is my part you have got to tell lloyd it is for me
i do not think anything in the world could make me say that
over my dead body
i would do much more  for a part that good
but not all of it  not that lloyd and i are going to be married
thank you karen
how do you do mr richards
every performance then  am i safe in assuming you like it
i would like anything miss channing played
there was an item in the times i like the title 'footsteps on the ceiling'
let's get back to this one have you really seen every performance  why i am curious
i hope so mr richards good night
i was dreadful miss channing believe me  i have no right to be anyone's understudy much less yours
there are other plays
not with you in them not by mr richards
the four of you must have so much to say to each other  with mr sampson leaving
i will not be a minute
i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time
you certainly can especially if you are me between now and tomorrow morning
well you have done so much that is new
the curtains i made them myself
they are lovely are not they lovely birdie
do not bother mrs brown will be along for it in a minute
no trouble at all
very becoming it looks better on you than it did on me
i have got it
 and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man
right here
it seems i cannot think of a thing you have not thought of
that is my job  see you at tea time
eve   by any chance did you place a call from me to bill for midnight california time
oh golly and i forgot to tell you
yes dear you forgot all about it
i am sorry i did not mean to
i would not like
thank you eve i would like a martini  very dry
i had no idea you knew each other
really eve why
well if you would been here to begin with i would not have dared to read at all
why not
 and if you would come in the middle i would have stopped i could not have gone on
what a pity all that fire and music being turned off
i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny 'aged in wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play
they are your fans your audience
you have what
she is just outside the door
the heaveho
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you would seen the play
i am so happy you are happy
peace and quit is for libraries
roughly ten minutes
how far to the station
three or four miles
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas
none in sight there are not many along this back road
not many car either not much chance of a lift
it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down
be brave he will come back  with or without gas
it does not matter
i detest cheap sentiment
we have all seemed a little tense lately
so many people  know me i wish i did i wish someone would tell be about me
you are margo just  margo
what about bill
he is in love with you
those years stretch as the years go on i have seen it happen too often
not to you not to bill
is not that what they always say
about what
this i cannot tell you how sorry i am
with tears
but not right away first the business of fighting them off chin up stout fella
you will be there will not you
up to here that is where i have got it  up to here of all the star ridden presumptuous hysterical
margo again
and again and again two hours late for the audition to begin with
that is on time for margo
then a childish heavyhanded routine about not knowing eve was her understudy
it is just possible she did not
 everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about until his play becomes a vehicle for miss channing
margo has not done badly by it
what is
we are driving out to the country tomorrow night just the four of us bill margo you and i
fivefiftyfive we will be at the station in plenty of time
just a little skid that is all this road's like glass
she wanted to explain about her interview wanted to apologize to someone  and did not dare face margo
i wonder why
that is quite a change of subject
if we could cast it properly that is
maybe get some younger actress for the part someone who would look the part as well as play it
you have got to admit it would be a novelty
now you are quoting addison or eve
no i got the idea myself  while she was talking to me
with gestures of course
for once to write something and have it realized completely for once not to compromise
now just a minute
it strikes me that eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious
that bitter cynicism of yours is something you have acquired since you left radcliffe
the cynicism you refer to i acquired the day i discovered i was different from little boys
margo in the cub room i could not be more surprised if she would said grant's tomb
i am glad bill's back
they would die without each other
what are you going to wear
i have no possible interest in anything she would have to say
nothing much she apologized
not much
did miss harrington tell you to call mr richards
old wives' tales born of envy and jealousy and a phobia against truth
i doubt very much that you would like her in 'the hairy ape'
 among so many quiet qualities
what is he talking about
where is she
up in the room
too many and you have got a new guest a movie star from hollywood
shucks and my autograph book is at the cleaners
not exactly sometimes though i wish i understood you better
when you do let me in on it
i will
the play all right i guess
cora she is  still a girl of twenty
twentyish it is not important
do not you think it is about time it became important
how do you mean
do not be evasive
margo you have not got any age
miss channing is ageless spoken like a press agent
i know what i am talking about after all they are my plays
eve eve my understudy but i had no idea
i thought you knew she was put on over a week ago
you would have been proud of her
i am sure
she was a revelation
to you too
what do you mean
 in this case apparently as trustworthy as the world almanac
you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most
i have no intention of having an accident
it is not important whether you do we are wearing long underwear
the audience will want its money refunded believe me
thank you lloyd godspeed
too bad
city hall that is for prize fighters and reporters  i see a cathedral a bishop banks of flowers
you know she probably means well after all
she is a louse
i mean really deeply angry
i do not think i could be
well i do not want to play cora
call what call
it this templeton 89970 miss margo channing
that is right but i do not understand
we are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight california time to mr william sampson in beverly hills
i placed
go ahead please
play it again
but that was the fourth straight time
then this will be five i suppose you think i am too drunk to count
no you are just crazy about liebestraum
i ai not gonna die not with a hit
poor max heartburn  it is that miss caswell i do not know why she does not give addison heartburn

oh do not  everyone says that
right away  are you sure you would not like something soft ryan
you are an interior decorator right
sally did all this herself
yeah we are in a constant state of flux  i see you have moved up from the soft stuff
no you are not
well yes  yes in fact  a little on the outside yes  and there's been all this friction
very well put
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort
and you know he really does not
and ryan works at home
well that is what ryan thought  i was more generous actually
alright  please do not tell ryan i am drinking
scout's honor
i will be your best friend
we are way past inappropriate
i will treasure this
i do not think so  i feel  i feel a bit funny
let's go for a walk

i am a little in the puke zone
you are never too old for a lolly  i am having one
i think he is really angry with me too
it is really not the same thing  he was really nicer when he drank
i am sorry
eight years though  that is quite an accomplishment

how would you make out on the twenty seventh floor
great look  have you seen the music man
you mean tonight

all right that is wonderful it is the majestic  44th street
meet you in the lobby okay
what cold and after the show we could go out on the town   i have been taking from arthur murray
so i see
a couple of months ago i looked up your card in the group insurance file
thank you  i thought you were avoiding me
what gave you that idea
i do not blame you it was unforgivable
i forgive you
you should not
i should not drink when i am driving
you are so right
why not  they seem friendly enough
nothing  there are just too many people here
no  i like it
really you mean you would not be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this
of course not
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side   is that better
much better
i understand christmas  family and all that 
i would better get back to my elevator i do not want to be fired
you do not think it is tilted a little too much 
the mirror  it is broken
i know i like it this way  makes me look the way i feel
oh  yes  just a minute  if you do not mind  this is sort of personal
all right have a nice christmas
oh yes  office party  miss olsen 
miss kubelik    you should not be out of bed
i did not know  i had no idea this was your apartment 
let me help you
what kind of talk is that  so you got a little over emotional  but you are fine now
my head  it feels like a big wad of chewing gum what time is it
two o'clock
where is my dress i have to go home
you do not want me here 
sure i do it is always nice to have company for christmas
i just want to go brush my teeth 
oh  of course i think there's a new toothbrush somewhere
no  i do not want anything
i will fix you some coffee
my sister  she will want to know what happened to me
wait a minute  let's talk this over first  just what are you going to tell her
well i have not figured it out exactly
you better figure it out  exactly suppose she asks you why you did not come home last night
i will tell her i spent the night with a friend
and where are you now
in his apartment
his apartment
i mean  her apartment
that is your friend's name
as soon as i can walk
something wrong with your legs

that is right will you see that mr sheldrake gets it
i am not very good at it
i am let me get the cards
you do not have to entertain me
give what up
why do people have to love people anyway
yeah  i know what you mean  queen
i do not want it
pick a card
a bad insurance risk
was he really upset when you told him
mr sheldrake oh yes very
maybe he does love me  only he does not have the nerve to tell his wife
i am sure that is the explanation
you really think so
no doubt about it
can i have that pad and the pencil
what for
i am going to write a letter to mrs sheldrake
you are
as one woman to another  i am sure she will understand 
miss kubelik i do not think that is such a good idea
well for one thing you cannot spell and secondly  if you did something like that  you would hate yourself
i do not like myself very much anyway
pick up your cards and let's go
do i have to
you bet i got a terrific hand
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne like some
would you mind opening the window
i just want some fresh air
it is only one story down  the best you can do is break a leg
so they will shoot me  like a horse
please miss kubelik you got to promise me you will not do anything foolish
who would care
i would
why cannot i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you
yeah well  that is the way it crumbles cookiewise go to sleep
for me
 mr sheldrake

holy shit  robert rath wants to know my name
how long have you been freelance
two years  two long fucking years
sounds like chickenshit 
after those cops you will never be able to come back to cleveland
we go around once
i knew the same way in ten years you are going to know
what does that fucking mean
all right bain  pay attention because this is where everything changes
that is right
shit  that sure is a lot of money
oh yeah
what i just said no assassin would say  what i have said only a mark would say
you would be
you do not know a fucking thing about me  you do not have the slightest fucking clue
why do not you tell me
you are too late
they money will be standard bank transfer  we believe we will know where and when
i do not give a fuck what you are  i asked you 
do you want rath or not
yes sir
yes  this is the hotel paraiso
no the other hotel paraiso in the city  near the plaza del sol
sick  the flu
i do not believe you
i am worried about you robert
know what
the fucking contract  how in the fuck did he know
i know  it was a joke
freelancer  a woman  surveillance specialist
the contract
paid in full
fuck you fuck cleveland and fuck your contracts 
i bet you fucking know
it cost us
he stole another contract
robert  robert
we have an mo her system is protected by her 'pussy virus'
um five
one hour per man
where are we going
what  how did you know i had a cat
took a guess  lucky for you i guessed right
who the fuck are you  who do you work for
i work for the government
i am part of the game just like you
what do you mean 'that is all' what in the hell do you know
the bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars
ten million 
now you understand why i am here
turn off the engine
you are the computer hacker you tell me
you did not know anything about me
until a minute ago
what does that mean
if i still was what i used to be you would not be pointing that at me
another contractor
someone hired both of you
he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him
he wants to kill you
and you want to use me to get him
we do not have a choice
i do not need you to get the money  my money
if it had not been for me you would be dead
if you walk out that door bain will still come after you
you do not know that  you are trying to scare me
rath  robert rath
no  just electra
if bain had not taken the contract on me would you have
this is crazy  i cannot trust you you cannot trust me  how can we possibly help each other
it is not the same is it
better than playing with yourself
he was killed
where you wanted to be
the same way everyone does the government the agency
the cia
more or less
how old were you
they recruited me when i was in high school
jesus  why
languages  i was already fluent in nine languages
you were like a boy genius
some people said that  i never thought so
why not
i was just different
you went from high school to the agency
no  i graduated from george washington university  then i entered the agency training program
they did not give you a choice did they
no they did not
but you knew what they were training you for
of course  i was going to be james bond
the exotic women
women  no not really
why not
women i do not i do not want to talk about women
why did you leave the agency
yes  it did not matter much to them as long as i disappeared
then you went freelance
my first take
it was mechanical  very precise it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline
are they usually like that
no  just the first one
after that
they become complicated messy
did it ever bother you
did it ever bother james bond
that is fiction
no  something honest
you said you did not trust it
i do not
i do not know
you were there
it helps me to focus  it centers me helps me think
oh  what do you think about
work  the things i need to get done
i do not know maybe i will live on a boat sail to all the places i have never been
that sounds nice
you can have the bed  the chair is fine for me
i do not know but i am sure he is not sleeping
book  sunglasses  great
the beach  it was nice
thank you
i have always wanted to learn something like that
you should  it is very important that the body release the energy that builds in it
transmits and receives
cheap as shit
they saw you coming a mile away  if i had known we would be using 
it is too late now  okay  we will have to deal with these
then we wait
aiiee  more waiting  i do not know if i like this plan
that means you will not have a gun
that is right
you will have the money  how do i know that you will not 
i will be walking out of the bank unarmed  you will have the gun and i will drive the car
we split the money
five million apiece  you get on your plane i get on mine
sounds pretty well figured out
i have been thinking about it for a long time
i told you he will
you cannot know for sure how can you  i mean you are not him
i was
for nicholai
i do not know  it just happened  i was here ten years ago i am here now  that is it
i do not believe that
he wanted what i want now to get out of the business  to disappear to some empty greek island
what did he say
he said i could not win  that no one wins at this game
was that it
then he offered me one million dollars to walk away to quit the business
you did not take it
no  i went back to the hotel  and waited
ten years later here you are again
yes  here i am again
five million dollars will buy a lot of rolaids
i hate bishops  they are useless  i like knights
they are worth less points
i did not notice them
when i first saw them i thought they were married
how do you know they are not
i went into their room this afternoon
jesus if someone had 
nobody ever sees me
why in the hell would you take that chance
i know  it makes me crazy
so i could watch the girl that lived under me
apparently this doctor was unable to cure you
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of selfpreservation
did he explain how this happened
i am playing white remember  you cannot tell me which pieces to move it does not work that way
i am sure you will
am i attractive
is it a physical thing or a mental thing
i did not want to complicate the situation
attraction is a complication
it can be
it happened to you before
someone like me like you  a pro
what happened to her
she was taken
did you 
no  i tried to stop it  i could not
was she the only one
after her i realized that to survive i had to live without it is dangerous to let things become complicated
is this becoming complicated
i am not sure that i care anymore
maybe you should see a psychiatrist
i am not normal
oh god  i see it
god damnit electra  this is not a game  this is business
right  in my hands i have five backup disks he made of all of his work last night
jesus  why did not you tell me
i will make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus
yes  please come in
how can a beautiful man like you be shy
i would love one  whatever you are having
holidays are our busiest days  no one likes to be alone on holidays i know i do not
i think you are supposed to answer that question
i called because i just want i need to talk
everyone regrets something
but when you finlsh a job afterwards do you think about them
no  they call me i do not call them  if they did not call i would not exist
all the time
can you tell me about it
do you believe that
are you asking me if i believe in another life
just a little ways  up to those trees
it is possible
you are pretty famous are not you
i hope not
one hundred thousand  that is it jesus is that a lot
that is exactly what i told myself
that is what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that
go ahead
what do other guys do
do they get down on their knees begging and crying
you mean quit
that is correct
how would you like the funds
american currency
this will take some time
i have all day
i am sorry but i am waiting for an associate  can you hold everything for me until he arrives
of course senor
thank you
and pay for their drinks occasionally
a coke if they have it
hey doug you want a beer
naz draviwhat do you like about this place these people chris
i do not know it is kind of underground doug's right there's too much crap in this town
it will not last believe me and you when will you go back to the states
i do not know maybe i will enrol for postgrad' studies next autumn
like you
no better than me you know i have many friends you should meet more of them
that is that a democrat with an attitude
yeah group bloody therapy time
son of the american ambassador and a banker  good enough
wanker more like what does he know about writing
no you do not get it every cabby in town knows this joint so where is the mystery the danger
and not even then sometimes
we are only jokingit is your round though
well this place is too expensive so you have had it
you are outnumbered kat two to one got to go with the majority that is democracy
yeah let's check out the lowlife
no just crap i want some picture frames
never heard of kmart
yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints
just because they have got a choice of four mcdonalds does not mean they can afford a cheeseburger
give'em a break doug all it takes is a little work
what did the beer cost
fifteen crowns
this place is getting expensive too used to be twelve
still fifty cents ai not bad
an alternative literary venue
i ai not sure poetry will go down too well here
no it is the whole idea behind it how did they get this place
squatted it
right and not just the bar lubosh and his mates took the whole freaking building
so doug well there's tons of empty buildings  why do not we get one
you have got to stop using that word we it is getting kind of scary right katka
maybe but someone's got to make a stand
like custer huh
no if's or but's it is a cinch do you want to know what the icing is
it is big right jahn
we could make a run for it
no thanks i think we ought to get going though
you got my word on it
great let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow catch you later partner
yeah that could be job number two i think it is a sewer
he was an electrician
no he was talking about girls i think
that makes you an expert i guess
do not worry i will give you a hand as soon as i can
sureas for the crap i have got an idea
yeah you are in luck there's two of them the other's in there
i will drill the locks and replace the barrels that way it will not cost so much
a locksmith too why d'you ever bother with writing
tell them we are working for the university
thought of everything have not you
yep except a name for this place
you are nuts man katka's right
no just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment that is all
well do not get carried away
i will try not to i will leave that to you anyway there's still plenty more of it
good i love swinging a shovel
'cause you stink of booze
yeah that was honza's idea i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear
tough break
nope not even close i have thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though
really the freeman centre
nothe asylum
oh yeah that is my connection to that
none it is mine  you said it earlier i am nuts
i have been saying that since we met
just save me a little patch and i will do it later
can you do the lock on it
no it is welded uplet's take a look from the inside
but how did the wall get here
i do not know this wall is not like the rest though it is not all that old either
do not we have enough already
it must be fair old size suppose it is empty
and suppose a little old lady lives there
no way it is sealed  if she is in there she is dead
sounds like a good reason to leave it alone
just think though it would make a hell of a cafe that way we keep the auditorium clear
why how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe
i will rig up something do not worry  do you think i could bash through with that little hammer
i do not know doug we have not even got the place together and already you want to extend it
do not worry if the old lady's there i will brick it back up
is it gone fourthirty
yeah i will take some
see if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls give it a bit of atmosphere
you would be better off with tables and chairs
we got a party tomorrow night cannot have the place smelling like shit
have you ever stolen anything
like helping a sick kid
no for the asylum
that is that five instead of ten years jail
they will never get us
we are going to need it all
jesus doug they will execute us
stealing's stealing we might as well get what we need this will do for the floor and the walkway too
not yet we need a few lengths of scaffold
why do not we just take the whole damn building brick by brick doug
we do not speak czech
no not if you have got better things to do
who put a bee up your butt
when your ready son

you should have said it was bringabottle
no beer

well  i think you might consider
i just wanted to distract them i was not trying to get a picture of you
look i appreciate what you did for me but this is my job and i am keeping those pictures
all right i will develop the photos anything i do not want is yours
how do i know you will not keep them all
i will take you with me
 where are you taking me
quite a while i took the scenic route
well i have certainly enjoyed it  that is that
better it is not on the market yet
it does not protect your head though
that is why i wear a target on my chest
exploring in the woods many years ago  i was a solitary child
i loathe bats
so did i once but i kept coming back and i guess i became the thing i feared most
photo database i will do your photos now
if you do not mind my asking who's close to you
you could have killed him you know you could have killed the joker
i had to save you vicki i    please trust me
bruce wayne   i have read your work  i quite like it
great  give me a grant
i might consider it if you introduce me to miss vale
you are just back from corto maltese  i saw your combat photos  quite a departure for you
i want you to hang up the suit and i want you to stay away from vicki
i cannot do that not while the joker's still at large
then stay away from vicki that is all i want man i just want your word
because i   because she would never speak to me again
yeah a drink 'civilized' right
alfred bring something for mr knox  i will have one too
as far as i know
good  with any luck we will run into each other
too much work  i am not really the physical type  thank you alfred
odd desire for anyone
well bruce some types are a little more obvious than others
in other words what right do i have to talk about terror
as much as i do  it is not that  i do not want to be depressing that is all
i see  if i know how you really feel i will not like you as much
i will take you home if you would like
god  you would  come on bruce  i just want to get two drinks in you  as an experiment
maybe we should just kiss
 we could try that
i said i would call you the minute i got free  and i did  and here we are
mmhmm  lunch  not even dinner
 looks like a convention
yes bruce  i am here 
i am sorry i had to stand you up today i would like to make it up to you
well bruce  i do not think  that would be possible
i realize the way things have gone between us   i wish you would reconsider
i wish you would
 i know it is you bruce i am not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it
who's this 'bruce' are you trying to make me jealous
i am serious bruce we have to  
i do not understand it you can do so much good for people as bruce wayne
you are one man you cannot save everybody
what if i could save a handful  what if i could save one
sometimes i do not know if there's enough of me left to save
very thoughtful do not touch it
i feel naked without it
the does it it is going to be this weekend
 where are you calling from
finding out where she is
how can you do that if she is already off the line
i have had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum
what now
hang on i have to leave a message
in all these years why could not i see how it wold turn out
ohhhh you do not mean that
i do not but i do it is just i love you bruce i do not want you to
vicki do you love half of me or all of me
he will be ready when you do remember what happened at the apartment
all right bruce what do you suggest
i suggest a nice big bomb
good a bomb on a blind tip from bruce wayne  we do have laws
then for god's sake harvey cancel the anniversary celebration
we have told him we will deal what could he possible have to gain by 
do you still think the joker cares about money
i do not know i am just a da i do not have access to all you expert sources
take 'em i want his head
they will be sorry they will be sorry move out
it is a detour they are backed up for blocks
sorry  we had another bat sighting
do not let your job interfere with your business   someone's been talking to harvey dent
eckhardt our problems are your problems
why eckhardt  you should be thinking about the future
about how pretty you are pretty boy  maybe he would like to know 
what are you scared of heights
i dunno man  after what happened to johnny gobs  
look johnny gobs got ripped and walked off a roof all right  no big loss
that ai not what i heard  that ai not what i heard at all  i heard the bat got him
gimme a break will you  shut up
five stories straight down there was no blood in the body
no shit  it was all over the pavement
god  how old are you  there ai not no bat
no wonder you are such a chickenshit  now shut up  there ai not no bat
do you want this money or do not you  now shut up  shut up 
very good idea jack  in fact    i would like you to handle this operation personally
because i want someone i can trust
oh jack   do not forget your lucky deck
jack  thank god  i cannot believe it is you  i heard you would been 
is that what you heard
jack  jack  do i look like a jack
ha  that is the best part i cannot
i have considered that possibility
and what happens if we say no
nobody wants a war carmine  if we cannot do business we shake hands and part friends
that is it
that is it
goddammit i expect to be treated like and artist get off my screen
unfortunate but i think we can work around it
a visual record yes  a beforeand after kind of thing  this could make your reputation
 behind the makeup
strong stomach huh  i like that in a woman  maybe we can do business after all
alicia  come here have a seat  show miss vale why you wear the mask
what  i improved her a little
miss vale was it something i said  do you want to sniff my flower

too much glamor huh  that is in the bag   monte carlo  apes in kenya
a girl could get killed   so they tell me  that is new and hot in gotham city
oh it is too good  we got a sixfoot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers

listen you have to  finish me off you do not want me coming back
no we can treat the wounds 
i know  just be quick about it will you do it right
how can you be out here
i dabble in pharmaceuticals medical research we have developed a type of sunblocker using octyl salicylate a few others things
watch me
take him
it is because i am human that i can do this
you are blind 
there are other ways to see sit
i did not come here to get my palms read i need something translated
show me
who is lamagra
the vampire god this speaks of his return
yes the vampire apocalypse it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst
how do i stop it
but i just got here 
you have been here longer than you think
i am sorry i 
you are joking 
what happens then
not anymore you have seen one of them you will not be allowed to live after that
do it you will be dead before you can file the complaint
that is ridiculous no one's that powerful
figured they would send someone after you thought i would wait around and see who showed up
you used me as bait
it worked did not it
but he could have 
he did not get over it
he is a familiar a human who works for the vampires see this mark
because they are vampire wannabes if they are loyal if they prove themselves then their masters will turn them
and that is a good thing
for some live forever never get old the ultimate high
preventive medicine
it is war now get the fuck out of the way
you do not know that
what do you see here
the way they move they way they smell 
there are worse things than vampires out there
like what
like me
some kind of archive 
is not this all a little hightech i thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins
nothing that will not heal by dawn
serum  it is a human hemoglobin substitute
you get used to the darkness
those are not real memories no one has that kind of recall
for your miracle cure
your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card
some it is been slow 
you do not look so good
i am just tired that is all we have been up all night
you make it sound like i am already dead
i have been better 
how long have we been driving
i do not know i woke up just before you did 
we get out of this alive maybe i will take that miracle cure of yours
what are you talking about
i am not leaving without you
you do not understand the thirst 
i know take some of my blood
yes you will the human side of you is stronger i know it is
for them but for me 
you are a week early
i was in the neighborhood
i was afraid that might happen

georgie oh man hold the mayo
fuck yeah  i never seen nothing like it  i am fucking wasted
that is right
cheer up man  half this money is ours we are fucking rich
you know he is got a point  we are fucking americans  we stick out like sore thumbs
do not be such a pussy
fine charlie  you familiar with the marsh case
i am sorry man  but i ai not ever heard of no brother dying from getting too much pussy
you have got to get me something i can use charlie
i am trying
you got something on the coke
no  but i got something
right now  guess who's been buying coke from him for the last five and half years
joe koehler  i know him  he is an estate attorney  and he is very expensive
what would joanne braslow need with an estate attorney  she was not even mentioned in marsh's will
what good does that do  it is the old will
you think the da's gonna file on joanne
i do not know
thanks mister d
i just wanted to introduce myself and inform miss lawson that there will be an inquiry
an inquiry into what
for starters i would like to know why she left the house and did not report the death
that is the best part  she gets it all  everything
the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest
the official cause
that is what my report will read
but there's more
can we put rebecca lawson at the scene
a massive cardiac arrest
what was mr marsh's physical condition prior to his death
very poor  he was suffering from severe arterial disease
was the heart attack the result of natural causes
we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood
so mr marsh used cocaine
i do not think so  the membrane in his nasal passage did not show any sign of long time usage
then how did it get into his body
yes  those of mr marsh and a thumb print of miss lawsongs
dr mccurdy what would cocaine do to someone in mr marsh's condition
increase his heart rate
 and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine
it would be an added stress to his heart
what would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to mr marsh and then induced him to make love
it would be the same as shooting a gun at him
thank you doctor mccurdy  your witness
like cats and dogs
what did they argue about
no  never
your witness
why did not the state's investigation uncover mr roston earlier
he was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago
alright  i am going to allow his testimony
did miss lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving
you may call your next witness
counsel approach the bench
sit down frank
take your pole out of the water frank  the fish ai not biting today
you are bluffing  john it is me remember  i have known you since your name was juan carlos
why would she want that
are not they all
yeah  well  we will let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that
i was just about to make my point your honor
your honor  please
hey  the bell's sounded  it is between rounds
i did not hear it
really  what does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning
you have been following me
her  it is an obvious move  i am building a case against her remember
the state's investigation just uncovered mr roston yesterday afternoon in chicago
objection  mr rostongs sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial
your honor i am trying to establish a pattern in dr paley's behavior with women
you get his statement
i have
did you use it the night marsh died
no  i have not done it in years
a little after eleven
why did you come by
i had some papers to pick up
do you know who mr marsh was with
i assume his girlfriend
rebecca lawson
you would not know her address would you
no  but i can get it for you
thank you
six years
did you ever see mr marsh use cocaine
no  never
what about miss lawson
i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial
did you see mr marsh the day before his death
horrible  he was tired and pale
did you talk about miss lawson
his secretary  joanne braslow
she was here
no  she stopped by to pick up some papers
show me
about a year and half ago
did mr marsh change his lifestyle after that
yes  he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly
he did everything he could to take care of his heart
doctor steven trammel  cardiologist
we were lovers
how long were you together
for about one year
how would you describe your sex life with miss lawson
i had a bad heart
i had bypass surgery
and how are you now
fine  the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man
how did your relationship with miss lawson progress after the surgery
it did not
why not
she left me
she did not  she just left
why do you think she left you
well  i think that after the operation she realized that
it was like she was trying to push me as far as she could  she called it opening new doors
can you give the court an example
what would she do that made it hard to resist
she said she was going to fuck me like i have never been fucked before
i woke up the next morning and she was gone
did you change your will while you were with miss lawson
she was
thank you  the state rests
at a dinner party  about eight months ago
did you ever see her again after that
yes  several times
what eventually happened to your relationship with miss lawson
we stopped seeing each other
yes  insulin and others
what did she say
we had dinner at a restaurant
and the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not
i was angry
i suggest it never happened
no further questions
that is all dr paley
that is enough
no  no i do not
oriental medicine
and is miss lawson a patient of yours
yes  i have been seeing her for over a year
why does she come to you
she suffers from severe menstrual cramps
chinese peony root
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like
it is a white powder that comes in a vial
then  those are not your own words
i am a nurse  i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital  dr paley's on staff there
what was the nature of your relationship with dr paley
we dated for about a month last year
then what happened
yes  he did
he laughed  and basically said he would decide when it was over
do you remember his exact words
there was an inquiry  it was his word against mine  they believed him  i was fired
what changed
yes  cocaine
what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial
do you remember the date when you saw miss lawson in the bathroom
he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him  that his heart could not take it
so the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving  that must cause tremendous anxiety sleepless nights  incredible stress
i suppose
well think about it  is not it possible
yes  i suppose it is possible
he video taped you
that bastard
i thought he was a kind gentle man
you do not like miss lawson much do you
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money  that must have made you pretty angry
dristan nasal spray
would you read for us the time of the purchase
three fifteen
am  or pm
no  why would i want to kill him
because he called me
frank  what are you doing here
i need to ask you a question  what made you get in touch with joanne braslow
you know i cannot talk about that
i am not asking for names or specifics  i just want to know what prompted you to make the call
i do not know  that is why i am asking you
you still have not answered my question
something like that
we are not animals
i thought the subject was sex
as it pertains to you  not me  did you always know you had different tastes
why not
because  it is beyond intellect it is emotion  it is passion  it has to be experienced  it cannot be imagined
because  somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it
sure  where to
i know
because i am your attorney  i should not be going to your house
is it against the law
no  it just does not look right
i think the photographer's probably a voyeur
i am the photographer
oh  well they are different
that is not an answer
it is not my taste
tastes can change
hi frank
i just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow
yes  she did
great  i will see you at the office at nine
no  not at the office  i have got a better idea
i hardly know him  he wanted me and he could not have me
no  i wanted to be a professional hockey player
i broke my ankle skating  that ended that dream
it is hard to let go of a dream is not it  to let go of what you want
what would
you and me  making love
is that what you think i was thinking
no  that is what i know you were thinking
you take a lot for granted
she is mistaken
that is not good enough goddamit
it is not true  you have to believe me
why would she lie
i do not know frank  but do not you think that is something we should find out
i went out on the boat
it is only the beginning
you can see me now
paley could be a problem tomorrow
i am glad you have such confidence in me
do not worry about paley  he cannot touch me  no one can  i have thought it all out
what does that mean  you have been thinking about the case  or you thought everything out before you killed marsh
tonight we open new doors
are you scared
to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today
rebecca  we shattered a mangs life in open court
fuck him  he tried to shatter mine
he was only doing what he thought was right
i do need you  no matter what you think of me  i did not do it
no  you are not
no  i am a survivor
that is crazy
do not push me frank  i might lose my temper and send it out just for spite
raymond i am the only criminal attorney you have
she is waiting in the conference room
the kids at school say she humped mr marsh to death
hey you know better than that  what did i teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something
she allegedly humped him to death
is mom yelling at you too
i love you too dad
 but it is sunday
i know what day it is  get off the phone
i gotta go  i will call you later
discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities  who told you to say that
that is it mr dulaney  take a seat
mr cardenas i suggest you move on to another line of questioning
mr roston
how often do you use cocaine
i can back it up
you better  please answer the question
i am relaxing
this is not relaxing
if you want me to
i am always open to learning new things
no  it has to be done by tomorrow
i know  what can i do  he is the boss
he could let you have your vacation
some example you set
he must have something or he would not be pressing so hard
if he files are you going to take the case
i do not know yet  i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow
that is she like
attractive  bright  distant charming when she wants to be
yeah  but can she cook
why do not you talk to him now
because i go to trial in seven weeks i have got a lot of preparing to do
no one's asking you not to work  i just think you could make some time for your son
yeah  fine  excuse me  i will be right back
we have to talk
that is wrong
that is what i was hoping you would tell me
where have you been
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you  you were with her were not you
because i knew you would think exactly what you are thinking
i am not
you are sleeping with her are not you
maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael
talk to me
we cannot pretend this is not happening
please  not now
why did not you come to me
i do not know
you used to like to touch me  to make love to me
it is more involved than that
it was a place to start
you think that is the answer  sex is that what you want  you want me to make love to you
is this what you want  huh  is it
that is too bad
no it is not  now i get to pitch
michael you should not be happy when someone else is not feeling well
not even if they are a dork
not even if they are a dork  you should go by and see how he is feeling

i will not let him  he belongs to me now  bye sweetie
that is all we need  better let me drive
this is my conversation  i will say what i fucking please
wake up  make a right at ocean avenue  the hotel's a few blocks up on the left
oh  seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise
i am not  fuck you  theo's a genius
i will explain later  i am sort of on hold
you could have made me lose my call
so what  what could be important enough to put your hands on me
i did not hurt you
you could not hurt me  but it is the principle
me he will not stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching
i am trying to help somebody okay
theo wants to talk again
did you have to tell her my name
this mercedes of yours that is it look like
then whose is it
you gotta just look the other way
i am sorry  you will do all right without me  keep my share
you could have killed us
it was the fugitive in the chrysler that caused this  we were trying to overtake him
no reason to kill innocent bystanders  shit  i cannot hardly move my neck
we have already got an ambulance on the way  do not try to get out
i am not staying in here with him puking all over the place  get this door open
i got to get going  an agent is showing me a house up on broad beach in ten minutes
they will wait  meantime raise the lid
why would i do that
i am going to level with you officer
see for yourself federal agent us treasury  on the job
you got it wrong  i am the one that is on your side
you almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you are on my side  you stupid fuck
yes sir
or relieve me of it later
only i was sloppy  i let you take me out  that was quite a humiliation
any time you decide to let me in on it
bear right till the fire road ends  it is not far
mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation
look i have got a wife  i do not care if either of you ever get caught
what else did you expect him to say  do it theo  or give me the gun
with all those holes nels pumped in i knew you would not suffocate
you can tell she was really worried about me
put those away  we cannot have marks on his wrists
you never miss a trick
i will see that he stays calm  pack the money up and put it in the trunk
it is taken care of
wait  i hear her breathing now there she just picked it up again
will you relax  this in no way affects our business  go on
that is what i deserve for listening in the first place
just like they say no fucking self control
if you know that just back off
shit  there's the hotel  you overshot the driveway
and stop with the directions
make a u and go back
go ahead then  i am covering the receiver  she cannot hear
satisfied wiseass
in any event whatever occurs you do not belt anybody
what do you keep making me out to be
sure  and they record your voice  and later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder that is out
i am doing fine  theo wants to deal
what am i supposed to do
we will toss it when we make the blind curve
allow me
there's a taxi stand here  i can meet you
any minute
i was worried about you  both of you
we have had our share of fuckups but it is going to work out fine
give me 20 minutes at least
i have been trying to get someone  anyone  for hours 
if this is some sales pitch i am not buying 
you do not understand
and what are you whispering for
i cannot talk any louder  they might hear
you may be our only chance  i do not know if i can do this again
what would you do  just pick my number out of the air
they smashed the phone  i have been clicking the loose wires together hoping it would make a connection
who smashed the phone
they are holding my husband downstairs
sure  and they left you upstairs to make phone calls
you are not doing anything to me  because  listen to this carefully  i do not care
i do not believe you
you are the one who's not to be believed
my name is 
i do not want to know 
my name is lenore oberfeld
do not expect me to tell you who i am
i realize you do not want to be involved
i am not involved  keep clicking your little wires  you will get someone else  good luck
you will not disconnect
oh will not i
because you know you will be killing us
do not lay this on me
then hang up  do it
no  nothing
one of them uisu a cop
what makes you say that
oh man  these people mean business
then they took the mercedes away  with his body in it
listen there's an overpass coming up  i may lose you for a minute
i am in traffic  there's no place to turn
rachel  they are going after rachel now  and i cannot stop them
stop throwing names at me
rachel my daughter  she is an honor student at parker  my god she is only nine
what do they need her for
they know jack will give them what they want once they have her
bottom line  there's nothing i can do for you but tip the cops
let me call the school  tell them not to let her go
they do not know you  they will not listen
26th off wilshire
even if i got there first she would not go with me
she would if she heard my voice on the phone
just hang on  i have got a life of my own
another minute
what about the others
i kind of dropped them off  they were getting on my nerves
what are you doing now
what do you think i am doing  i am on my way to the school like you wanted
forget about us  just save rachel
tell me what she looks like
how much time do you have left on it
i do not know  80 or 90 minutes tops
why did not you do what your friends wanted and just  get rid of me
hey drop it okay
i did not mean to open up any old wounds
i sure as hell got my wish  she does not exist  so maybe you reached the appropriate person after all
i am sorry if i caused you to lose your business deal
well you did
sometimes i paint
our house always needs touching up
they say my work is somewhat derivative
lady you do not have to keep up a running commentary
i am afraid if i stop talking i will lose you  just name any reasonable amount and it is yours
a price on everything
i was not always like that  i do not think i was
i am about ten blocks from the school
i have no right to ask for help i have never thought of anybody but myself
that makes two of us
you are breaking up  i cannot hear you  theo
i have lost you  you are gone  i cannot hear anything
i am making my turn  i see the school up ahead
i can hear you again clearly
great  stay with me  there must be a hundred kids out here
that is not her
she is gone 
do not say anything  do not alarm them  just go
i am trying to
it is not your fault theo  you tried
i should have put them out of the car and come sooner
when jack sees they have got rachel he will tell them what they want to know
the one in brentwood
what bank
the city national on san vincente
what do you mean
black mercedes 600s
even if you found us  what then
do not say that
do you know that is in that box
i am not supposed to  but i do millions in cash and bearer bonds
jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago
they have still got to be able to sign his name
it is not hard to do  i do it all the time
i am pretty good at signatures myself
to hide it from the irs
how come everybody turns out to be a crook
do not talk  do not talk
that is going on
the front door slammed  someone went out  there's a different car starting
theo i want you to know you are probably the most decent man i have ever met
yeah sure that is me  ask anybody
but i guess we have not really met  have we
i have got a lot of respect for you too  for the way you feel about your family
because you are probably the last person i will ever talk to
you cannot give up
yes  i think so  another crossed line
or somebody else there is listening in 
downstairs  there must be an extension  oh my god 
do not panic  i might be wrong  hello  i guess i was wrong
try what you did before  it worked before  i will not talk anymore
hi lenore  it is me  i got you back  courtesy of star 69  are you hurt
they dragged me downstairs  i thought they were going to kill me
lucky for them they did not
what did you do
i had a little encounter at the bank and our mr transplant ended up under the wheels of a chevy
god if he does not come back 
are you okay
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles
that is coming off  how about the girl
yes sir
put the man back on
she is next  in two or three more minutes she will be free
i cannot do it
do not start thinking about it  is the tape off
yes  but i want rachel to come with me
they will not allow that  it is one at a time  and you have to be first
why cannot it be her
once you are in the car with me she is sure to come to us
i am sorry  you have thought this out better than i ever could  i am ready now
just start walking  come on walk to me
shit  i am sorry
she will be with you soon  they are pulling up  they will realize i kept my part of the bargain
she will never be the same  none of us will
include me in that
why did not you just shoot them
because a lot of people would have gotten killed  probably all the wrong ones
you are going to let them get away with this
we have almost got your husband and your daughter out  so do not get any ideas
they tortured us  and you are going to let them have all that money
so far they are keeping their part of it
they put their hands all over me
somehow i got along better with you on the phone  it is all there is not it
why are you telling him that  are you crazy
the rest of the money is here in the car  why do not you come and get it
there is not any such person
whose money is this
it belongs to the man you took it from  or should i saw ustoleu it from
the guy with the transplant
jack oberfeld in person  did you kill him
damned if i know
the video cameras will put you with him in the bank and i will bet there were enough witnesses
at least one
plus they will remember you going after his daughter at school
you timed that beautifully
they always pick rachel up early on thursday
i got what i fucking deserved  i had it all  i could have kept going
as they say  no good deed goes unpunished
and all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop 
i thought it was inspired
there was unou cop involved  oh shit  fuck
why pick me to be your mark
nobody's easier to con than a con man
you knew about me
there's no way out for you  you have to deal with us
assure them that you are being well treated
he seems to think he is entitled to it all
absolutely  and topanga canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if i recall
he seems to be headed for topanga
i am not trying to lose them  nor am i exceeding any speed limits
the one thing you do not want is to attract the police
granted the cops are not an alternative  certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk
i do not hear him moving around anymore
that is that supposed to me
i knew you were a loser the first night i laid eyes on you
you i would have noticed
naturally you did not learn your lesson
i guess i ought to stop seeing woman as victims
you could have hit me
only in the leg or the thigh you would live but you just would not wear shorts
you would not 
inform him the fee is seventyfive large for your return  all parts intact
he wants 75 back
let me talk to him  hold the phone to my ear  but do not nudge me
ask them
that is why we are turning off onto a fire road
some people fall apart in a pinch but you shine
i cannot hear  now there's a siren  they must be in an ambulance  what about the money  nels
wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed
the money nels  
i was sentenced to a youth camp out here when i was fourteen  we cleared some of these same roads
they did some great job of reforming you
why are we stopping
sooner or later you will learn to trust me
how about later
the cop in the trunk  he could still be alive
that is a reasonable possibility
he might have heard everything we said in the car
that is your point
we cannot leave him to repeat anything
which one of us is elected to do the deed
you are the man with the gun
only one way to find out
that is how it is going to be
he let the fucking cop out  but he will not 
nothing but cds in there  i thought maybe you would like some celine or whitney
took preparation
exactly who was this oberfeld
local lawyer for dominican dealers  off to buy a half interest in a mall in granada hills on their behalf
take your hand out of there slowly
you will not live to see it
it is going to be some fucking snowstorm
pull over  pull over someplace
toss them  one at a time  i do not want to lose count
turns out you did me a favor you are looking at a rich man
i do not want it
i told you  sooner or later you would have to trust me 
who is this
you must not hang up
did not we play this scene before
do not leave me here to die  theo please  you cannot let me die 
i am afraid i have used up all my good deeds for the day
i am self employed  what kind of cut did the hairy one have
twenty percent
fine  i want half  plus the release of the family
whatever you say
you are up on your details are not you
there are no guarantees in this life
granted  but i do not believe they are grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures
it is a nice day  how about the beach
what time frame have you got in mind
it should take me twenty minutes where are you coming from
we can be there
there's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass
tell the lady to relax  tell her i cannot wait to meet her in person
she is somewhat damaged in the shipping  but nothing makeup will not cover
got a phone in that van
you are getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular
i wish it had never been invented
we do not see you
i am three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand
stay there
i do not want you within two hundred feet  park down by the lifeguard station  nobody gets out
it is your call
fucking a it is  any argument and i am out of here
just relax
i do not need to relax  the woman put her on
you will see her
i do not want to see her later  i want to hear her unowu
talk to the man
i do not know what you mean
i still do not see you
my pleasure 
and not a nickel
i will not let 'em
that is how it is  you see her approaching you toss out installment one
i am tying it up in a bundle now where is she
she is yours  what are we waiting on
i am backing up
do not worry
put the girl on
what are you planning to do when they got here  they will kill us they will kill rachel
better reassure him
call me nels
i think i have already had a quickie  thank you
and if you ditch us we get zilch
sure i end up with some cash and a lot of bonds i do not know how to dispose of
the fuck i will
there's two police cars now
then you can sue the cops collect from both ends  tighten your belts  here it comes  ready
you could not be calling at a worse time nels
who's this
i thought you would know me by now
what does it take to kill you
i suppose you are in your taxi
why would she want me to think you were on ice
intelligent question nels  i believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity
that bitch  that is keeping you from taking off
my compensation  somebody still owes me  big time
you could always disappear with that is already in your backpack
take the 405 south
five minutes
where do i turn
and make ourselves a hell of a target
we are gonna get there first
how do you know
believe me  they could not be busier at the moment
i have got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards
where is the backpack
stay put  i know my way around
them  they will not be expecting us
brilliant  unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away  in which case you just warned them
nobody can do anything right but you
following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend
only you udo notu have a flat
seems not
if you were not going for a spare what were you doing
something was rattling around some loose tools
mind if i have a look
was i picking on you  how come you pulled in back of this fruitstand
tell the truth i was going to take a much needed leak
let me talk to the lady again
there's no lady here
if her kid or her old man have been harmed we have also got nothing to talk about
let her tell you

do you remember telling me once that all through my career i would never fit in  well
you were right of course  but after
years of thinking the matter over i began to see that the whole thing was not really my problem
do you think i have not seen the bodies of those
men every time i have closed my eyes  but after you went away i
went away 
went away  i like that
almost quaint

a man named tim ma
it could be a cover i suppose

there's nothing going on out there docexcept maybe the occasional fly fisherman
try this one out some
my secret
yeah  ten months we have been fishing this river together  we use the same equipment more or less
but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as i do
 no that is not possible mason  the trout 
is a perfect hunter
he is brains without ambition
sensitivity without neurosis  he is
the master of his realm
how can we ever hope to win against the trout
there's only one way you can do it mason
turn the power of the hunter against him
tie a fly
create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive
forcing him to strike  and only then does our noble friend realize that the preycan bite
without caution
is death
some people might say you are reading an awful lot in
to a simple thing like
 or it will ignite 
cold  cold  how cold
never let it reach fifty degredegrees
and what if it does
everything will die mason
 the only one who understands what this me
mmeans mason  
trying to remember something somebody once told me about tying a fly
and only then does our noble friend realize
that the prey can bite back
let me have those
well  costello's finished with the stability profile but abbott is still chewing on the load file
so reaction temperature is fifty degrees
well your prediction was on the nose
how much longer for the range and power projections

land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week

but that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months
if that is what it says
can i check one of these volumes out
sir this is not a lending library it is the hall of records
well then how about a ruler
a ruler
the print's pretty fine i forgot my glasses i would like to be able to read across
yes sir that is what it looks like i will give you that
it is why you attract a client like my daughter
no she happens to think the last one was murdered
i think i gave it to her
tell me what do the police say
they are calling it an accident
who's the investigating officer
lou escobar  he is a lieutenant
do you know him
oh yes
where from
we worked in chinatown together
would you call him a capable man
of course but you have got no reason to think he is bungled the case
too bad
you may think you know what you are dealing with but believe me you do not
it is what the da used to tell me about chinatown
was he right
mainly that you are rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers
yes his girlfriend
you mean the little chippie he was with at the el macando
yes she is disappeared has not she
no she is probably scared to death
would not it be useful to talk to her
you did not see mulwray much did you
my daughter
what about her
if you want to hire me i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about
well she is an extremely jealous person i did not want her to find out about the girl

i have still got a few teeth in my head mr gittes and a few friends in town
i will look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves
avocado groves

an obituary column can you read in this light
yes i think i can manage
that you killed hollis mulwray
hollie was always fond of tidepools you know what he used to say about them
have not the faintest idea
just incorporate the valley into the city so the water goes to la after all it is very simple
i have no idea how much do you want
i want to know what you are worth over ten million
oh my yes
you have got her where
do you remember the figures we discussed
of course i do where are you

i am sorry mrs mulwray
lou she will kill you let her go for now you do not know
gittes stay outta this
take it easy take it easy it was an accident
an accident
jake you are very disturbed you are crazy that is her father

but there is no possibility he would have taken his own life
certainly not
a private investigator
mr gittes
well yes
what are you having
iced tea
yeah fine thank you
actually he is not and he is moved from his apartment at the el macando
that is not his apartment
mr gittes you have talked me into it i will drop the lawsuit
mrs mulwray
yes mr gittes
i do not want to drop it
why what on earth for  look hollis seems to think you are an innocent man
well i have been accused of many things mrs mulwray but never that
may i speak frankly mrs mulwray
you may if you can mr gittes
nothing personal mrs mulwray i just 
it is very personal it could not be more personal is this a business or an obsession with you
looks like you went quite a distance
please call first
just a minute
you left your keys in the ignition
oh thank you
yes as i said i was very grateful
well how much would you like
stop it the money's fine it is generous but you have shortchanged me on the story
i have
i think so something besides your husband's death was bothering you you were upset but not that upset
mr gittes  do not tell me how i feel
if your husband was killed it was  this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence
but he was not killed
how did you find out
my husband
he told you
i was grateful
she is cheating on him
did you have affairs
mr gittes
did he know
where you were when your husband died
i cannot tell you
you mean you do not know where you were
i mean i cannot tell you
you were seeing someone too
that your maiden name
yes why
no reason
no i am just a snoop
you seem to have had a reason for every other question
no not for that one
i do not believe you
been meaning to talk to you about that
maybe putting your nose in other people's business
more like other people putting their business in my nose
another satisfied client's wife
wait a minute sonny  i think you better come with me
what for there's nothing more to say  get my car please
money how they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs that i do not know
yes of course it was quite a while after i was just out of grade school when they did that
so you married your father's business partner
no yes a little you see hollis and my fa my father had a falling out
over the water department or over you
not over me why would they have a falling out over me
then it was over the water department
yes he never forgave him for it
never forgave him for what
for talking him into building it he never forgave my father they have not spoken to this day
you sure shout that
of course i am sure
what about you do you and your father get along
what dam
everything you can see everything around us i was at the hall of records today  that bother you
know him
no i think i would remember
it is why he was killed jasper lamar crabb jasper lamar crabb
what what is it
there was a memorial service at the mar vista inn today for jasper lamar crabb he died three weeks ago
is that unusual
two weeks ago he bought those 25000 acres that is unusual
they cannot be
they may not know it but they are
get in the car
i gave everybody the night off
easy it is an innocent question
no question from you is innocent mr gittes
i guess not to you mrs mulwray frankly you really saved my a my neck tonight
that is that mrs mulwray
when was the last time
what were you doing there
working for the district attorney
doing what
the district attorney gives his men advice like that
they do in chinatown
bothers everybody who works there but to me it was
you cannot always tell that is going on there
no why was it
i thought i was keeping someone from being hurt and actually i ended up making sure they were hurt
could you do anything about it
your eye
what about it
there's something black in the green part of your eye
oh that it is a flaw in the iris
a flaw
yes sort of a birthmark
and i want to know where
please do not be angry believe me it is got nothing to do with you
where are you going
it has to do with my father
i know
he owns it you know
i saw him
you saw my fa father when
this morning
you did not tell me
there has not been a lot of time
that you were jealous and he was worried about what you might do
do to who
mulwray's girlfriend for one thing he wanted to know where she was
you may think you know that is going on but you do not
that is what your father said you are telling me he is in back of this whole thing
it is possible
including the death of your husband
you bastard
it is either that or you drive to the police yourself
the police
c'mon mrs mulwray you have got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there
she is not tied up
you know what i mean you are keeping her there against her will
i am not
then let's go talk to her
what about
what does it look like
like she knows about hollis' death like she knows more than you want her to tell
you are insane
i will if you do not
because of hollis because she was seeing your husband was that it jesus christ say something was that it
are not you coming back with me
do not worry i am not telling anybody about this
that is not what i meant
where is the girl
upstairs why
i want to see her
she is having a bath now why do you want to see her
yes we have got a 430 train to catch why
what are you doing that is wrong i told you we have got a 430
you know any good criminal lawyers
what the hell is this all about
yes positively that is where he was drowned
what are you saying
she is my daughter
she is my sister
she is my sister and my daughter

you cannot go by train escobar will be looking for you everywhere
how about a plane
that is worse just get out of here walk out leave everything
i have to go home and get my things
i will take care of it
where can we go
where does kyo live
with us
on his day off get the exact address
he did not wear bifocals
i am all right

he is in the dark room
but mr gittes
three reservoirs mengs room of a richfield gas station on flower and the pig 'n whistle
jesus christ this guy's really got water on the brain
what would you expect that is his job
listen we cannot string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something
i think i got something
oh yeah you pick up the watch
oh yes we have are you alone mr gittes
is not everybody what can i do for you miss sessions
when did you come in
i was the one who pretended to be mrs mulwray remember
oh no
why do not you give me your address and we can talk this over
no mr gittes just look in the obituary column of today's times
the obituary column
you will find one of those people
'those people' miss sessions
a miss sessions calling
do not know her take a number
nothing to do with dad it is me actually
perhaps if we could meet your father
there's just one question
of course
do you accept anyone of the jewish persuasion
do not be sorry neither does dad wanted to make sure though did not we honey
oh good
i wonder is it too late for us to have a look around
i do not think so be happy to show you
would you mind if we took a stroll on our own
just if you will confine yourself to the main building it is nearly bedtime
we understand c'mon sweetheart
jj gittes and it is not a departmental matter
i wonder if you would care to wait in my office
he never even kids about it
maybe he takes it very seriously
i am sorry i 
well tell him i will be back
help yourself
hope so he is working for us
yeah must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances
oh yes hollis was the best department head the city's ever had my goodness what happened to your nose
i cut myself shaving
you ought to be more careful that must really smart
only when i breathe
only when you breathe do not tell me you are still working for mrs mulwray
i never was
i do not understand
neither do i actually but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me
mr gittes you are not making a bit of sense
i said the northwest valley
that is like saying they are in arizona
mr gittes my field men are out and i cannot give you an exact location
well i think i i would have remembered
have we ever met
well no

y'know yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting
i am not going to faint but if i want to faint i will faint okay
okay but if you do i will have to perform resuscitation
which could maybe what
maybe lead to a flare up
a flare up
flare up of old emotions

glad to have you david  how is the new office
still settling in really  where is dr arroway
tell me
last week about 3 am fish  dr fisher  was on a late shift and he found her doing laundry
i am not  you are far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense 
two  there's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you would be wasting your time
then disagree but do not stand in my way
no thanks
oh  how is he doing
very well since my appointment he is been made interim director
really  congratulations by the way
i am surprised you even knew it was an election year
'president's science advisor'  so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now
now exactly  it is complicated
no doubt
it is not like you have given me much choice
the point is this is not just scientific inquiry anymore  it is turned into some kind of personal obsession
goddamnit they are out there david 
you must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already
rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise
what  why
apparently he is genuinely interested in science  this could be a chance to win him over
we have cracked it  lunacharsky found it
you mean 
you were right ellie  you were right all along
actually i am running late 
it will just take a moment
this seemed best
right  well
good luck david
nothing  i guess i just wanted to thank you
thank you
for giving me a chance just for a moment to feel what it must be like to be you
it could be anything  the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica
how soon will you be able to decode it
analyzing signal polarization shifts
a third layer
maybe it will be at the end of the data when the message recycles
how can that be
been there done that got the tshirt
vb10's an m dwarf signa draconis too old
i am not sure  you mind checking right ascension 18 hours 34 minutes declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes
put it on speakers
i scanned it at arecibo negative results always
norad's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops shuttle endeavor's in sleep mode
kent kent for chrissakes  you must be eleanor
ellie  pulsar
191921  found a glitch in the timing probably a starquake
nice  where
this is how you see the sky
never seen the optical sky myself but i hear it is nice too
thank you mr sensitive  i am coming at this wrong missing something something
it cannot be coming from vega the system's too young
it is a civilian facility
it is incredibly rich  we have been cataloging it in frames or 'pages' right now we are on 10413
you want to classify prime numbers
you do not seem to understand that it is your interests i am trying to protect  
and a hundred mile airspace
and a hundred mile airspace
i do not have an official response michael  all i have are the same questions you have
in fact by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible
by our standards yes
is it possible  yes  but 
thank you doctor  now 
 but i do not believe it to be the truth
i cannot move any smaller
try again between the static and 'hey jude' that is where they are hiding
but what do i say
just be yourself captain  find out where he is
on that old shortwave  maybe on a clear night  come on now under the covers
could we hear to the moon
big enough radio i do not see why not
could we hear god
mmm that is a good one  maybe his echo  okay no more stalling
okay okay there
dad but tell me how did i mean how can
that is my scientist
so  are you an hallucination  or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin
am i artifact or dream  you might ask that about anything
originally just another species like yourselves  well not like you at all actually but
can you show me
small moves captain small moves
why did you contact us
you contacted us  we were simply listening  we have been listening for millions of years
and those other docking ports i saw i mean there are others
many others
and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built
we do not know  whoever they were they were gone long before we ever got here
the scale it is just  so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here
not all  some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams  some never make it this far
so we passed some kind of test
the librarian or the library
so  what happens now
now you go home
no  i mean why so soon
but  other people from our planet should see what i have seen  they should witness this for themselves
that is not the way it works
but you said you wanted to help  do not you see what it would mean
no more stalling captain
no  please
childhood is over ellie  it is time to grow up
the infamous unfashionable bluntness  you are here so we can do business i want to make a deal
what kind of deal
that is my girl  lights
not if you think like a vegan
it is so small
japanese squid fleet  they use lights to attract them to the surface then turn them into sushi
yes  a shame  still it would be worse if they died for nothing
what are you talking about  it is over
i think whoever sent the message did it because they are worried about us
the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us
would not you if you saw hitler on tv  come i want to show you something
the systems integration site
mmm  look closer
that is what they all say
peter valerian
sounds like a russian general
' is indistinguishable from magic'
it is almost there  the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time
what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico
the vla
thirtyone linked dishes  you could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here
 i am moving to washington
but what about your research  
you too
it is really happening
that you valerian
like it or not
like it  almost there
i am  i am fine
it is all right the important thing is you are safe 
peter what are you talking about what malfunction  what day is this
what day
how long was i gone
make that two
and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you
i guess i would have felt sorry for the universe
spoken like a true believer
what about you  does not all of this shake your faith at all
how do you mean
well it is been a while but i do not recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations
'my father's house has many mansions'
that is not faith it is physics  the second law of thermodynamics
and mind yes  what are you 
so if i let the pendulum go when it swings back you would not flinch
only a tiny bit  even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt
i never knew my mother  my father died when i was nine
did you love him
yes  very much
prove it
some of my best friends are scientists
i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors
some of my best friends are scientists  they are saying the machine is alive
not exactly  it has organic qualities but we do not really understand how they are integrated with the mechanical systems
maybe you are creating a monster
i do not think so
in other words
if you came back you would only be four years older  but over 50 years would have passed on earth
something like that
and everybody you care about would be dead and buried
you are willing to die for this
it is what my whole life's been aimed at the only thing that is given it a sense of purpose
what would you think
i do not follow
i do not know  but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility
what are you so afraid of ellie
how do you mean
i remember  you were indelicate indiscreet and entirely less than tactful sound like anyone you know
the final countdown
oh  i brought you something
i do seem to be maybe because i am just a little bit terrified about tomorrow
maybe that is okay
what is it
i am sorry  i cannot 
what are you so afraid of
please palmer  if you care for me at all do not push this now 
what are my other options  in fifty years  never
do not you understand  i just have to hold it together  just until tomorrow 
and then what  then you will be safe
 i do not know 
ellie there is no reason you have to be alone
it was quite a page turner
pretty ironic huh  i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy just to find you
i am not sure it is come to that
they do not believe me
i do
ellie you are the proof  you tell them your story  ultimately they will have no choice but to believe you
in other words
i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed  basically announcing our intentions are hostile
it is designed purely as a defensive device  call it a reasonable precaution
what is it
in the private aircraft hangar anybody could have walked in
did you come
no what about your camera girl did she come
we were interrupted i had to go back to the set
thank you
i will listen for you buzzing over
yes from wendel to celebrate the license approval for our aircharter firm i forgot to tell you
well yes  you are getting out of bed tomorrow they want you to walk
he was a chemical engineer with a food company
outside in the visitors car park
what they brought the car here
my car not yours yours is a complete wreck the police dragged it to the pound behind the station
have you seen it
the sergeant asked me to identify it he did not believe you would gotten out alive
it is about time
it is
after being bombarded endlessly by road safety propaganda it is almost a relief to have found myself inan actual accident
i wish i had they bury the dead so quickly  they should leave them lying around for months
what about his wife the woman doctor have you visited her yet
no i could not i feel too close to her
i cannot sit on this balcony forever i am beginning to feel like a potted plant
how can you drive james your legs you can barely walk
is the traffic heavier now there seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident
i have never really noticed is renata going with you
i thought she might come along handling a car again might be more tiring than i imagine
i am amazed that she will let you drive her
you are not envious
do you find him attractive
he is very pale covered with scars
would you like to tuck him though in that car
no but when he is in that car
have you seen his penis
i think it is badly scarred too from a motorcycle accident
vaughan is not interested in pedestrians

look at all this traffic i am not sure i can deal with it
that is vaughan he talked to you at the hospital
i do not know you can never be sure with vaughan this is his show
yes i did not plan it that way
and did you fantasize that vaughan was photographing all these sex acts as though they were traffic accidents
yes  they felt like traffic accidents
i saw the blood it looks like motor oil
you were the last one i saw just before the accident do you remember we made love
are you still involving me in your crash
i can drive
i suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes you know jayne mansfield james dean albert camus
you are kidding
serious but you will have to take your new friend the female crashtest dummy she dropped it off for you
you are not jealous are you you have to understand helen and i had this strange intense experience together
hard to say
i am going to leave now do you want a lift
no thanks i will go with vaughan
i live in my car this is my workshop
it is something we are all intimately involved in the reshaping of the human body by modern technology
you could get your wish at any moment

i had heard something like this  describe it for me  the hit
i was wondering if you could tell me anything about a wildcat operative
to be sure  now tell how your friend died
our crow
your comprehension is not required  your cooperation and indeed your ability are the issues on the table
hello i just met amy and she pointed out where you live
i know how it is  my dad collects miniature canon
yes  she is a little odd i understand
but quite harmless i am sure
no i only let her go with edward  it is alright
it is one of the clearest memories i have twelfth nightburning pine and mummers' plays
what do you mean
you know what i wished daddy i wished i could be a good girl
i was not saying anything i was singing
i suppose any note no matter how sour is a song if you hold on to it long enough
the song i was trying to hum the song my friend taught me
oh you will remember it some time
did you ever make a wish
oh lots of times
did your wishes ever come true
that is what i wished on edward says it is a wishing ring  and it is
but where did you get it amy
at the old house with the voice
on the back street  a green house
the farren house
do you know the people
no dear i do not know them but i have heard about them
are they nice
i got my wish anyway
you must not tell anybody or it will not come true
but it is already come true
sh then you must keep it true goodnight darling
i had my breakfast while you were still asleep
it was right there on top is not she pretty
she was very pretty
that is her name
all right mommy
you cannot open it yet you have to put all of them under the tree until morning
all right amy  go tell edward to take you
i wonder if you do not resent that in her
she is not irena's child  there's nothing of irena in her she is my child
i am not a jealous woman oliver
i know that
darling no father could be nicer to a child than you are to amy
i forgot i had it on
it is early yet
it is nearly a quarter after four the party was for four was not it
yes darling
gosh in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them
times have changed
no kids yet  something's gone wrong maybe i ought to call somebody
all right ollie  go ahead call the boyds3000wsee if their darling donald has left
i think i should  3000w
that is right
what do you mean
i called not only the boyds but the irvings  neither of them received invitations
but they must have  amy and i made them out together  you mailed them did not you edward
amy's been lying again
well it seemed to me 
you are shouting at me
i am not shouting at you but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child
i thought amy was calling i guess not
i am sorry i was somewhere else he returns to the card game
well you know where it is
i suppose so
no she went running off to some old house she was talking about yesterday
that is the farren house
is that where she got the ring mrs reed she should not be up there
but i told her to go with you
your birthday amy   as she goes  and i have something for you in my locker a present
mommy's having a party for me i asked robert and donald and lois 
are you coming to see us miss callahan
no darling i had not intended to
i live right here
maybe i will drop in and see your mommy
you will see it when it is all lit and ready for you
yes daddy
did you mail then
yes i did
where did you mail them
i will show you
yes daddy
but amy that was just a story it was not real  that tree's no mailbox
but wishes do not come true
certain wishes do
but you told me in the garden that the wish about the tree could not come true
but this is different  go on blow
i wanted to talk to you  i wanted to tell you about the other children
cannot you tell me later
but i did not play with them daddy  they would not play with me
it was on account of the birthday party
why did not you run after them
i did  i came to an old dark house and a voice called to me  a lovely sweet voice 
it is true
and who did the voice belong to
it was just a voice
let me be the judge of that
voices from an old dark house
you are upset about me  i made you fight i hate for you to fight
this one says to mother from amy
and this one's for mrs farren
she gave me a ring so i am giving her a ring i paid twentyfive cents for it too
this one has not got a name on it who's this one for amy
why daddy you know my friend too
because she is my friend
she is there whenever i call her
where amy where do you see her
do not you see herright there under the tree
but irena is in the garden she is right there under the tree
but there's no one here darling
she is upstairs the lady who lives up there
tell me tha real truth you can see my friend cannot you
i do not know yet
my goodness do not you open your presents until christmas morning
well i guess we are not a very proper family
you called me by my name
irena but who are you
i am your friend
i have wanted a friend
i have wanted a friend too i have been lonely
but where do you come from
you would not understand i come from great darkness and deep peace
but where is that
i can not tell you
will you be friend for always
for as long as you will let me
i shall want you for always
for always then only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
not even daddyor mommy
no this must be a friendship that only we shall have you and i amy and her friend
oh i like the sound of that amy and her friend amy and her friend
whenever you want
i will just never learn arithmetic
but you must
the numbers simply do not mean anything
oh yes they do  look  one is like a tall princess
a princess
of course and two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee
yes yes i see prince
that is right
this is more fun than just pretend
of course
that one's an elm
light shining in her eyes throw sea weeds into the flames and the fire turns blue
but we do not have any sea weed
pretend darling  it is all soul's eve  round about the fire we go  over the flames we leapt
my dolls we can pretend
yes winter's coming  i do not like the winter
oh thank you amy
you can open it now i guess lois huggins says that is proper
it reminded me of you so i bought it it cost me more than all the others
i shall wear it in my hair
oh please
a merry christmas to you amy
you wanted to share this moment with me
it stands so still
because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind
i can sea its breath in the cold
it is wildness and freedom no one can touch it
i want to touch it
do not cry amy
but she is dead
amy listen to me death is not such a terrible thing
oh it is it is death's terrible
but amy  amyi am dead
but why
mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away
that is a finelooking ring
a lady threw it to me
most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl
it is a pretty ring
i would not be surprised if it were a true wishing ring
i am trying to
let me take another look at that ring
will you come soon
soon as i finish
i do suppose so but if you were there yesterday guess you can get there today
that means i can go alone
but mrs farren just started to tell me a story please
but she is such a nice lady
but i saw what it was it is the little deer
but what happened to the little deer
probably hit by a car hard to see things in the twilight
why is it just lying there why does not it get up
because it cannot it is dead
but it was alive  it was fast and strong
it got hit
but where has it gone  where is all the strength and the quickness
the ring we will have no more nonsense about the ring
no thank you
then i will tell you a story  a lovely story do you know the story of rapunzel
mommy read it to ne
do you know the story of the headless horseman
why has not he got a head
a christmas present it is been so long since i have had a christmas present
do not you read shakespeare
yes yes 
my daughter died long ago
anybody could know that song
gray they were a lovely lovely gray
and my eyesmy eyes are gray look you see
yesyes that is true
and my hairwhat color hair did barbara have
it was palea shadowed gold
yes barbara barbara
good nightbarbara
now i do not know amy 
that is from her  that woman
wait a minute listen
such a brief visit but dear child it has made my christmas very merry
yes everything's all right edward
and amy mailed them
she pleaded so to do it
so do i mr reed
good heavens what could you be giving me little miss
no amy slapped donald because he had hurt the butterfly  and it was her friend
well that seems a harmless fancy 
amy has too many fancies  too few friends it worries me it does not seem normal
perhaps she is wanted for understanding
that many women in one place  nothing good can come from that
sorry about frida she is been friends with jen forever
i do not believe in pms women made it up just so they can be bitchy
can we get some service here
jennifer gave her a makeover
looks like a helluva lot more than a makeover was there surgery involved
sorry do not mean to be wolfing down i am just starving
i have changed a lot lately
yeah yeah i know smoking kills i will quit someday does not it seem like all the cool people smoke
yul brynner they are all dead
yeah but they looked cool
i have been working out
i mean body temperature do you have a fever
never felt better
at victoria's secret
i mean where on your body
oh on my wrist
no it was another woman
good except for pms
it is hard to describe i get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and
that is just part of being a woman diet and exercise should help avoid salt sugar starches caffeine alcohol
what else is there
nearly four
how have you been feeling
what does that have to do with me
you have not mentioned dating anyone since mark and well you are not a lesbian are you
no i am not a lesbian geez mom
it is okay if you are we just want to know i do not want to be expecting grandchildren if
come on we have been double dating since the fourth grade
yeah even then look what happened michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me
well that is not going to happen tonight george said carltongs a nice guy
translation a total geek
anything's better than mark
my shrink says he is not so bad
so do not look in his eyes
people notice you frida
maybe he is just shy
my date always pays more attention to you than to me
frida i do not mean this as a criticism but you might not want to talk about pms around men
sorry it is just so bad lately you are so lucky you never get pms
i get a little bloated sometimes
i would kill for just a little bloated
only to see
cannot you get contacts
no it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye
try to get through dinner without them you have beautiful eyes
or if your boyfriend's an asshole
frida grab that red one
and she got the medium
even on sale that stuff's a fortune i worked all week to pay for a bra
i kind of asked him to we were you know he got a little carried away
are you kidding he might as well say can i date rape you
i never thought of it like that i never know what to do on dates do guys still pay
i do not see anything maybe just a little
holy shit i am a freak
oh my glasses maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them
there you go blaming yourself for everything again
and he was ripped limb from limb
i am sure they were exaggerating
why would they exaggerate
to sound like big macho cops he was probably just found with a knife in his back
did i kill him of course not
no did you fuck him
no i do not think so
you do not think so you either did or your did not
i ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with gregory
i guess you are off that vegetarian kick you have been on for ten years
i think i went in and fell asleep i guess gregory walked home and got killed i blacked out
at least your pms is over
and my bra finally fits again
my vision got worse again
no mark wears boxers they must have been in the dryer already
uh huh good thing those cops did not see that
rule one always wear makeup
i wonder if he is married
um he stopped by yesterday before you came over
why did not you tell me you said you had not seen him for a month
i am sorry i did not want you to think i was still a doormat
frida i am your friend i am not judging you you did not sleep with the creep did you
hmmm sounds suspicious
i do not know much about him how do you know if a guy is decent
give him the tampon test
what the hell is the tampon test
you have to stop being so self critical frida
i looked like an italian man
we almost slept together and then the hair started and i booked
great george is meeting carlton first for drinks we can meet and go together it will be a blast
well whatever it was seems to have worked cause you look great
you are just saying that
i think he called you beautiful
it is so hot in here
no you do not believe me
no they are not
it is just cause mine is finer a little bleach will fix that
i look like fucking chewbacca
there is a mangs arm in my bed
you fucked carlton see i told you he liked you
no not fucked him i think i killed him
i put it down the garbage disposal
and what makes you think you killed a man
maybe the blood was from your period like before
i have not gotten it yet
frida listen to yourself if i said i was a werewolf would you believe me
i do not know you have to take sammy he is afraid of me
i have been here what day is it
tuesday are you okay
shit i guess i missed work
frida carltongs dead
oh no
and he was missing an arm
oh my god jennifer i should go to confession
okay i gotta go
i am stopping by later i am worried about you bye
did you get rid of mark
i do not know i am spaced out he was taking a shower he must be still in there
he is been here all night
yeah i guess mark
i should call the police oh no peter peter is the police
do not call the police
why not there's been a murder
first of all you are my alibi i told george i was with you last night
what why would you do that
there's kind of this guy i am seeing
you are cheating on george jennifer how could you
you are right it is just i cannot cover up a murder so george will not know you are cheating
why the fuck would you do that
i could smell another woman on him
if you ask me the fucker got what he deserved i am glad he is dead
that is a terrible thing to say frida goes back to scrubbing the floor
you should have seen it erect
tell them you will meet them outside
hide him
well if he does he did not give you away he must really like you
does that mean this whole thing is over

these guys are not the kind that will take an apology they are the kind that will break my thumbs
you think that story's gonna make me loan you money
it is the truth if you would just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened
somehow this winds up being my fault you always blame me
come on i am your biggest supporter
my bra is my biggest supporter
on your desk
script coverage
on your desk
coffee and
your desk

yes that is what we are looking for
i think we should do something with strong female characters
i will make a note of that put the coverage on my desk
we he walked me home and we said goodnight um he kissed me goodnight and that was it
okay if you think of anything else please give us a call
are you following me
at least let me give you this back i washed it
i am trying to stay away from caffeine
okay well maybe some other time they continue walking together
so what book did you buy
oh it is nothing
no really i love knowing what people read
it is stupid
i can forgive you a bestseller
used to did it stop finally
no she died when i was twelve
i am sorry
i have had time to get over it she was killed by wolves they think
oh my god by wolves
the weird thing is i have had an odd morbid fascination with wolves ever since
yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line
thanks for the walk maybe we could get a bite sometime
yeah maybe
silver bullets a collectors item these are very valuable they were melted down from a crucifix
what are they for
oh just my wolf paraphernalia some people collect beanie babies i collect silver bullets
oh nothing's wrong just well do not you have your period
my period no
no i was doing my laundry
i am sorry  i am on edge today
no nope nothing in it
no i i checked when i put my stuff in i always look through the washer first
a man killed in central park
frida can we come in we need to talk to you it is important
uh the buzzer's broken i will be down in a second
it was not a date jennifer invited me along to dinner with them
mark would not hurt a fly
still have not figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off never seen anything like it
he was ripped to shreds also in his apartment
yeah sort of where is lloyd
i need to talk to you about us frida i can i carry your box
no i got it it is okay
what happened
yeah every guy you date winds up dead
that is that supposed to mean
did i tell you i have the worst sense of humor and i make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times
no but thanks for the warning
you cannot mean that i am sure your bark is worse than your bite
no my bite's a lot worse
like i had to say it no i wanted to say it
you did not say it
i love you too
they are for my cat i use them to train him not to rip up paper
you know i have never seen your cat
i loaned him to jennifer george moved out and she was lonely
they do oh no
no but i do not mind hairy are you okay
no do not come over peter i i do not want to see you anymore ever
what is there someone else
yes or no frida cannot you just be honest with me
you want the truth remember i tried to tell you something the other day
yes your pms frida i can deal with that
no you cannot it it gets so bad that i become a werewolf
i am not afraid frida i love you
peter i love you too but
i do not think you will hurt me
i do not think you would no matter what form you take
i cannot take that chance i could not live with myself if i did anything to you
i have the silver bullets in case i need to protect myself does that make you feel better
cannot you bite me and then i will be like you
no it does not work that way men cannot get pms unfortunately
i am staying here with you tonight there's no getting rid of me
maybe we should have children i do not think i would kill the father of my child
we can work this out other couples have worse problems
worse than this
no way can anything be proved all they have are some wolf hairs no one believes in werewolves
oh i see interesting theory
let's explore this what makes you feel you are a werewolf
and how did you feel when you ate this guy
i do not know i do not remember doing it
we did not have sex
you use the word fucking you are sexualizing things stop berating yourself it is okay to have sex
oh my god what happened
did he come home with you did you go to his apartment
no it was our first date
looks like it was your only date unless you go to his funeral
no i said it was our first date
no take it
yes jennifer told me what does that have to do with me
what makes you think i was the last one
you got a dog
no i have a cat
how big
packages of money
she is just insecure once you get to know her she is fabulous
she will talk about pms and stare at her salad
carlton insisted on leaving with her maybe he got lucky
so now being with frida is lucky i thought you said she was a flake
tell her i am eating
it is so bad she becomes a werewolf
take some allergy medicine
you cannot believe this bullshit
yeah sorry uh gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night
we are just trying to figure out what happened
we can just take this pillowcase
why would you want to be a cop
i do not know i guess the outfits are cool and i want a big gun
he is been running money for the mafia
you are some catch lloyd
torn apart limb from limb a bloody gruesome mess
i told you she was innocent
hey there was a lot of blood
she was never a suspect lloyd some animal must have done this
i checked all the zoos no missing animals you think a pitbull
waiting for dna tests he was hairier than madonna in penthouse
madonna's in penthouse
and he was missing an arm
we only live a few blocks apart
this is more than fishy this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead
okay lloyd you tell me how she killed them
you take the cake lloyd come on she is not here let's check out her psycho ex
the park dude was missing an arm
yeah okay i still say frida's involved she is the last one to see two dudes alive
she was not the last one to see them alive whoever killed them was
this one walk you home too
one of our only leads you had dates with both men right before they were killed
it is like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes
like a vampire or some shit
i know i followed you to the zoo to her house to your house
what the fuck are you following me for i am not a suspect here
what makes her think that
she says she is on the rag every time i get called in to investigate a murder
and that was 28 days ago today
did we get those dna tests back
just this morning animal hairs were found all over the victims
what kind of animal
looks like you need a haircut to me

carpe diem seize the day
very good mr_
we went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life anybody want to read
i did not know you taught
what was going on in the courtyard the other day
oh that that was an exercise to prove a point  about the evils of conformity
a barbaric yawp
a madman  perhaps he was  what kind of madman  do not think  answer
a crazy madman
use your imagination  first thing that pops to your mind even if it is gibberish
a a  sweatytoothed madman
now there's the poet speaking  close your eyes and think of the picture describe what you see  now
i i close my eyes  his image floats beside me
a sweatytoothed madman
a sweatytoothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain
excellent  have him act  give it rhythm
i have something
ah so you boy's have been snooping
i was just looking in an old annual and
nothing wrong with research
maybe they do not want worldly things distracting me from my teaching
then you are playing a part for him too are not you  a dangerously self destructive one
give your father the benefit of the doubt  talk to him  let him see who you are
is not there an easier way
not if you are going to stay true to yourself
it is not too bad  it is a tragedy why does she have to be in love with a jerk
you have another choice
why do not you read it to her it worked for nuwanda
she will not even see me pitts
nuwanda recited poetry to gloria and she jumped all over him right nuwanda
i do not know
what i have to do  screw the annual
listen anything's better than mystery meat
she is practically engaged to chet danburry  mr mondo jocko himself
i am calling her
screw it all  i do not give a damn about any of it
nothing  no mention of it
then you can help him
good luck
i am sorry neil

as far as i am concerned he will not have to know about any of it
come on that is impossible
horseshit  nothing's impossible
why do not you ask him first  maybe he will say yes
that is a laugh  if i do not ask at least i will not be disobeying him
but if he said no before then
i guess
what is that supposed to mean
being in the club means being stirred up by things  you look about as stirred up as a cesspool
you want me out  is that what you are saying
no i want you in  but being in means you gotta do something  not just say you are in
no  what do you mean 'no'

me too this is my favorite part of the tape
how true but i still feel i deserve more than you do of this treasure i mean i found it

i lugged it all over town
i made the polar bear pants
but i ate your mom's pie
i found that rock
it was a diamond and you swallowed it
i do not know who we are anymore
do you know what this means
maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it put it on
something about showing the world what principal collins has done
right she is so proud of her boyfriend
we never thanked him for giving us our special needs class
that is what jessica was talking about
she wants us to show the world what a great guy principal collins is
and like she said do it before the parade
that is it build him a float for the thanksgiving day parade
yes screw george washington just like marilyn monroe did
put a fork in me harry lets get started
harry are we gonna build this thing or not
lloyd what i am saying is we may already have what we want
principal collins is a greater american than george washington will ever be
yeah no more clicks and whistles now she speaks perfect english
you are a great teacher lloyd
roger that wilco
how could she miss this this whole salute to collins was her idea
he is so modest probably embarrassed by all the attention
well that is too bad this is his day
and with that complete loser
yeah we should never let a woman come between us again
i do not think that will happen we have learned a valuable lesson we will not ever forget
damn what are the odds
try one in a million
well what should we do
no lloyd chicks are for fags  i am not going to do it

i did not make a mistake every vote was there when you sac down
not wasting any time are you tracy
you know what they say about the early bird
yes i do
thanks mr m
i know
oh  there's one more thing about tracy i think you should know

here they are
you can put those in my box  i will look at them tomorrow
could you approve them now  i would like to kick off my campaign right away you know in the morning
are not you supposed to keep them
no that is fine
i thought you were supposed to keep them
okay fine sure
you bet
should be easy  so far no competition
good luck tracy
so like i was saying things were going pretty well in my life
calm down tracy  just calm down
are you sure all her signatures are real  it is not easy to get all those signatures
as far as i know they
looks like tim kobza
if it is about the posters i think it is so awful it is a travesty
a travesty  huh  that is interesting because i think you did it
you are off the hook tammy here has confessed
hello tracy
i am looking at new cars
oh  new cars  i see  well you came to the right place
my mother's buying me a new car for college
huh  right  college  wow  where are you going  where  would you get into
well i got in everywhere i applied but cornell is my first choice
good for you  good for you
anywhere you want  just so long as we are not gone more than a halfhour
that sounds good
doing what
coming to see me  are you trying to  humiliate me
i have got an idea
my house
swallows unsure what heaven or hell awaits him
i just have to get something i will be right back
would you sign it for me
take as much room as you want
you will be fine
i hope so
you will
nowhere  i do not have class until second period
even tried you at home  we have got a situation here
uh jim
oh  okay
thanks well i am going home now
just wait outside tammy
okay  but is this about the posters
possibly  please just wait outside
okay  because i know who did it  so i will just be outside
well this is hard for me but i think it is important to be honest do not you
what is it tammy
i am the one  i did it  i tore down paul's posters
looks at her skeptically  does not say a word
i did it
and when did you do it
this weekend
exactly when
i do not know yesterday  sunday
and how did you get in the school
door was open
which door
i do not know all i know is i did it i
i do not believe you
i have proof
your novel are you fucking kidding me
okay  give me the drill
should we get a what
points at the motel
no i uh did not know that
all his life  he is tried everything
still clear
take me to that motel  like you wanted
right now
easy tiger  come by after school i will leave darryl with the sitter
three twentyfive
three twentyfive
you are there
yeah  i am here
sherry i love you
do not say that  you know it is not true
it is the only true thing i know anymore
we made a mistake  let's not make it worse
a mistake  that was no mistake
i was lonely  you took advantage
me  i took advantage of you  you hugged me  you kissed me  you are the one who 
i wanted to play next year so bad i could taste it  and maybe go on to
i know  i understand disappointment i really do
and she is supernice
huh  oh  uh pears
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard
okay let's say
no wait  apples  apples
exactly  so what do you say  maybe it is time to give a little something back
no way i it does not make sense
sorry my figures work out exactly the same as jim's 256 for paul 255 for tracy
and 290 disregards right
if you say so
i am telling you dr hendricks every vote was accounted for
larry you just take it easy
i am not like you
i know
but other people can see them too
i do not care
well i do
it is a conflict of interest  and paul was first
for what
i mean at you
for what

yes  but do you know
why was susan lefferts at the nite owl
i do not know  i never heard of the nite owl till today
did lefferts have a boyfriend
like i said we were friendly not friends
how would she meet patchett
he is waiting for you to mention mention
you want some advice miss bracken
it is lynn
maybe i am just fucking curious
you say 'fuck' a lot
you fuck for money
there's blood on your shirt  is that an integral part of your job
when they deserve it
did they deserve it today
i am not sure
but you did it anyway
yeah just like the half dozen guys you screwed today
are you asking me for a date or an appointment
i do not know
if it is a date i think you would better tell me your first name because i 
forget i asked  it was a mistake
it is bud
so you saved her
yeah  but not for long
that simple huh
come in out of the rain  in the morning we will have both our stories for breakfast
he is the opposite of you  he is more like me  cold calculating
how would you get to know so much about him
you gonna tell me what happened with you and exley
we talked
so tell me about it
in the morning
no  now  you fucked him
this business captain
say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables
he made his play amd he got what he wanted  they are making him a detective
captain what do you want
call me dudley
dudley what do you want
and for good reason judging from what i know of your background
he helped me out once  that is all
wendell i want you to come to work for me
doing what  mowing your fucking lawn
i knew you had juice but there's no goddamn bill on me
four of the defendants recanted their testimony
of course but how
how what wendell
how would you get them to retract
you have got it wendell
seen him around  he used to be a cop
i got to write my report first
what  that new mystery girl you have been seeing
let my daughter rest in peace
five minutes  that is all
first i want to go on record as saying that my susie was a virgin when she died
ma'am i am sure she was
maybe  i do not know
look at a picture for me
you said a neighbor heard a ruckus  was it outside inside
no  please leave
easy  tell me about the ruckus
yeah  a great big one
it is a surprise  you like surprises do not you white
hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence
someone held up a coffee shop panicked and killed six people
officer white put down that weapon and 
get the fuck away from me
it will look like justice  that is what that fat fuck got  ujusticeu
you do not know what the word means you dumb bastard
somebody got wind of it killed them all
dudley's guys
they did not find the shotguns they planted them
it all keeps coming back to dudley
it is dudley for the nite owl
let's just kill them
which one are you and which one am i
patchett uses a lot of excop muscle
he had help getting up there  two of his fingers are broken
we had one thing figured wrong  i do not think dudley workd for patchett
at least not anymore
patchett's dead  he sent you after me  i would say dudley's tying up his loose ends
what about him
jack thought he was up to his neck in all this
me  you called it  i got a message that
a lot of bad stuff happened here it is as good a place as any for it to end
i spent years trying not to live down to mine 
i am not asking you
i am  are you soliciting for police charities  the last time you people called at my office
i am a homicide detective  where were you last night
i was here hosting a party  who was killed and why do you think i can help
richard stensland
i do not know him  mr
officer white  how about susan lefferts  you know her
you know i do or you would not be here  how did you find me
we met outside hollywood liquors on christmas eve  this is where lynn brackengs booze bills go
of course
sue lefferts died at the nite owl i am investigating
against your code
i do not have one  lefferts looked beatup christmas eve but did not act it  how come
do you care about criminal matters peripheral to susangs murder
that is right
i think she would been hit in the face with a tennis racket  she is  was  a big doubles fan
you wanna go downtown and discuss this officially
wait  our deal still holds
what little studio
of course this is personal with you is not it mr white
and you fuck people up for a living  that do not make me you ucapisceu shitbird
i ai not your upaesanou you wop cocksucker
you remember an excop named buzz meeks  he works for a guy named patchett
his file listed you as a known associate  now spill
before meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin
bullshit  where would a twobit excop get 18 pounds of heroin
deuce perkins  mickey c's narcotics lieutenant  the night he got clipped eighteen pounds of mickey's heroin went missing
i got a few nite owl questions
i do not know if you read the papers but that case is closed
i am tying up loose ends  padding my report  you know how it goes
what do you want to know
anything off  anything that did not make sense
you mean beside the fact that thirtyfive out of fortyfive rounds were gratuitous  i cannot think of anything
susan lefferts
if she was sitting here then it is facing the wrong way  what are these smears in the blood
it looks like she was flailing trying to get away
but she is moving away from the door  who was sitting at this table
dick stensland  had to be dumb panic  if she knew him she would have been sitting with him right
uear plugsu
exactly  at least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears
it does not exactly play like dumb panic
what do you mean
it is like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in
yeah so
and i will promote you  you will be a lieutenant immediately
i know that sir  i also know that when he made lieutenant it was as a detective
until he gunned down six people
someone must have pulled the records
i do not have time  i have 
just show me where they are
say what and so what
did one of the officers work you over a little
man why do you keep asking me that
that fucking larry  i almost believed him
believed what
nothing ray  that larry he is a pisser  you did the casitas youth camp with him did not you
man why are you talking about larry  his business is his business
you ai not woofing i did  stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fucking dog
dogs got no reason to live
oh  you feel that way about people too
man what are you saying
ray we got the shotguns
i do not own no shotguns
why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator
say what
were you on hop  you were passed out when you got arrested  were you hopped up ray
ty and larry fuck with that shit not me
where do they get their stuff come on  give me one to feed the da  just a little one
they shot him in his library
i do not want a floor plan i want to know who  who's taking the ticket for this johnny
nobody  at least not yet
and what about the merchandise deuce was holding for me
gone  not a trace
some ferstunkener is moving in and we do not know who  maybe we should ask hedda hopper
i am happy to cooperate  you do not need to tie me down
it is for your own safety  now what can you tell us about sergeant john vincennes
trashcan jack  the big v  i can tell you he is on the night train to the big adios
but you were business associates
what does that have to do 
he runs call girls  primo tail fixed up like movie stars
the youngest applicant by eight years
you will make lieutenant inside a year  patrol division
i was thinking detective bureau
answer yes or no
i no
would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis  yes or no edmund
white's a mindless thug
no edmund  he is a man who can answer yes to those questions i ask you from time to time
yes dudley  i am
so be it
his blood's always up
edmund you do not want it and you cannot have it
yes i do sir
it is mine  i will make you my second in command
get on it
i will break them sir
she may still be alive whoever she is
anonymous  probably nothing
tell that to jack vincennes  to stensland
something like that
ureallyu  would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis
okay  i will do it
i think you will be surprised what edmund's capable of
two minutes dudley  it is important
lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in santa barbara
a disgrace as a policeman straight d fitness reports from every co he ever served under what about him
part of it has to do with a murder  i have been working with ed exley on it
you are narco lad not homicide and since when do you work with edmund
it is a private investigation  i fucked something up and i want to make amends
do not start trying to do the right thing john  you have not had enough practice
that is right
i should have known  that is the chief throwing you
uthrowing meu
yeah exley  that is the payoff
you are the payoff expert  i am just doing my duty
give me a minute will ya
i want you to follow bud white
even i am not that crazy
yesterday yes today no  what happened last night
transfer me suspend me  just leave me alone
you make a mistake
yeah  my whole life
i ai not a priest lieutenant  i cannot hear your confession
do you make the three negroes for the nite owl killings
you should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the nite owl ulieutenantu
i have given up angles for awhile i just want to solve this thing
the nite owl was solved lieutenant
i want to do it right
a third  i do not think we can make a case without bud white
bud white  he sees us and we are dead
rita hayworth at the morgue and now veronica lake with white what the hell's going on
movie star hookers  whatever you desire it is fleurfrlis again
that is fleurdelis
i am going to lynn brackengs  i will meet you at the dining car
great  you get the girl i get the coroner
a guy dressed as santa has been exposing himself to kids in los feliz  apparently sir he is decorated himself
i get the idea  you got a description
of his penis sir
yeah  the fact that you guys will not let it get filed away
what are you talking about
bud white grilled me on it this morning  you know he is not as dumb as i thought
bud white's been here
a vulgar term but yes
that is her name
lynn bracken
why's she seeing bud white
why do men and women usually see each other
anything else you want to add before i talk to her
then try talking to my lawyer good evening gentlemen
i know who you are  you are the policeman bud told me about
really  what did white say
do not underestimate me miss bracken
the way you have underestimated bud white
oh the best i ever had absolutely the best
you sound like you mean it
the silver screengs loss is your gain
how about white
you want to know what bud's like in bed
i see bud because i want to  i see bud because he cannot hide the warmth he has inside him
i will take your word for it
some reality
no  this is the means to the reality  but i am not going to tell you what it is
why not
because you will use it against me will not you
you are the first person to ever call me tough
like recognizes like  i am pretty tough myself
you me and white huh
actually bud's only tough on the outside
forget everything else for a second lynn  is there anything you can give me on dudley smith
i work for patchett  i had a feeling that there was someone else but i never knew who
okay  look if it helps bud hates himself for what he did
i know how he feels
bisbee arizona  the air's good for pensioners and i know where everything is
where is he
some men get the world  others get exhookers and a trip to arizona
none  call it a hunch
the proof had his throat slit  so far you are not denying it
that is dudley's scheme
when was the last time you saw her mrs lefferts
at christmas  we had fought  i did not like her boyfriend  i  she has a birthmark on her hip
mrs lefferts i just want to ask a few questions
that other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss

i was uinu the store the accident was outside it was a bus
someone said you spoke to mr zavitz before he died i thought you might know something
about what

mr zavitz was in trouble
what kind of trouble
you tell me
i cannot
are you invoking attorneyclient privilege
i am not his attorney
than why cannot you tell me
because i do not know

stacy i found out like this this is the first i am uhearingu of
sources revealed an fbi investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars
i have seen it
at the center of the investigation are wellknown washingtonarea attorneys robert dean and rachel banks

that was a dance we invented at the international sand club
i am not sewing anything else
you do not have any money do you just in case there's silk
i love you

what do i do
you get hardy
i follow the wires
i have done this  i have had to do this
no but he hands them over
kiss me  before i cut  just in case
do not talk  check again  lie flat and then cut
this is what i do  i do this every day
yes  later
i try not to expect you
but if it got late and i had not shown up
then i would think there must be a reason
the lamp was burning all night in his room  caravaggio was there with him
of course  when
i mean home  india
kip i 
i know  here i am always a brown man there you would be always a white woman
is that what you think  is that what you think i think
it is what i have learned
then come with me
i will always go back to that church
so one day we will meet
it is not over everywhere  i did not mean literally
when he dies i will catch up
and what if he really is a spy
he cannot even move
if anything happened to you i would never forgive myself
he is from there  edge of lake ontario right soldier

i will ask the lieutenant  but thank you
he is sleeping
only we have to go to work

a bit of one
i was looking forward to this evening
i had a hotel room

i hardly knew the guy why be impolite to strangers
i do not recall authorizing you to have a personal life

the windows do not open
entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm
let a thousand flowers bloom chairman mao

it is not the thinking of it it is the doing it
with that computernobody better out thereit is different you twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on madison avenue
how would you approach him hello mr macdougal i am gin would you steal a painting with me
i would need an introduction from someone he trusts someone who owes us a favor
and a target guaranteed to catch his interest
which you have in mind
this was my first excuse to get away i cannot exactly use my cell phone
yeah yeah yeah that is the status
we are getting close
how close
i do not know but close

something of great value something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate
uh yes
meet me in front five minutes
i will call an ambulance
it is nothing serious i will just run into that building they will have some sort of first aid kit
you seemed to be handling everything quite nicely
are youokay
it was only a scratch far more damaging to my trousers than to me
that is good terrific
you are joking  you cannot trust anyone these days
maybe the thief thought you had something valuable you are in the business that is what roki says
like i would have art in my suitcase
of course you would not the rembrandt would not fit
excuse me
i sincerely hope so
oh i am taking youquite seriously
so what
so alive
youyou cannot
of course i can i have a note from mother
no why would i be
oh that is quite all right no charge
we were we are but this is perfect for you
not interested
well nobut
good i will call the concierge they can get you a new room book your flight home so forth
i am sorry this just means so much to me
the most important piece of chinese art outside of china
it is not for sale
roki has a vivid imagination
maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes
not a word
quite a good one a monet not major but it is giverney
i am not here to run errands i am here for the mask
if i cannot trust you to pick up a painting how can i trust you about the mask
that is my girl
it is simple you pick up the painting you pay for it with this debit card
i am payingone point five million and change i hate round numbers
give him the card
look on the back what do you see
that is what you are buying put it in your pocket
damn i knew i forgot something
not funny
up to you you could tell him the check is in the mail
not bad i did not expect you to make it out
you what
we are only going one way
i am not the one to ask
i never carrybaggage
certainly not mine come on
i am a thief sue me
where is my bag
no entrapment is what cops do to robbers
that is your problem i am doing the job
that is my problem you want a list
you really do not believe i would take on a partner after all these years without a littleinsurance
i am just curious what sort of security system you would have in your own house
hmmm i would be surprised if you could
i guess i have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do
my job my rules we have got a job to do no mixing business and pleasure
ui amu dressed
good morning
nice spot
it is  coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen we will start in twenty minutes
as i recall you have robbed it before
years ago if memory serves when does the exhibit end
in a week
they are having a farewell party the last night before the mask goes back to taiwan
that is when we will do it and we will need every single day
we go underwater
we are doing this together we are partners
you do not get the mask code unless i go
look i can help you need a sensor expert you have got one
this is not some picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room
a lifelong problem i am afraid
no dammit i mean me that rembrandtthat rembrandt
that is because i wanted them to
i wondered who would been giving me a bad name
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window it was the only way to bypass the smart glass
true enough
you need a partner for this job you will never find one as good as me
it was perfect
you are too easily impressed with yourself i believe i have made that point before
no one uneedsu anything except food and shelter the rest we just want
this is not a good time to hear your personal philosophy
we get the mask i will tell you
a partner with secrets is not much of a partner
without the mask it does not matter
so the mask is part of the down payment too must be a really big job
let's just see how we do
oh i think you can do it probably
we arefor the tools
try laps say a hundred
our equipment has arrived
it was a long time ago
yes you did
twenty four secondsas long as it takes the clock to strike twelve
and you have checked the ram to be sure it is synchronized with the clock
a dozen times
the lipstick thermal camera
one more itemnot on the check list
it isbeautiful
do not get any ideas of course it comes out of your share
thank you
it is not a village there's nothing there
straight down the drive right at the hedgerow follow the lane do not blink you will miss it
i have got something for you
little celebration before we set off
to ourpartnership
terrified still am
how in the devil did you do the rembrandt then
i had a lifeline if i have got a lifeline i am okay
are not we all
my father told me not to be afraid he would always be there for me
so you had to be your own lifeline
something like that
bookshelf sensors
popup on floorboards and
in eye of that painting
it is a party
let's mingle a little shall we
you are not on the beat
these rooms are solid stone they have not changed
you cannot be too careful
yes you can  you can spoil a perfectly nice dance
got it
behind you
the mask
no no please god you are wrong i am a thief just like you
yes yes
what do i need a thief for i have got the mask
it is your mistake
the big job
there is no big job
get the hell in
you do not know the half of it
speaking of money you said billions how many
okay 8020
my eighty your twenty smart guy
it is fiftyfifty less the cost of the dress
hold the record alone
i always knew you would do the job
there's food in the fridge i will not be long
you took the rembrandt i figured it was a fair trade
would you quiet down just for a minute
i would taken the mask
my job my rules
you are being useless i am making us rich
right the eight billion
where the money is
nope the cd instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded xj6
a parting gift from the empire
sit down i will show you how we are going to do it
it is no good without the argon gas
then the vault how to get in the vault that is stumping me
that is where the mask comes in
you have thought of everything
we are doing it tonight
there's no way to practice this and no time besides i have planned it all there are not any surprises
there's always a surprise
i have covered everything and you are the best so
you are overestimating yourself again that is worse this time you are overestimating me
feeling old
like a woman of mystery
cannot be too careful
surgically attached
no you will see when we get inside
cannot break tradition it is bad luck
there is one more thing
call it a new tradition
it was wrong to deceive you
but that is all behind us now
have really held you under
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention
i am sorry
oh i do not care about the money
four billion dollars
seen one billion seen them all
that is because you grew up rich
a flaw in your research my dear i grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast
what another job stealing the eiffel tower
they drive so recklessly there
i am leaving from the nathan road station at 630 tomorrow morning you could come too
brought us luck once maybe it will again
china will think it happened before midnight britain will swear it happened after midnight
they will each be positive the other guy did it  i fear an ugly international incident
hong kong midnight happy new year except at china bank
fucking thing
the disc is still in there
we cannot help it wewe have gotta
i sincerely hope not
no way
get out of here
no you cannot
i am not leaving without you
what about you
both sides of the street i am afraid
you gave them the eight billion
you mean the seven billion
we need to make the trade tomorrow
always in a rush
tomorrow it has to be tomorrow or forget the mask
next time i will use valet parking
which is
in the van
tina was a wonderful woman
do not go getting sentimental you are no damn good at it
yeah the lord of the manor does not haul his own groceries
and you do it so well
had to get a liquid plasma screen
the key to success is using the right tools
you are a miracle worker
it is never big enough
it is a death mask death mask means dead
black of course
this better be worth 1t
it better be worth it for me
how the hell i am supposed to know the damn difference
you look like george washington
the early bird gets the damn worm
but the second mouse gets the cheese
remind me why
because it pays off
we are supposed to
you better not be taking on a new partner
suspicious after all these years
you change partners you change the rules
you damn well thought wrong
i am terribly sorry old man
check out my ball
it is not just art it is history something you americans do not care aboutbecause you have not got any
that is because we live in the future which is that is on my mind
i am waiting for the tell part
she is calling the shots now
you are impressed with her are not you
she is good give her that almost as good as she thinks she is
she reminds you of yourself there's nobody you admire more
to yourself that is where
faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin i got to have trust
she will not tell me everything it is a bank job that is all i know
you are giving them to me
call it an expression of trust
thought you had to use some of these
i figured that out
i really do not think that is a topic on which you have much to offer
did i ever tell you what tina wrote the night she died
yes it does
i been meaning to tell you far as i am concerned you are over the hill
probably not
yeah probably not
that is a joke right
what the fuck did you do with my stuff
do not use language with me 
i am gonna assume that was meant as a compliment anna and just say thank you
250000 is all i am authorized to offer

it is pg&e saying to the judge that we do not have a case  their lawyers go 
he is got a reputation for doing all his

next week
wow that is soon 
who's baxter
he did did not he  ubaxteru
no one put me up to anything  i was just hoping i could ask you a couple questions
of course  oh gosh of course 
well from what this stuff says i would say they both have some form of cancer
the emperor
yes he commands you make contact with him 
move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission
yes my lord
and code the signal to my private chamber
come in admiral
yes admiral  soon
much anger in him like in his father
we have discussed this before
he is too old  yes  too old to start the training
we have come this far  he is our only hope
you are the last jedi luke  you are our only hope  be patient
the boy is our last hope
no  there is another
you must  luke look at me
i am cold  so cold 
you must go to the dagobah system  there you will learn from one who taught me  yoda the jedi master
ben  ben 
luke  you are the only hope
but han and leia will surely die
you do not know that  even i cannot see their fate
i can help them
you are not ready yet  you still have much to learn
i feel the force
and that is why i must go
luke i will not lose you to the emperor as i lost vader
you will not
growls a reserved greeting
everyone's invited of course
that is wrong with him
barks an argument and shakes his head
okay okay
barks and growls at his boss
that was a long time ago  i am sure he is forgotten all about it and so should you
why do not we just turn him over to lando to fix
not now chewie  lando are not you afraid the empire might discover this little operation and shut you down
no i am alright  i am alright
i am sure i will see you again too keep well  you would better chain him until it is over
what happened
barks his agreement
barks his right on
chewie head for the bottom of the city
barks his agreement
away put your weapon  i mean you no harm
looking  looking  you have found someone i would say  heh  yes
i am looking for a great warrior
a great warrior  not many on those  wars do not make one great
mine  mine  or i will help you not
mudhole  slimy  my home this is
okay artoo let him have it now get out of here little fellow we have got things to do
no no  i will stay and help you find your friend
i am not looking for a friend i am looking for a jedi master
oh a jedi master  different altogether  yoda you seek yoda
you know the jedi master
of course yes  but now eat we must  good food i have good food  come come
patience  it is time to eat
will it take long to get there how far away is he
not far not far  be patient soon you will see him  why wish you become a jedi
because of my father i guess
oh your father  a powerful jedi was he powerful jedi
sergeant is commander skywalker back yet
i have not seen him  he probably came in through the south entrance
probably is not good enough sergeant check on it
not likely  where are the speeders
we have not got them adapted to this cold yet 
we will have to go out on tauntauns
the temperature is dropping too fast
you bet it is  and luke's out in it
then i will see you in hell
there is a grave disturbance in the force
i have felt it
our situation is most precarious we have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction
our destruction  who
the son of skywalker  you must destroy him  or he will be our undoing
he is not a jedi he is just a boy obiwan could not have taught him so much that 
you are weak  i have seen it the force is strong with him he must be destroyed
but if he could be turned he would be a powerful ally
yes  yes  that would be a great asset
he will join us or die my master
he is checking out a meteorite that hit near him he will be in soon
with all the meteor activity in this system it is going to be difficult to spot approaching ships
you are an extraordinary fighter i hate to lose you
wait  i will send a patrol with you
fine  but they will have to take care of themselves
what is it
she is looking for master luke and assumed he would be here with you  no one seems to know 
go tell your precious princess  luke is dead unless he shows up soon
the energy shield is down  we will be stuck here forever
sit down and shut up
it can wait
if i may say so sir i noticed earlier that the entire main para light system seems to be damaged
we are in trouble
sir i am almost afraid to ask but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me
i must admit there are times i do not understand human behavior
i am going to see what it is
not collapsing honey  it is closing  this is no cave 
good  soon as we are clear we will kick this baby into hyperdrive
you said you were going to stay what happened
that bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind
does luke know
me  i do not know what you mean
you probably do not  how could you  you are so terrified of your own emotions 
and what are they pray tell
you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me
sure  if i were interested but i do not think it would be much fun
forget it
no kidding  if this snowball's got nasty natives they could be anywhere
what was it
droid of some kind  i did not hit it that hard  it must have had a selfdestruct 
an imperial probe droid
now do not panic  we do not know that
ooops  i guess you have not told luke about that yet
come on your highness are you telling me you have not been thinking about that kiss
wait do not open it  that is one of the traps for the ice creatures
do not worry your holiness i will get her started
this baby's got a few surprises left in her
i will be surprised if we ever start moving
two more star destroyers heading right at us
i am glad you said there was going to be no problem or i would be worried
or you ran into something 
probably an asteroid field 
let's hope so  it is just the chance we need
to get killed  you are not seriously going into an asteroid field
are not i  hang on sweetheart we are gonna do some flying
i take it back
that star destroyer is slowing down
i am against that
we have got to get out of this shower
now you are making sense
right  i am going to get in closer to one of these big ones 
what is it
that should do nicely
very funny  you can let go now  i am getting angry
you do not look angry
how do i look
well i hope you do not expect more
i do not expect anything except to be left alone
fine with me  but i am afraid you will have to let go
felt like a hydro concussion  an imperial cruiser
they are just trying to see if they can stir something up  we are safe
where have i heard that before
would you please stop calling me that
yes you do
you could be a touch warmer though  admit it against your better judgment you think i am all right
that is quite a compliment
afraid of  certainly not you captain solo  or any other man in this galaxy
sure they are safer  you always know what they are going to do trouble is it gets a little dull
there's nothing dull about a man i can depend on to be civilized
you mean a man you can control
i do not
try and control this 
look we just got this bucket going again  i am not about to let some varmint tear it apart 
but the tremors have stopped
the entrance is collapsing
it is not my fault  i cannot under stand it
you are going to attack them
chewie check the manual release on the landing claws
then we have to find a safe port around here  got any ideas
that depends  where are we
here  near the anoat system
you keep logs  my how organized
well sometimes  ahhah i knew it  lando calrissian
never heard of that system
no  but he has no love for the empire that much i know 
let er go chewie
it will be all right  trust me  and keep your eyes open  you wait here
who's staring
you look silly
you look great
has threepio turned up yet
luke  i am sure he is fine  probably sitting around wondering what we are doing right now
something's wrong here  your friend lando is very charming but i do not trust him
well i do trust him  lando's an old friend  must have been an accident
chewie do you think you can repair him
look sweetheart i am not going to have you accusing my friend of 
i am worried about all of us  i cannot figure out what they are up to
me either  they had me howling on the scan grid but they never asked me any questions
 just remember that cause i will be back 
i have finished my circle and i have not picked up any life read ings
thanks to you
that is two you owe me junior
that makes a good story  but i think you just cannot bear to let me out of your sight
now do not get the wrong idea pal she was just trying to express her true feelings for me
do not worry  you have not seen the last of us
no hard feelings
are you kidding
i always said you were a gentleman
i will bet
i am sorry too
shut up a minute and listen  i am doing what i can to make this easier for you
this ought to be good
he does not want you at all  he is after someone named skywalker
luke  i do not get it
do not ask me but he is on his way
you will find them well enough but they must never again leave this city
that was never mentioned  neither was this bounty hunter taking han i hope you have not forgotten our bargain
i forget nothing calrissian perhaps you think you are being treated unfairly
take them but i am keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them
that was not the bargain  you said the empire would not interfere in
i am altering the bargain  pray i do not alter it any further
you may call me leia
not really
i must say your beauty is unpar alleled  truly you belong here with us among the clouds
you are part of the mining guild then
i did not know you had a price on your head  vader has given you to the bounty hunter
 we are the bait
we have no use for your kind
there's not much chance but the bounty hunter's ship is on the east landing platform
you have probably never done an honorable thing in your life
sure i did  once  it turned out lousy
what chance have we got in here what are we going to do when they cut 
do not worry about a thing  i will get us going
his fate is sealed  you will be lucky to get out yourself  all systems are on alert  everything's locked
i did not say anything
wait a minute  we are not going back there
it is luke  get under him  slow down  easy chewie  line up your tracking system  lando open the hatch
are the coordinates set
that sounds familiar
i understand
is there any chance of them surviving out there
slim but yes there's a chance they have a shelter  it is not much but 
not yet  they are working on it now
what is it
we have no choice  send them up  and start clearing everyone out
so much has happened during the period of your indisposition sir
i will be back later
sir it is very possible this asteroid is not stable
i thought you knew this person
let's go
what did you say
i have this  feeling  i am not sure really 
that is just great  why does not everyone just take off
what are you talking about
first han now you  when am i going to learn not to count on anyone but myself 
hangs leaving
he wants to pay off that criminal he is in hock to
jabba the hutt
i could get more loyalty if i went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures
snow creatures  they are here
he will survive
i have never seen it fail
to become a jedi takes the deepest commitment the most serious mind
you are reckless
you will be my young one  heh you will be
i thought i was in good shape
yes but by what standard ask i  forget your old measures unlearn heh unlearn
no  no different  the differences are in your mind  throw them out no longer of use are they to you
okay  i will give it a try
no  try not  do do  or do not there is no try
size has no meaning  it matters not  look at me  judge me by my size do you
that is why you fail
i thought those seekers were set for stun
that they are
they are a lot stronger than i am used to
but i feel the force flowing
no no  easier quicker more seductive
but how am i to know the good side from the dark
no  nothing more will i tell you now clear your mind of questions  quiet now be  at peace 
yes  i also feel danger  death  something's not right
only what you take with you
free your mind and return he will
my mind fills with so many images
control control you must learn of what you see  not easy not fast
i see a city in the clouds
bespin  i see it too  friends you have there heh  concentrate and see them you will
i see them  they are in pain  they are suffering
it is the future you see
difficult to see  always in motion is the future  back away little machine
foreknowledge is helpful but painful sometimes and dangerous too  you have far to go in your training
i have learned so much since then  and i will return to finish  i promise that master
if it must be  yes
you will find i am full of surprises
and i too
i will die first
that will not be necessary
time will tell
yes sir  we have visuals  the system is supposed to be devoid of human forms 
anything on the millennium falcon
it will not get through the blockade
i want that ship
good god

with food
no  clothes  stevie they changed into them
i do not believe it
security  join the marines and see the zoo 
they look pretty docile
yes but do not take any chances
with particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas
keep him in cold storage till the reports in  then send him to taxidermy  he is a museum piece
he is a gorilla
zero emotional developments total lack of compassion a highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive
heavy third world connections they get weapons drugs fuel choppers  everything is pumped into the island from the south

that is good
yes i think so
it affects concentration
what is it a tranquilizer
a stimulant
stimulant she is higher than a kite right now
do you think i should take her to see a psychiatrist
have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities
wait a minute what are you talking about
well she let loose quite a string while i was examining her mrs macneil
you are kidding like what
well i would say her vocabulary's rather extensive
well what for example i mean give me a for instance
well specifically mrs macneil she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt
she used those words
she used those words look i doubt that she even understood what she was saying
yeah i guess maybe not you do not think a psychiatrist
lesion lesion in the temperal lobe it is a kind of seizure disorder
look doc i really do not understand how her whole personality could change
what was going on in there how could she jump off the bed like that
no of course not nothing like that
are you sure
well of course i am sure i would tell you christ i do not even smoke grass
are you planning to be home soon la i mean
please go away
i am father karras
that is okay i should have told you i would not be in uniform
yeah it would have helped have you gotta cigarette father
it is the other way around the society sent me through med school
you are a friend of father dyer right
yes am
pretty close
pretty close
did he tell you about my party
sure did
about my daughter
no i did not know you had one
he did not mention
he did not mention her
priests keep pretty tight mouthed then
that depends
on what
the priest
you would not
no i would not but i would try to persuade him to turn himself in
and how do you go about getting an exorcism
i beg your pardon
if a person was possessed by a demon of some kind how do you go about getting an exorcism
well it just does not happen anymore mrs macneil
oh yeah since when
why i do not understand
to begin with it could make things worse
but how
no i could not i have to have church approval and frankly that is rarely given
could you see her
yes i could i could see her as a psychiatrist
oh will you help her just help her
nothing you could do would make it any worse
i cannot do it i need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession
like what
like her speaking in a language that she is never known or studied
what else
i do not know i will have to look it up
i thought you were supposed to be an expert
yes i did i am sorry
no is regan aware of it
not at all why d'you ask
it is not important good night
are you sure
it is fine really sit
in europe
have you told him that is happening
holy water's blessed and that does not help support a case for possession
well me and sharon played a game in the back yard and we had a picnic down by the river

it never was
it was a somewhat extraordinary day
i just do not understand  you would think someone  anyone

good idea  to peggy lee
no you take the right
we might as well do the towels the same way
good idea
but if it does not work out let me know  i amflexible
yeah  you mind
why would i mind
i think what mr daniels is trying to say jack is 
why do not we let mr daniels tell us what he is trying to say
no that is your problem frank  you get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking threeyearold
that is the matter with you  so the piano's a little out of tune  so what
christ cannot you hear it

i am complimenting you cannot you ever just say thanks
sorry admiral  it was not mentioned in the job description
jon he is hooked up to a fullspectrum polygraph no one has ever beaten 
i do not care  he is manipulating it  that bomb has been built and it is out there somewhere
what do you expect us to do  shut down the city evacuate two million people on a hunch
yeah  me
my place
you should not have brought me here  it is dangerous
better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery trust me caz you will not be here long
should be  it is yours
of course he is    he is yours too
five  no one knows you are his father  i thought someone might want to hurt him  just to hurt you
you are not holding him right  caz 
yes  pollux bought one along with the original batch  obviously he found a way to make more
why would he need more
he is your brother you figure it out  maybe he made another bomb
or reactivated the first one
right  like jon archer would ever let that happen
you shoot hoops like a chick you smoke like a wuss and  i do not know  you are different
let me have a look
i do not know  everything's jumbled  so you are going to have to help me fill in a few blanks
a few blanks  like what
after that  you promised you would always take care of me
and i bet i have kept that promise 
only one you have never broken
that is worse than losing five million bucks
for what
for being one helluva guy
thanks  i guess they really did fuck you up
everything i say is wrong i cannot talk to her anymore
jon  we just remember how it used to be  you staying for a while or is this just a pissstop
we need to talk
i am late for surgery
it is important
so is finishing my residency and passing my boards 
something good
we were back in high school you wanted to join the sky diving team but i would not let you
must have been after we got engaged
actually  in this dream  i was your mother
so you had a nightmare
i do not know   maybe because you have never needed my help
one last time  it is important 
you said you would be here you promised me  you promised jamie  what could be more important than that
i cannot tell you  except only i can do it
you want me to tell you it is okay to leave  okay go on  go
eve listen carefully  the man you think is your husband  is not
do not hang up 
 i called but i am not castor  i am your husband
why point it at me  i am the real thing
i do not know that  maybe jongs already dead
what more proof do you need
tell me what happened on april 9th  13 years ago
what do you mean
he is going to kill off our bureau chiefs  onebyone
jon what is it
the bomb  he is reactivated it  and everyone there is going to die
cannot we call someone admiral lazarro
i know lazarro  the first person she would call is me we cannot take the chance of tipping castor off
no life signs at all he is a turnip
that is what they always say
would it
damn right
apparently fine  he is coming into work  that is the good news 
go on
castor's still alive   technically  he is a turnip on total lifesupport 
the left i think  those surgeons in witness protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet
she does not know  and she never will
either way come saturday morning  i am pulling you the hell out of there
call lazarro  castor just came out of his coma
just make sure you are there  on time
like gangbusters doc  okay i missed the last one
you missed the last three including her birthday  your wife's gripe sheet

i just asked you about making love to your wife and you started talking about your job
i am not hiding in my work if that is what you are saying
you said it jon not me
and how much will your fun net you this time
you are under arrest incredibly you still have the right to remain silent 
do not count on it
it cannot be  it is impossible
let's not confuse things anymore  i am archer you are castor  but if you need proof 
too late your kid worships me  and your wife  she is an animal  even i cannot keep up with her
vacuumsealed globe  should not take long
five seconds
not if i kill you first 
so's a noose  now keep your mouth shut
i am going to have you fired
pollux is  what
archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence he is free
walton you have to let me see the warden 
or what  you will have me fired
trust me he is already here get going
what makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother

i would like that too
so we will get egg nog
jersey  you know what the traffic's gonna be like
i am taking the train
i have got plenty of places to go
if it is something you feel strongly about
merry christmas
christmas  it cant be christmas
hey kind of under a little pressure here
hey kind of giving up christmas day for my exboss here
medical's ready
phase two
that cannot be  there's no direct connection between the two 
normally not unless it is an arteriovenous fistula 
the less time the better
i know that but that is the maximum
in his comatose stateand everything slowed downno more than sixty seconds
that would give us only three seconds to revive him
what are the problems in stopping the heart
nothing  compared to starting it up again
message to proteus
they will make up some time once they get through that and reach the pleural cavity  respiration post
it will be close  but there's still a margin of safety
let's find what the devil's holding them up  contact the proteus
i cannot help it i am just weak i guess
it means killing benes  and for all we know they may have completed the operation  damn it to hell
that blip we are picking up might only be the radioactive particle the proteus may already be destroyed
what are you getting at
i would hold that off awhile
well how about hypnosis that cannot hurt him
the pentagon was not it general only you were not in that uniform
the other side got to him
how bad off is he
brain injury
before or after what he wanted to tell you
here's the surgeon
sorry but i am rusty on surgeons who's the girl
cora peterson his technical assistant you will join duval and the others 
what can i do except maybe pass out
tell him where he fits in will you i have got a few things to check out
we have no choice duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country and he is right here at hand
i would not know if he is trying to save him or kill him
come along they will be operating shortly  see you later mike
no question of her loyalty
say that again
and take a little trip with them
trip where to
as part of the crew
wait a minute they cannot shrink me
grant our miniaturizer can shrink anything
but i do not want to be miniaturized  
it is only for an hour 
oh yes i have heard of you doctor
cannot remember what do you mean
he is blanked out on that one particular point
why do not you go on we will meet you at the clearance desk in a few minutes
meet grant this is dr michaels chief of the medical section
glad to have you with us mr grant
i do not agree just because he is often difficult 
difficult he is impossible
that is no reason to suspect him of disloyalty
and no matter what happens you are to take orders only from dr michaels understand
yesslowed down agreat deal
it must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool
we will know  in the next breath
we must
with no laser 
no danger of attack as long as you do not trigger them off by any injury to the system
yes there's no time to spare and those fibers can be quite tenacious
i  i want to say
i just wanted to thank you for taking me along
thank you for volunteering
they are much smaller than bacteria
but big enough for us
no danger of an embolism at our reduced scale they are much too minute to prove fatal to benes
i do not know yet doctor and i will not know until i test it
he certainly is he should be up and about in no time
we are pushing oxygen today
i will take some laughing gas ma'am
you sound as if you are not looking forward to it
well it is not exactly a pleasure cruise
you may learn to like it
now i know
not working for someone like dr duval 
i always thought it was nothing but red
and if it should take more time to get through 
doctor  is it possible that we are seeing it happen before our eyes
but i did i am positive
i have no idea
not now we need air not greetings
not anything built into the chassis  if it had not come loose 
a surgeon might
oh yes i am sure dr duval could if we had the parts
i have got a source all i have to do is tap it
i cannot till the hatch is flooded
i feel much better now
that is what they pay me for
a great deal more than that i believe
keeping an eye on dr duval
what gives you that idea
as obvious as that our security people will jump for joy  i suppose duval's onto me too
what do you mean
look they follow the direction of her glance are startled to see
i cannot breathe i have got to get out
it is too late now we must go on
i do not agree i think we ought to stop and take a sample
that is not the purpose of this mission  captain  keep a straight course  until you are in the clear
not in a sealed vessel like an artery  captain  something must be wrong with your controls
captain  head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it
you cannot believe all that is accidental that there is not a creative intelligence at work 
nothing  against all that force
better judgment to wait until the actual operation  when it may be too late
i have done all i could with the laser
all i am asking is you test it beforehand
i know only too well that is in the balance doctor and it is not my ego damned or otherwise
take a close look at your soul and your infinity and your god out there 
you left something out
that is that
the breath of god
we have no alternative with only six minutes left we will just barely make it
everything can be divided in half no matter how minute
they all lead to the same place  the lungs
no there's no other way
is not there another route so we can bypass all this
yes  we can transfer over to the inner ear and go by way of the endolymphatic duct
then why not take it
proclaiming in incandescent glory the myriad mind of man
if i can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels
it i can clear this central nerve that may be enough
we could follow the optic nerve to the corner of the eye
what about dr michaels
it is too late
at an operation
how are you miss peterson
a forced joining of an artery and vein must have happened when benes was hurt
yes we can go forward on this course but it means going directly through the heart
i am afraid there's only one thing we can do call off the mission
if there's any chance 
request removal mr grant
it lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime forty million beats
fasten yourselves in there should be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again
there's no other way tie my safety line to the sub
walt for the lull  between the time he inhales and exhales
just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes
but that will knock out our communications we will be cutting ourselves off from the outside
they will still be able to track us by radar because of the radioactive fuel
send the following message
his pleura's in fine condition it should be clear sailing through this area
let's hope so far somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice
that line was tampered with
i cannot believe it whatever happened was an accident
two in a row
it is possible 
i always had an idea there was only one system the circulatory
reticular fibers we ought to be clear of them soon
just what it is antibodies destroying bacteria  or any other foreign invader that threatens the system
let's hope they realize the danger  captain i will give you a new compass heading
sorry but the situation has changed
i thought i was on my vacation that is it all about
i cannot tell you
where we going
i cannot tell you that either excuse me mr grant but you have got a smudge on your cheek
go ahead
i am married
and she said it was indelible
sort of
that makes two of us
nothing you could see with the naked eye but there's a microscopic radioactive particle inside
it should work  theoretically if it does not the missiongs off the craft's nuclearpowered except for your wireless
designed for piscatorial research  the spawning habits of deep sea fish
remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus
positions please and strap yourselves in
enough to breathe but that is all
dr michaels he went berserk
berserk nothing he is the one who's been sabotaging the mission  get this on hurry
we can get out through the lab section
uh  what
we feel great do not we just great
oh  sure sure never better
nothing wrong with us not a thing we are fine  just fine
we are losing pressure in the flotation tanks check the manual right over there
could i run a tube through that wall without harming benes
look at those walls up ahead
what i was afraid would happen the stuff we passed through  that looked like seaweed 
i could use a lawnmower
on the repeater
looks simple to operate
i will guide you once we are in the heart
was there any damage
not to the valve but we have lost too much air to make it the rest of the way
then do not drift down further
i will do what i can
we are entering a capillary remain in the middle
the wall's transparent
it is less than one tenthousandth of an inch thick and porous
what do you mean
fluid is seeping through better come down and have a look
yeah i just came in i decided not to park here
i decided not to  i am uh not taking the trip as it turns out

but she might be in trouble
he bought you that
more or less it is part of my college fund
what are you going to do
improvise of course
sounds good i hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck  it might be kinds cool
you are joking right
what do not be a lightweightthis is top dollar toot
it is not that it is just that  it i get caught i will lose my science scholarship and everything
you are talking to the prom queen eva do you really think i am going to risk getting caught

rennie's not coming
she changed her mind  let's seemr wolfe is in stateroom oneeleven and you mr robertson are in twotwentyfive
it isdead
she isshe is dropping the anchors i thought the coast guard could find us easier if
what you sent her out there with a murderer running around loose
the fire alarm
this is jasongs fault
not another word do you hear me
we have to get off this ship
do not be ridiculous
then i will make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights
i packed it just for us
but i have not even shown you my biology project
jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up i am a little concerned
do not be they probably decided to explore each other rather than new york
charles there's someone else coming along too
and neither do you it is up to rennie to decide what she wants to do
she does not know what she wants she is never had a stable life
and she sure does not have one now either she needs to live
oh i can see that you have done a wonderful job of supervising the kids miss van deusen
where is she
oh dear god
that lunatic has been spouting off about jason since we boarded  it is no coincidence
but that does not prove that he is the one
walking corpses are not real
he is the son of the captain for chrissakes you would think he would be able to operate this thing
what are you talking about
nothing i went to her cabin and
a wonderful choice of places to dock a boat mr robertson
i do not think that is such a safe idea
my niece's life hangs in the balance right now every second counts
perfect for a swim is not it
he is not
oh he is indeed and ready to pull down anybody who falls in and cannot swim
you are telling a lie
am i let's find out
you can and you will swim rennie
i am staying
if miss van deusen knew how afraid you were of
she did not push me into coming
why are you doing this to yourself
i am staying
but sean said
i refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship
but what about the drowning boy i have been seeing
this is not a request
ii cannot
you can and you will
i was only trying to teach you but i pulled you out rennie i saved your life
me too but i am not sure uncle charles will be
just felt a little chill
that is wonderful miss van deusenthat is it about
i do not know what to say
have you seen my dog anywhere
yeaha lot
i seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone  in other words level with me
there's something i have not told you
i gathered that
maybe not but you are not telling me everything are you
whenever i get near the water i see this young boy drowning he tries to pull me down with him
about four years agoat crystal lake i spent a few summers there with uncle charles inbetween boarding school
after your parents passed away
no it was just a normal summer i have never been able to figure it out
what is your location
ii do not know
is your ship equipped with omega satellite navigation or loran
give me the degrees first followed by minutes and sec
i heard you were not coming
we changed our minds
but i did not get you one
forget it it is a dumb little thing anyway
i want to go home i want off this ship
what do you mean
where are they
the bowfront of the ship there's a hoist on each side that lowers them
just radio for help okay
is the ship going to sink
i am not going near any lifeboat
but rennie
i am not
drugs  then jason came he is here sean
please hurry
they are boys  and they are indian
are you sure
yes  i cannot talk like this
everyone takes his turn
it is the work of untouchables
in this place there are no untouchables  and no work is beneath any of us
i am your wife
all the more reason
there's no room and the air is lovely
i will follow close behind you and help to serve the people
i will follow you in all our vows and duties
no that is what you get for distracting me
what do you expect when you talk like that
i expect you to show as much patience as i am now
nothing's more dangerous especially for an old man
i am sorry
i thought you were a man of god
i am but i am not so egotistical as to think he plans his day around my dilemmas
well we shall try
let me hang on with two hands or i will fall
going nearer to god
did they take your clothes
i think you do  but i thank god we all do not
ah but my puritanism runs the another way i am far too modest for such a display
it does we must be getting old charlie
how does a reporter in central america learn that gandhi was born in porbandar anyway
oh i have been a gandhi buff for a long time
back in south africa  long time ago
what was he like
lots of hair and a little like a college freshman  trying to figure everything out
well he must have found some of the answers
he said he is in charge
a  a week
well i do not know how you got a ticket for 
no no  just a moment please
i think if we all worked to publicize it all of the congress every avenue we know
we must end the campaign
it was one incident
tell that to the families of the policemen who died
panditji  please help me
he is waiting he is not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think
wait and see wait and see
that the fighting will stop  that you make me believe it will never start again
hm and what should an important professional write about your response to general smuts's new legislation
i do not know i am still searching for a response
you will respect the law
there are unjust laws  as there are unjust men
that is right the word only means community but it could stand for village or the world
i hope not
even as a boy i thought so
hm  is it
perhaps i have come here to think about it
a great deal
it would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing
my name is walker and i intend to report it the way it is
i would rather march
first spin let the others march for a time
i do not know i know you are right i do not know that this is right
you should ride the pony it is not necessary to walk to prove the point
no no in every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other
an eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind  we must stop
muslim and hindu are the right and left eye of india no one will be slave no one master
not true  the secret is mastering the urge
there is nothing i can give
that was england
i can but i risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less holy than mr baker
allah be praised and what battalions will you call upon
i  i will write to the press  here  and in england  and i will use the courts
the fools  sorry
it is split the government
well that is one victory
thank you no
i dined at the prison
somehow i expected not
i assure you i feel a very ordinary man at this moment
yes  yes it is just that in these clothes i would  i would prefer to go by taxi
all right fine
i am  i am afraid i have no money
oh  neither have i  i am awfully sorry
he is discovering india
no  but i think i am going to
have you found him
bapu  please where are you going
come with me now vincent  you have gone as far as you can go
there are a few million miles to go yet
it is over
is that the only way you can succeed anton to see me fail
it is for the best
you did not beat me that day  i beat imyselfi
who are you trying to convince
i will prove it to you  come swim with me now vincent  nowtonight
now is your chance to find out
too late for that  we are closer to the other side
er no
it would be five thousand more
not yet i am afraid
no  that is keeping you
i guess i am a slow learner
i guess so  well while you are up there maybe you could tidy the place up a bit
i will see what i can do
i will take care of it
of course sir  we are checking the entry log alibis grudges
with respect sirit may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests
what iabouti his profile
no  not ilikelyi
who knows with these deficients  his profile indicates a proclivity for violence
i will run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections
i have already run it  there's no record of any living relative
what a pity
this iisi the most likely location
this is a murder investigation  the public should be happy to cooperate to get this disease off the streets
a customer  does this michael's cater to misfits
no  but one or two borrowed ladders have shown up there in the past
none of the id photos match the enhancement
a man can change his facebut blood is forever sample every employee within the parameters i gave you  intravenous
something's not right
he is not here  it is a blind alley
no we have missed something  we hoover again
we do not have the manpower
get it  from outside if you have to
from what budget
i will take it out of your damn ipensioni if you question my authority one more time
where do we start
we will vacuum these streets if we have to
where did you get this
we have to be certain  once they are up we can hardly turn the boat around
what a relief
this unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor
thank you no
one look through there and you would know why i cannot possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further
you are so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst
this time i will supervise each test personally
i will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission  we are already counting backwards
now iyou arei here  who are your friends
it is about the director
i have been looking for him  do you know where he is
he is probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes
that is wrong with him
you have more in common than you know
six one
he is too tall
yeah  you want to go dancing tonight
if anybody asks tell them the truth your family disowns you  you are a disappointment jerome
what about this
wrong color  it is silver  it is not easy living up to this
you had to be a righthander
noone orders southpaws anymore
imorei than that  you will get used to it
god what iwould noti you do to leave the planet
you do not know what a relief it is not to be me  are you sure iyoui want the job
listen i bag this stuff anyway  it may as well pay my rent
the mission director
you wish
they found him in his office this morning beaten so bad they had to check his nametag
he was still warm when they confirmed
this calls for a celebration  does not it
the place is crawling with hoovers
so what  you did not kill him did you
you are right there's more atmosphere where you are going
keep going  keep going
and drinking it  it is like evian by the time it is filtered
what iisi that one
how long do you stay up there before you go
a day or so
you know i am scared of heights
it is okay eugene
you know i was not drunki knew what i was doing when i walked in front of that car
what cargo to sleep
i walked right in front of it  i was never more sober in my life
i am proud of you vincent
any particular reason
we cannot stay here
what are you talking about
they think i offed the director
they found my eyelash
could be worse  they could have found it in your eye
i am not going anywhere  less than a week to go not on your life
you do not understand they will make the connection they will hoover again  we should cut our losses
i am sorry  i think i was crying
i am sure i could have
you are the one who said not to change anything she is my ear to the investigation
is that all
i have got enough on my mind without that
if you say so  the stripe
good choice
i do not feel too good  i think i am still drunk from last night
complicated  i could not stop her apologizing
of course not  but she is have to know eventually
she does not ihavei to know  she does not iwanti to know
i am sorry  i have got plans
i am sure you will be very convincing
you may as well invite her here
will you be okay
how long
i was never very good at it remember
not bad jerome
how the hell did you get here
i could always walk  i have been faking it
have you forgotten  i do not need any samples where i am going

i got the better end of the deal  i just lent you my bodyyou lent me your dream
we would like vincent to have a brother you know to play with
we want himwe were hoping he would get married and have children  we would like grandchildren
i have to caution you it is not foolproof with multigene traits there can be no guarantees
they are not babies maria merely human possibilities
i think i could do something  provided you know what you are doing and you can meet the terms
vincent come down  i have found him
no problem  before he dropped out he was an honor student the right majors
how do i square the accident
even with lifts i am never that tall
there's a way
why not
these new personality corrections i have been reading about
you worried about the cost
not that
i have found him too
a fingerprint  there's something to be said for nostalgia  what did you find
i have been asked to compile a log for the investigatorsthey want to know everyone's whereabouts last night
last night  i was at home
no it cannot be verified  yes i was alone
i was at home

i have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot do not you
we were just looking
i know about you
they found an eyelash
does it have a name
just some invalid  vincent  somebody
you celebrate jerome
why would i be angry  it was beautiful
you will be next

just thinking out loud
yeah well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself
all right then  he is interested in you for your conversation  we know what a great talker you are
fuck you
not anymore you do not  doll
we are watching the movie harry you got that  we are watching my fucking movie
go wash glasses if you do not like it
maybe it is supposed to be funny
funny is funny and scary is scary you do not mix them
that is to be jealous of
i have gotten to know someone who's famous
not so famous any of us have ever heard of him
it means it is too cold to go swimming  and i do not mean the water
i was not going to try anything
yeah and i am never going to smoke another cigarette
it is different  he is a man  and by the way you have no business calling him a homo
it never crossed your mind
he is an artist  anyway he is too old to think about sex
all the old men i know think about nothing but sex
hey no strings right  that is what you always said  just good pals who have the hots for each other
it still hurt  a lot
i did not mean to
sure  i loved it
if you enjoy it you should do it
you know i just cannot do that anymore  i still have time to get things right  get married again 
you mean us
sure you are free for now at least but how long before you are just alone  pathetic and alone
is that all this conversation means to you  am i going to put out or not
damn straight  i am sick of playing games
the master is waiting for you
i am keeping away  what you are doing is no business of mine
what are you talking about
what kind of man are you  are you a good man
yeah i am a good man  something make you think i am not
you will not hurt him
you do that
expect nothing fancy
tea is fine
that is okay hanna  i am more comfortable in here  it is hanna is not it
long enough  fifteen years
i bet you have seen a lot of famous people come and go  movie stars
your wife
i am not married
a man who is not married has nothing  he is a man of trouble you need a woman
you proposing what i think you are proposing  do not you think i am a little young for you
of course  i am married still
yeah  that is your husband do
he is dead now twenty years
then you are as single as i am
this is what the priests tell me his sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven
sins of the flesh  everybody has those
no  his is the worse  the unspeakable  the deed no man can name without shame
a homo
yes  you know
you did not know
wellno not really 
you and he are not doing things
yes  i trust you
there is nothing you can say that will surprise me
maybe  but i still need to talk do i have time for a cup of coffee before i go
what do i do
take care of mr whale like he was your flesh and blood
i put him to bed  he is not there
oh mr jimmy
he wanted me to kill him but i did not  he did it himself
but i did not do this
the police will not know that they will want to investigate
we have his note
you are right  yes  we must put him back
nice place
and your name is 
boone  clayton boone
i could not help but notice your tattoo  that phrase  death before dishonor  what does it mean
just that i was in the marines
the marines  good for you  you must have served in korea
yeah  i better get on with my work
just got away from me  sorry to disturb you
no  iced tea's fine
what  oh yes
excuse me but  are you famous
you know what they say  if you have to ask 
i am just a hick who cuts lawns but some of these look familiar
yeah  what were some of your movies
this and that  the only ones you maybe have heard of are the frankenstein pictures
i made only the first two  the others were done by hacks
still  you must be rich  making a couple of famous movies like those
merely comfortable  here's hanna with our refreshments  can you get the door
i returned recently from a stay in hospital
what was wrong
nothing serious  a touch of stroke
you mean like posed for pictures
sat for an artist  been sketched
that is to sketch
you have the most architectural skull  and your nose  very expressive
broke is more like it
but expressively broken  how did it happen
football in college
you went to university
just a year  i dropped out to join the marines
yes  you were a marine
indeed  i would pay for the privilege of drawing your head
but why
even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him
and it is just my head you want nothing else
what are you suggesting  you will charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder
you do not want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit right
i have no interest in your body mr boone  i can assure you of that
excellent  we will have a most interesting time
you do not say  which picture
bride of frankenstein
hmmm  i much prefer show boat or the invisible man  shall we begin
it is new
pish posh mr boone  i am not your aunt tilly
but it is just my face you want to draw
oh if it is going to make you uncomfortable  perhaps we can find something else for you to wear
all right already  i will take it off  kind of warm in here anyway
that is exactly what i intend to do
no  i am fine
it is  only the poorest families ever ate it  we kept ours in a crockery jar
your family ate dripping
of course not  as i said only poor people 
no you were middle class like all americans
i guess you would say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks
i do not mind  i am not crazy about my old man either
all right i guess
i assume you worked up an appetite with your labor
go ahead
this david's a friend
did you now
i liked it  we all did
did anyone laugh
why  was it supposed to be funny
i do not like to talk about that
it is nothing to be ashamed of in the service of one's country that is something to be proud of
proud  any jerk with a gun can kill someone
quite true  handtohand combat is the true test  did you ever slay anyone handtohand
no  i could have though
yes i believe you could  how free is your schedule this afternoon
full up  i got the hedges to do here then another lawn out by la cienega
what is we say phooey to the hedges  could you spare an hour after lunch  to sit for me
cannot today
i will pay our going rate  plus what you would get if you did the hedges
sorry  i do not feel like sitting still today
all righty  i understand
you ever been married mr whale
no  at least not in the legal sense
or a husband  depending on which of us you asked  my friend david he lived here for many years
no i  you are a homosexual
oh dear  if one must have a clinical name
i am not you know
i never thought you were
you do not think of me that way do you
what way might that be
you know  look at me like  like i look at women
what you do is no business of mine live and let live i say
i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today
no  i 
it will only make you selfconscious  you will have to remove your shirt
sorry  not today
but we have to match the other sketch
i just feel more comfortable keeping it on  you just said you did not want me selfconscious
i am fine  i would just rather keep it on
of course  i do not want to scare you off  not before i am finished with you
not at the moment
why not
you know how it is  you have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it
very well put
the world is just one kissass game after another  a man has to make up his own life alone
ah  a philosopher
thoreau with a lawnmower
in a way yes  i suppose so  i know it is why i stopped making pictures
it is so far in the past now  over fifteen years 
better work
i assure you mr boone i meant no 
from now on mr whale i cut your grass and that is it  understand
you first
oh no  i never swim
i would like to sit for you again  but only if you ease up on the locker room talk  okay
i do not know  i guess i like your stories
everybody has stories to tell
not me
what about your stint in korea i am sure it was full of dramatic episodes
i told you  i do not like to talk about that
not fear  more like disgust
no teammates in football  no comrades in korea
you must think the whole world is queer  well it is not  war sure is not
oh there may not be atheists in the foxholes but there are occasionally lovers
you are talking through your hat now
not at all  i was in the foxholes myself
you were a soldier
i was an officer
i did not 
why do i tell you this  i never told david  i never even remembered it until you got me going
you are the one who started it
of course i remember  do you think i am so senile 
no harm done
it was foolishness to attempt this portrait  you cannot force what will not flow
you do not want me to sit for you anymore
very good clayton  may i call you clayton  or do you prefer boone
clayton is fine
do i look okay
if that is okay
nothing would please me more
i do not hear anything
exactly  cukor was too cheap to hire music  there's nothing but chinwag  the cold dreary custard of english chinwag
nothing of importance  just two old men slapping each other with lilies  shall we have a drink
david  the friend i thought was in new york
no  the girl
girl  oh  elizabeth taylor
david produced her last picture
actually no  i feel a little out of place
neither of us really belongs here
must have been funny for you seeing your monsters again
monsters  the only monsters  are here
run for what
cannot you see  it is raining
you do not want to wait it out rain should let up soon
we are not sugar  we will not melt
catch my death
just a night out  sounds like she cannot say no to her daughter
certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man
good  let's get dry
ten minutes ago  did not you hear me calling
i am afraid not  terribly sorry  i believe i promised you some clothes
no  definitely not
you do not have any baggy shorts pajama bottoms
very sporting of you clayton
the only memento i ever kept  my original sketch for the monster
i thought you would given up on my picture
i would like to try again  if you are game
why not  give us something to do while we wait
never gave it much thought
but you said 
 that i was a marine  which is true  you filled in the rest
i see
the great war
by the time he was ready to ship out the fighting was over  he missed out
a very lucky thing indeed
i did not have the guts for it
them's the breaks right  no war stories for this pup
that is where you are wrong clayton you have just told one  a very good story indeed
not at all
a perfect night for mystery and horror  the air itself is filled with monsters
that is from your movie right the only monsters are here
i do not remember that one
james whale  this afternoon at the party
but that was so long ago  it cannot still bother you
oh but it does  especially in light of the journey i am about to make
you are planning a trip
your friend
you survived it  it cannot hurt you now  it is no good to dig it up
what would you say
what will not do
you are much too human
what did you expect  bronze
do not move
i do not know
please clayton  just for a minute  long enough for me to see the effect
it is from the first world war is not it
there are straps in back
what was that
it is too tight
relax clayton  i cannot hear you i cannot hear a word
oh but you feel good clayton
i have not done a damn thing with you
oh clayton
did i hurt you
nothing i did not deserve
need some help
pray you undo this button
all right
you will feel better tomorrow
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
fuck off
you told me to get you up asshole
hasta la vista boone  and give the jail bait a squeeze for me
you ever hear of this whale fellow
i think i will hang around
have a drink
good  fine
i just want to watch it okay
the monster's lonely and he wants a friend a girlfriend somebody what sick about that
i thought i would give you a hand since i kept you open
she took the night off  heavy date  some guy she is had her eye on for a while
i wanted to be alert for your visit today  especially since i saw so little of you in the hospital
the fault dear david is not in ourselves but in our stars
you remember how a production eats up one's life
thank you
goodbye hanna
just what i was about to ask you i thought you were in new york
i was until last night  publicity asked me to fly miss taylor in for today's reception
oh david stop being a nanny
you did not jimmy
i did  but princess margaret was a doll  we are all equals in her eyes  as commoners i presume
you only embarrass yourself
oh dear  i will never work in this town again
you know what i mean  your reputation
but i have no reputation  i am as free as the air
well the rest of us are not  cannot you remember that
no  i never could  you must regret having had the invitation sent
then who did
jimmy there are people here i need to speak to  you will be fine on your own
yes  perfectly
all right then  i will come by tomorrow for breakfast
that is what i am trying to explain
so what do i do
take the luminal to sleep or whenever you feel an attack coming on
oh no my dear  you look absolutely amazing  there's no way i can compete with you  the scene is yours
in the sequel james two lady scientists should make a monster and our monster would be gary cooper
i would have thought mr leslie howard would be more your line
more your line
my line nowadays runs to rin tin tin  dogs are so much more dependable than men
bring a mirror  let the bride feast upon her visage
boris  do i look a fright
nonsense my dear  you look extraordinary  today's script  quick  and a pencil
oh nothing out of the ordinary growing old
we are all getting a bit long in the tooth
but you appear quite fresh my dear
perfectly all right  but if you would like to sit 
i am fine jimmy  i can only stay a few minutes
of course
that is our pesky friend up to now
oh dear
goodbye  so nice to see you
bone  boom  something bee  i hire him while you were in the hospital  he came cheap
yes mr jimmy  an interview  after so many years very exciting
do not be daft  it is just a student from the university
i do not think you anything anymore  just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys
oh shut up  all we did was talk my attack had nothing to do with him
perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold
no  let me lie here  thank you
my mind's lovely  and yours
just go  we can manage without you
do not be silly hanna  he is a very proper actor  and the dullest fellow imaginable
no hanna  my heart is not that black
she is beautiful
i will be fine hanna  thank you

okay see you later
fine bob how are you
never better
what do you want to do
i want to be an actor
then express yourself bob
basically the same thing in a very evolved esoteric way
you open 'em up and there's the sayings stories little bites of insight it is the ppp six day week
so you eat read it everyday
correct  that is for you keep it
it is nice to see you again
since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word
ten years i think what i miss
i am in california most of the time traveling a lot on business that is about it really
that is it
not much else
that is your business
i am a professional killer
professional killer do you get dental with that
more like what happened what happened mr blank
you see someone
no i am not going is that why you are here
that is part of it
well there's not much to tell
i am sure you have done worthwhile things in the last ten years you have had experiences
bad experiences
you met people
bad people
watched television
bad television
jesus marty you are pathetic it sounds like you need a shockabuku
that is that
it is a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever
that would be good
let me get this straight are you asking me out
i will think about it
you are fucking psycho
do not rush to judgement until all the facts are in
as long as i get the laugh
here let me put these in some rubbing alcohol
okay hold on
i will just help myself to a cocktail
i think they will probably have booze there
no time
okay then clearly candied diller
like heroin
too junkykitschy deeper deeper
like love
could be the physical substance of love
it is something i do
get the fuck outta here
like that there's a point an organic connection between all living things
let me help you along martin you are a sociopath
a sociopath kills for no reason i kill for money
you never could have kept this from me
i was leaving
that is probably a good idea
will you come with me
i am staying here
what if i come back
i will hide
that is because i speak human and you speak monster
it is in michigan honestly what do i have in common with those people or with anyone
come on
tell me about your vision of the reunion
i just know
say more
we are both professionals oatman
maybe some of the discomfort you are feeling is guilt remorse over the innocent people you have killed
saw my mom i am with debi and i am on my way to the reunion
out loud
take a deep breath and realize that this is me breathing
this is me breating
effective but to tell you the truth i have lost my passion for work
do you like the people you work with
i work alone
i do some guys cannot adjust to it they cannot handle it
sometimes i am sometimes it is only natural
it is only natural
i am setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts
like a union
like a club work less make more
thank you no
i am gonna get you kid
wholegrain pancakes and an egg white omelette
no harm no foul
a little misunderstanding among my associates
hard to get good help these days
but since we are both here i think it is time to take a fresh look at our relationship
yeah after i shoot you through the fucking forehead i am gonna fuck you in the bullethole
nice talk sugarmouth
excellent here they come
hello martin how have you been
not bad you
hey bob
that sounds pretty interesting
those all seem kind of related
here take my card wait a minute here's a special one for topshelf clients
i guess
well remember when frysal's men paid off the deejay in cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the 
it was the plo
we cannot do our job unless he does his job
wait a minute
he using her
you are wrong look at his face
one cannot love and kill
i love i kill
if he does our job he is our job
i get it
patch him through
it is from one of those po boxes how was the trip
tedious i now authorize you to throw away all personal mail
all of it
and not show it to me ever again
that is going to cost
i will pay
i am not happy
they say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep
he did not
they blame you for the compromise
and they want me to make up for it
in detroit this weekend
tell them that is impossible i need my normal lead time
they were very upset
would you describe their position as inflexible
intractable sir you leave tonight
there's nothing to be done about it
i liquidated the last account in zurich and split it into two new ones in estonia
good what else anything interesting
mmm not really but you are gonna love this one
but it is a greenpeace boat it would be so easy
paperwork on the detroit thing it is a full dossier very comprehensive
see you next week
i will do it tomorrow
it is fine
you have not looked at the dossier
i have looked at it
yes it is the same as usual nothing remarkable about it at all

apparently the guy who pulled you out was not a passenger
a mystery guy  not a passenger who
what  they found what
he will do it  you reallyshould have talked to him first
if you reach out you could get pulled over yourself
she is flying to new york  she is been nominated for a silver mike
a silver mike  you are covering us in glory
relax wally  he had the shoe and the shoe checks out
does this mean i can stop worrying where would we put him
said he is not an actor
we paid him a million dollars you would think he would want to cooperate a little help our ratings
she cannot quit
who lost a shoe  wash your hands
the unknown hero  they found his shoe right beside the plane crash
you were in bed  were not you
i i saw him out the window
whwhy's he why's he up there mom
never reach out
hello mister wallace
you did not
i said i wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him
we are from channel four yes  we would like to find 
look at the guy  he just saved fifty people  now he is going to disappear who is he
he is pretty remarkable
you did not get it on with him
do not be ridiculous  i am a reporter
reporters do not have hormones
reporters have to rise above their hormones
what about
i did not ask him
call him back  ask him  i am a littlebusy
no joke lieutenant
where is the guy we saw in the beginning  that is his name
parker  we found him knocked out in the can
if he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby
not now  i am busy
they appear to be authentic
why are people walking around new york with swords dressed in mid evil clothing
well technically it is not mid evil   it is renaissance
yeah  how would you know that
what is it
a tape from the surveillance camera at the first national bank  it was robbed this morning
i would like you to see this
y'know the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset  we are stepping on their toes of this one
this ties in with nash
we do not have any proof of that
i do not need proof  i know it  send it out
i think it was england
interrogationgs over bedsoe
a few days ago
that is what i figured  well i have a little home coming present for you
i already told you  i took a walk
tell me again  where would you go
central park
does not it scare you walk through the park at night
no  i do not scare easy
where have you been for the last seven years
you did not bring me here to talk about her
he does not look familiar  but then he would probably be easier to identity with his head
is that it
lieutenant you are really frightening me
get outta here
no  it is not  a cop died today and the other is barely holding on  i want some answers nash
i am sorry about that  but i had nothing to do with it
most people are afraid of death
hey  somebody want to gimme a hand here
since we hardly know each other i am sure you will understand if i hold one to it for awhile
caution shows wisdom
we too are brothers macleod  in fact you have more family than you think
who are you
thomas cavenaugh  i am a teacher of sorts  like romeriz i help those newly acquainted with our life
i learned my fill from romeriz
indeed you did  and now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him
perhaps  but if i must face it let it find me for i shall search for it no more
cannot you enjoy it quietly
are you always this pleasant  you know what you are problem is
i hear you
what else  what else do you hear right now
that is all
i see  you do not care about life anymore
leaving what
england  there is nothing for me here anymore
and what do you think you will find in another land
maybe myself
then it is worth the journey
for what
i am sure they will
as friends  always as friends
we cannot write our destiny macleod in the end it could be you and me
that is a thought that does not please me
if it came down to it what would you do
the sea and i do not agree with each other  where we off to
not long  we should arrive in the morning  are you going to be alright
me  of course
living  remember
you may be living  but this suit is killing me
she is the king's cousin
then she should be an excellent dancer
i have learned that a man can only go so along living alone
the only thing you can do  you must end it
no  i will
i stood up first
that does not matter
you always get to go first
no  after you
can you really tell from doing that
what do you think
i think you just like to eat dirt
she is a treasure she is
she will soon be of age
would'st you harm one who comes to aid you
and what would'st i gain from this bargain
your life
i lied
different places
the past
because it is the past  and things that are in the past are best left there
why not
i am leaving in the morning
you will no see me again
do you love me conner
where i am going you cannot follow
why are you doing this
because it is for the best  there are somethings that are better left unexplained
any idea how big the cavern is on the other side
no  we are from strange facts and mysteries  it is a syndicated show out of
paul  i thought we agreed  no press
i remember you
i was wondering if i could talk to you
are you a cop
no  i am an archaeologist
what do you want
to talk to you
i do not think we have anything to talk about miss hillman
in the highlands
a lucky guess
bullet proof vests do not bleed
you got me
why do i feel that you know that is going on
are you the type of person who takes advice miss hillman
if it is good advice
this is  go home  stay out of this
why  that is going on
it is mine  it is been in my family for years  it belonged to my great great great grandmother
i will be fine
that is going on  why did he call you macleod
because it is my name
then who's russell nash
i do not know anymore
you remind me of someone i used to know
who was that man last night
i do not know
then how did he know your name
new york is dangerous place
it probably would not interest you it is something i read in a mythology book
i am interested in mythology
have you ever heard of the calan
you are twenty minutes late
i know
i have lived all over the world
why  because i do not give up all my secrets
how come you wanted to meet tonight
i wanted to get to know you better
a little  yes  my interest in coming here is profession
is it
yes  it is
alright  in the shop you mentioned something about
the calan  do you know who they are
why do not you tell me
because i do not feel like sitting in a rubber room for fortyeight hours
you do not really believe this do you
for three hundred years
how could that be  people do not live for three hundred years
not unless they are immortal
i have seen it
on the back it has
the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word  courage
how did you know that
and the other one  he is like you
it will end tonight
must you fight him
he will not stop until it is over
get out
now i can start to live  to feel to grow old and live each day without the promise of another
sounds very  normal
they have had a little car trouble i am afraid they will not be here until after dark
what  how
i do not know
that is that next to him
his head  someone cut it off
i do not think it is a duplication
it has to be
and this
i was working on the cataloging
jennifer there is more to life than work
i know paul
i am having some people over tonight for dinner  i would like you come
we will see
it is not been long enough  what witchcraft is this

why did you wait
i know
the police still have a lot of questions for russell nash
i can take care of myself

i love you conner
aye  i know las  and i have never loved anyone more
i will no forget you
and i you  go now  let me walk to heavens door alone
i should not have come back here  it was a mistake
is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they are in trouble
yes  when their troubles can harm them
why will not you ever let anyone help you
there's nothing i can do  i will wait one way or another soon it will all be over soon

you are the doctor sweetheart 'guess the atropine worked then
convinced all those that needed convincing you are an official dead lady
and that is stevengs status
still alive but it is just a matter of time and then will come your miraculous resurrection 
it is complicated but do not worry 
so we do not even know if she is alive or dead 
 price killed her there's no other explanation 
 there's plenty for all we know stevengs got her spying on us right now 
okay this may sound crazy but 
not at all
pritchett take it down a couple hundred decibels what is your problem
it was on my dad's list of things to do but the house did him first
oh dear

 the saturation chamber where he wanted to put me
donald w blackburn md
i got an engraved  literally  invitation  with my name 
 i am sure you did
three times to be exact
excuse me
accidents fatal each of your prior wives so we have been informed

 she is not dead just have to get her heart pumping aqain
 what was he doing here
running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody 
did not catch his or her name just followed them down here somebody all in white surgical gown
i think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation
as a tumor
if this is someone's idea of a joke 
yeah me too
and i think that is case 
i will stay if it will ease your mind
you sure you will be alright by yourself
i am just the greeter  and in that capacity i now urge you all strongly to 
nonsense just bad press all the deaths that occurred inside  my own father's included  all perfectly normal fatal accidents
you will never know until you walk through that door
i lied the house is alive and we are all gonna die
a cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 930 tomorrow morning  i think the power of the house fades at dawn
 well let's hear it for small miracles 
 but i imagine we will all be mutilated beyond recognition by then
hell no the house will kill ya
left goddamnit
thefourth of july

it is a thousand years old  we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage  the sucker will pop
no prob i will just hop down the hardware store 
 no the basement  the room with all the controls to this thing big long iron levers just lying there 
 not a chance  there's too much weirdness down there i do not think even bullets are gonna stop
you are starting to sound like pritchett
 that is the fact bud 
 where the hell were you
 listen to the man 
back where
let's try down here
maybe there are notes or drawings of this place showing how those plates work
better living through electricity
that is crazy
what about that other guy
it will have to do
he is dead
we are safe
for chrissake give me a hand
it is succeeding
yeah and under other abnormal circumstances i think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones
better put it on hold until we find pritchett
i do not do groups
so where is the party
i hope not
eddie moses communications attache  which translated from ancient bullshit means i work for a messenger service
how would you make your guest list price throw darts at a phone book
i am impressed i do not think evelyngs ever said those words to anything with genitalia
i am not laughing steven
oh i think we are going to have several
then who are they
you tell me i do not know how you managed to hack into my mac but bravo
what are you talking about you think i invited them
sure know it was not me and if you say it was not you  then who the hell did evelyn
it you really loved me steven you would find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds
you know everything you do gets me hot
you are hurting me
i know
really well let it rip
oh nonono  much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch 
 the sadistic prick 
 in the act
only one way i can think of sweetheart
a simple leak if it is okay with you
where is she
stalking the wild poltergeist
 and who's next on your list
if i had one evelyn i think you know who would be first and last 
 oh for chrissake that is a given we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here 
 that was not my original plan but it is starting to look more attractive 
 thank you all the cards finally on the goddamn table
they were not loaded when i put them in there
well who's the damn thing ufromu
messenger just dropped it off no return address
you did not think to ask
i was in the middle of 
 being utterly fucking useless what else is new
no no it is just 
 well here's a better one you are fired
are you still fucking bhereb
my wife where were we
your roller coaster that is quote unlike any that has ever come before it
absolutely no cheap thrills a genuine journey to the brink of madness
and then what happens
i think it is something better experienced then described
i have designed and built six of these places  take my word for it everything's fine
like what this is not supposed to be happening
maybe if i 
alright mr pritchett let me just sign the damn thing
sorry pritchett here you go
 my loss 
 even if i give you a million as well
would not know what to do with it all 
thank god  i was afraid i would be lynched without a quorum
i am
you are forgetting my lovely wife she is part of the same winnertakeall as the rest of you
what are you talking about
very good well i think i can say with complete honesty i have never heard of any of you
i will try not to remember to warn evelyn
something with the power i do not know
i think i will do what i damn well please
i never saw you 
not just yet would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why i ended up here in the basement
well i cannot sweetheart
 confirming everything we already know 
 i will take the chance come morning and cops i will be proved right 
 no more 
do not think so stay the fuck back
please i need your help
not even for a million dollars mr price
evelyn go stir your cauldron or something for a sec
dummy 6 keeps losing his arm
so disengage his flail arm mechanism and just make him a screamer
the lockdown thing
i mean not that it did not give evelyn the kind of coronary i had in mind just
 it was not me
rewind that
i was just sitting here  it happened i had nothing to do with it
then who did
no idea i did not even know the damn thing still worked
it works
maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart
no somehow  i do not know how  she did it
pretty amazing feat all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time
do not take your eyes off her for a second i think she just declared war
 guess we know where mr price is now
he must have beaten us all here
i cannot comment until i get paid
that is going on
well then how about maybe we call someone
has not been a telephone in this house in over 60 years
why not
accumulated evil festering for decades  but i am a drunk so do not listen to me
blackburngs dead
excuse me
he would have been back by now
he must have unsealed the room
how he is supposed to be dead
melissa it is sara  is that you
 something horriblei do not understand 
you say you saw some activity here
that is the matter
these records only go back to 1880 but  wait a minute
what was her name
it might have been her mother
we do not have proof of that
suppose not
what will they tell you
i will be able to do a search to find out who lived here previously  and who died here
so was i  the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not
well i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us
yes  it was
why do not you pass me your plate
a few years older perhaps
how is your arm
i am sorry
there's no need to be
that poor little girl

we blow up space shuttles for breakfast  you and your friend alex would be a late afternoon triscuit
if you do anything to my friend
tell me about it
thank you for waking me
she was very sick and then she went mindless miss
we will see if we cannot make her well alma you and i
a puffup i call it  but miss jessica always says brioche
doctors and nurses can only do so much alma  they cannot cure everything
doctors that are people cannot cure everything
what do you mean  doctors that are people
there are other doctorsyes other doctorsbetter doctors
that is nonsense alma
no  she was mindless but not like miss jessica  but the houngan cured her
are you trying to tell me that the houngan  the voodoo priest  could cure mrs holland
you mean a figurehead
if you say miss  if you say
i am afraid so
use your influence with paul  ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table
i have no influence with mr holland
try it  you may have more influence than you think
you have never said anything about voodoo before mrs rand
have not i  i suppose i take it for granted it is just part of everyday life here
you do not believe in it
a missionary's widow  it is not very likely is it
i heard the servants talking about someone called mama rose they said she had been mindless
wait do not draw any conclusions let me explain
but mrs rand 
i asked you to let me explain it is a long story  and not an easy one 
that is sweet of you mrs rand
you must betsy they will have to believe you
i have never heard of a cure
is this disease common in the tropics
thank you
i would have stayed anyway dr maxwell
at the memorial hospital  here in ottawa
a year's contract  a trip with all expenses paid  that is not so bad you know
but it is so far away
that is rather nice is not it
no  she just runs the place she is everything else  amazing woman mother  you will like her
i like her already
and that   is my chair  and this   is miss connell  who is beautiful
thank you  but who sits there 
my brother's wife
i went to school in buffalo  paul went to school in england
i wondered about your different accents  i am still wondering about your names  rand and holland
mr holland
yes the redoubtable paul  he has the plantation and i as you must have noticed have all the charm
i do not know  he spoke to me last night on the boat i liked him very much
ah yes our paul strong and silent and very sad  quite the byronic character perhaps i ought to cultivate it
it will wait
it is my day off
but what in the world can you do with a day off in st sebastian
i was just beginning to wonder are not there shops restaurants and things
by a curious coincidence it is my day off too
it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum
what in the world are you talking about  six ounces  
higher mathematics  two ounces to a drink  three drinks six ounces
how do you know there's two ounces in a drink
did you hear what he sang
that is right  he is playing the noble husband for you is not he that will not last long
i would like to go now rand  would you mind taking me home
of course wes
not to a nurse  sleep is a cure
but she is not dead wes
you know what she is  that is death  no mind no senses  no love no hate no feeling  nothing
please wes do as i ask  you must rest you must sleep
you read my thoughts mr holland
yes thank you
no thank you  tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work
a woman crying  no one's been crying here
i am not sure i can make you understand  you know what this is
a figure of st sebastian
i am not a frightened girl
that is hard to believe after what happened last night
nothing  really  but you must admit it is an eerie sort of place  so dark 
surely nurses are not afraid of the dark
of course not
i am sorry
mrs holland must have been beautiful 
many people thought her beautiful
and charming
i have never given it much thought
do not  it will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness
good morning
well i had a good time up to a point
wesley can be very entertaining
yes he can  but i have been wondering  you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table 
i have no sympathy with people who cannot resist temptation
i often do
i do not know  i wanted to help you and now that i am here i do not know how
did not i  i do not know  that is the simple truth of it  i do not know
i imagined this so differently
instead  you come with sympathy betsy and a generous heart do not forget that  do not call it nothing
help me how
i took mrs holland to the houmfort  i thought they might cure her
because you wanted to give my wife back to me  why should that mean anything to you
you know why  you saw it the other night at the piano  you turned away from me
what i saw the other night i did not dare believe betsy 
she was beautiful
i hated her
i have no defense  so far as i know  it is true
no  it is not just how i felt toward jessica  i have been cruel to even you
the night you came to me in this room  to comfort me to help me  i turned you away
do not paul  do not doubt yourself  do not make me doubt you
i remember words i said to jessica  words mixed like to poison  to hurt her to madden her
that is past  that is over and done with
i guess i will wait until i am home mrs rand
this is something else  they are curious  curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture
i am quite sure nothing will happen doctor
it is more than that doctor  i have entered into their ceremonies  pretended to be possessed by their gods
it is a hard decision to make  but yours is only a technical responsibility
no  it is about mrs holland  a result of our discussion the other day i am afraid
what about her
in view of all the circumstances the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation
investigation of what
of the nature of mrs holland's illness  and of course the events which led up to it
in other words i am on trial
i believe there's a kinder name for it wesley at st thomas it is called the institute for mental therapy
it does not matter what you call it i can tell you right now jessica is not going
foolish  tell them how foolish it is paul  tell them
dr maxwell has very unpleasant news for us
are you going to lie for him mother
betsy tell them about the houmfort  tell them what you saw there
gotcha george not a problem tomorrow hey you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself

oh wendy

i am sorry that was stupid of me i did not mean to be so rude

communist viet cong
they left it in the jungle
one more shot
that is nice are you drunk
i do not know how do i know
i do not know either you spin around when you lie down
she is in her room
you collect these to sell abroad
why do not you stay here tonight get a good sleep you can return to your command in the morning
drunk again
he is dead i want the general to see him
or even spirit messages from the next world
in case you do so would you 
he will not even know you are there he is delirious
all the more reason to watch him he is had some wild notions lately
thank you i will do that good night
i have lived long enough to doubt everything  which is to say i believe everything a little
very well i will wager a dinner
i just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you
my friend  what can one say 
i must meet him with laughter  with songs and laughter  to show him i am not afraid 
but why
i will get ida to make up your bed
that is impossible i told them jacks died of a sudden heart attack probably brought on by over drinking
did your servant got word to dr drossos
maybe you are right help me get something to carry her downstairs
that was my companion she sings little peasant songs quite nicely  a completely untrained voice of course
of course tomorrow perhaps before i go
how could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here
thank you
sleep well
i think not
i think she went to bed  i saw her going toward the house
on my word that is what they believe
sharp shiny teeth  and they creep up to your bed 
closer and closer  until they bite into your throat
poor cathy 
last night dr drossos  today you or i  oh no oliver it cannot be you i could not stand it
if only we could get away   you and i the others are strangers they mean nothing to me
i am so ill i am so exhausted  i almost do not care
some village in the mountains  alethera i think
she has never mentioned her family
how old is she
i was looking for you
no that is thea's bed miss wollstengs bed is in there
they shall not hurt you
and the soldier  he looked at me so strangely  who is he
thea is an orphan
what an odd question
i mean does one love a father because he is good and kind or just because he is one's father
why i love my father because  because i do of course he is nice to me
what is it  what are you talking about
you have forgotten my last name
my last name is pherides
the general  you do not even know him
that should decide it or you 
when i close my eyes i see miss wollsten i cannot think of anything else
she is dead  at peace
it was the plague
whet do you mean
you and your mysterious illness a new attack everytime you are crossed  everytime you cannot get your own way
how do you know what my father thought  
did not you but now  what are you thinking now
mr davis seems a good prospect young handsome sympathetic  ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you  
what if he is
you are planing something cathy but i will not let you  i will warn them against you
you will not say one single word i know your secret
that your father and i 
you have been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against thea
really this is idiotic
you would not tell that 
would not i
this is dr drossos chief medical officer of my division
i do not care who he is he does not know	he cannot tell 
he is dead enough god rest his soul
i do not want to be buried alive if i die i want to be sure  quite sure
if you should fall sick we will be careful you need not worry
no i want more than that i beg you general make sure drive a knife through my heart  anything
you ask that of me you are afraid to live in your coffin you know what that means
her name is thea
miss wollsten  my secretary she would know
she is not too well
what is her illness
nothing really she is been under a great strain  the journey  the battle 
was she ill before that girl came into your household
why  no not before thea came 
i heard the same sound at ladysmith at nukden port arthur  what do you expect after a battle
there's no one there  nothing but the caves and the dead
i will only go as far as the shore and wait for you
maybe you have got the wrong crypt  after all it is twenty years when you wore last here
oh now  now look here 
i cannot understand that
it is not necessary to understand we are leaving and i am thankful
we have no time for that
plague there's no possibility of that is there
the rider on the pale horse is pestilence he follows the wars
but the war the army  they need you
better no general than one carrying the plague
we still do not know that it is the plague 
dr drossos will tell us we will know what to do then
if she looked like thea she must have been beautiful
in a way  this girl thea you must stay away from her
i had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why
you are my friend
listen to what i say 
when you make sense i will listen
come  you will feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island
i shall not leave the island 
she was born before your wife returned here to die you never knew
i do not know everything's so mixed up 
everything's so simple i like you
sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way i am afraid of him
you see thea believes it too
the general threatened me
well tell him

deputy brody will take care of it personally
he is smart dr grant and he knows so much about dinosaurs
this is how you play god
one way to find out
what is it
a bird cage
it is truly whats the word inspiring
from what i understand it is pretty much whatever we want
that is a bad idea
do not worry honey we will circle around and come back
twenty twentyfire pounds i have been swimming at the y
you hate to swim
people change
so do you
well we should split up or something we can cover twice the area
no dr grant says
dr grant says this dr grant says that
well that is the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him
because dr grant is not looking for eric dr grant is looking for the coast
fineand when the tricyclatops comes after you do not come crying to me
oh do not worry about that
just drop it paul
i filmed this the morning they left
no it is
i know you liked ben i had no right to
its not about him it is eric he is alone out here somewhere our baby is all alone
we have to help him
when did you have it last
i do not remember
never had a doubt never did us kirby men we stick around huh
we are not going anywhere i promise
i am trying that thing took him down this way
you could not have made that jump
i should have tried it should have been me on that beach back there not billy
how would you have helped eric  he needs you paul he needs us
he could have died
but he did not and neither did you and i am glad about that
you mean it
i do it is worth another shot and who knows things might turn out differently
i would completely support that
how low
who's that
he is not a kill he is still alive
what about eric and dr grant
going to the coast was alangs idea if he is alive thats where he is headed
what about eric
where is it
just hold on
i know i know i want to look for him too
then we should
i did not know there were two islands
thirtythousand i think closer to the top
about a thousand feet above it actually  most mountainclimbers remember how tall that mountains were
they set a trap  they actually set a trap
i thought you were an expert
dr grant was
we will be broke in four weeks
three weeks i had to rent some equipment
they are here
it was this strap alone that saved my life got caught on a rock as i was falling
reversedarwinism survival of the most idiotic
mr and mrs kirby if you look out the right you can see
i do not think so
obviously a superpredator  suchimimus that snout
they never got that big
i do not remember that on ingengs list
that is because it was not on their list who knows what else they were up to
we should take it with us to signal any planes
ah yes the first rule of academics publish or perish
alan i want to tell you that i am so sorry about the
billy i cannot talk to you now
sorry alan it is been six years
really  what do you do there
raptors mostly
my favorite
i try not to
to a degree we never imagined
the last of my breed
let me know if i can help alan youre bad about asking for help but please ask me anything anytime
okay goodbye ellie
goodbye alan
alan do not be afraid to evolve
in costa rica
on the island
you would be surprised what people can do when they have too
which one do you prefer
the first one before you where on the island you liked dinosaurs back then
back then they had not tried to eat me
any weapons radios
it is a wonder you are not i am amazed eric i barely lasted 30 hours you lasted eight weeks
the important thing is we both made it that is something we have in common
a raptor claw i use to have one a fossil
mine's new
are you sure
no although i have studied them in the wild
you should
you are right
no i could not see
do me a favor go back to your parents for a minute would you  they look worried
no we are not
the population will stabilize eventually they will adapt to fit different roles
i guarantee it will be worth your while
this plane can not land
establishing a perimeter making it safe these guys are really good one of them was a green
i have never been on this island
sure you have you wrote that book
but you never came across just one
last time i plugged it in i suppose why
just a little bit too much i think
how do you mean
it certainly does
no  i feel something
light and strong light and strong sure why not it is only impossible god save me from academics
you are an academic
former academic  now i actually make things  i do not just talk
you think i am all talk eddie
it does not matter what i think
is there anything we have forgotten anything at all
because i did not know  i do not have the faintest idea what they are doing here
it is the lawyers  the lawyers are finally killing me
they do have motives  why did you want to see me  your message said it was urgent
what are you talking about
so what
humidity i know  highest lead density on the market
is that who we are really working for  gene splicers
everyone keep your voices down
i want to see the nesting ground
not without a shot of the nest
dr malcolm  the world  owes you an apology
that does not say a thing about trex they could have been rogues  robert burke certainly thinks they were
we have got to see one to find out is there any 
kelly  what are you doing here
i cannot tell you  but i will be back within a week
my vacation is over in a week

which one
you know at the bus stop  with the hair
that was about a year ago
well is he
no  richard talked to his parents
that richard
out of the question  you would miss the gymnastics trials  you have been training for that for a year
you like to have kids you just do not want to be with them do you
because you said so  maybe nobody else believed you but i always did
where does it say that
on the side of that one truck
exactly what john hammond wanted us to do
i am fine i am fine i was scared i thought you are you okay
i am fine i am fine
what  why
you heard his dieter  find a new spot  and remember we are after herbivores only  no unnecessary risks
to collect my fee
forty yards  less maybe  i assume it will take a slug in the brain case to bring him down
why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill
rex will not be any different  it will come
you have broken its leg
is not it obvious
the velociraptors
operations building  far end of the street
it is just fed  it will not attack unless it is threatened  do not move
let it go peter  the animal won
you version of it
there are no versions of the truth this is not a corporate maneuver it is my life
we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries
it was a payoff and an insult  ingen never
do not start a legal argument with me this island is not your property and neither are these animals
oh god
you are going too
she is nuts
oh my god
you cannot stay kelly that is it it is too dangerous
our chance to do what
so do it a favor and put it out of its misery
no  get in the car before they hear us
what do you think they want
i do not know
where is kelly
she is with sarah
we are sure as hell not going back out there
this is singlewall construction it is just a shack
it will hold
for sixty seconds maybe  look at this  you could
i have to find kelly
i think she is with sarah
damn it be sure
look  sarah
that is that
why did you come here
so that others would know about this place
why should they
because it exists
it will still exit if they go on not knowing will not it
yes  and people will live in the absence of truth
so the truth is more important to you than your life
four counting the one in the chamber
do not let it out of your hands again  can the kid walk
i am her father
funded by whom
john hammond
it has to be temporary something that will break apart and fall off as the animal grows
think fast sarah
current evidence seems to be to the contrary would not you say  give it to them
are you insane
i swear to god it works with lions sometimes  there we are  your baby is free 
i was a cameraman for nightline for six years been freelance since '91 do a lot of work for greenpeace
that must be interesting  what drew you there
women  about eighty percent female in greenpeace
very noble of you  you do not think you are bringing that thing onto the island do you
you think this is all a joke
he does not need a friend he needs a shrink
i believe in him
oh no
ian nothing we observe will be valid if we are trailing along in the wake of an army
i am trying
where is ian
you go if you like but we are not waiting for you  move it out
can the kid walk
runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait
stop the program  stop the program
it is not worth taking the chance john
so how much for our first tour  two noshows and one sick triceratops
it could have been worse john  it could have been a lot worse
well nedry said a few systems would go offline did not he
what now
fences are failing all over the park  a few minor systems he said
find nedry  check the vending machines
the monitors are failing
where did the vehicles stop
i ran a key check on every stroke nedry entered today it is all pretty standard stuff until this one  
what one
uh   about two million
two million   great  that would help  oh good that will take no time
wait a minute  what exactly does this mean
yeah again in  theory but  
no trick to it  just stop running the program  leaving them unattended
about thirty seconds
remember   viable embryos  they are no use to us if they do not survive
how am i supposed to transport them
mr nedry mr nedry  the embryos have to be back here in san jose by then
i got an eighteen minute window  eighteen minutes and your company catches up on ten years of research
uh   anybody else think we should not be out here
anybody at all  feel free to speak up
six weeks
these are dilated  take a look
they are  i will be damned
that is pharmacological  from local plant life
are you sure
pretty sure
there's only one way to be positive  i need to see some droppings  i have to see the dinosaur's droppings
you will not be able to miss them  cannot miss them
come along  i know my way around a kitchen  come along
oh my god
could i have a tissue please
oh my god
give time they will out draw the trex  guarantee it
they will all be fine  who better to get the children through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert
good  keep going now  the cable will terminate in a big gray box
they died together
the taphonomy sure looks that way
if they died together they lived together suggests some kind of social order
that is good  that is right  they died around a driedup puddle  without fighting each other  this is looking good
yes  good shape too  five six feet high  i am guessing nine feet long  look at the  
yeah i know you knowkids  you want to have one of those
cheap cheap cheap
they smell
oh my god they do not  they do not smell
they do smell  some of them smell babies smell
alright the one on the airplane had an accident but usually babies do not smell
they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous
the what
the cretaceous
anything else you old fossil
yeah plenty  some of them cannot walk
it frustrates me so much that i love you that i need to strangle you right now
uh this is our paleobotanist dr ellie
small versions of adults honey
what kind of park is it
the   agility  you are right
say again
we were right
how did you do it  how did you do this
we are out of a job
cannot we see the unfertilized host eggs
it is my favorite
i know
not just every six weeks
yeah i know
  the undigested state of the berries because it is  
  totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern  
  like birds  what happen is they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs  
  a gizzard  
  which is called a gizzard and it helps them mash their food but what happens after a while  
  what happens is that after a while the stones get smooth every six weeks so the animal regurgitates them  
  barfs them up  
  and swallows fresh ones
i will just finish  yeah i want to finish
yes unless they figured out how to open doors
you cannot hold it by yourself
ellie get the gun  try to reach the gun
i cannot get it  i cannot get it unless i move
the other car
i do not know
that is that
you cannot just stroll down the road you know
stick to my heels
i can see the shed from here  we can make it if we run
why not
because we are being hunted  from the bushes straight ahead
like hell it is
i get ah  
i know it is very exciting
and scary
and scary
when people try to control things that it is out of their power  
it is antinature
dinosaur eats man  woman inherits the earth
i am still not clear on chaos
  on your hand the amount of blood distending in your vessels imperfections in the skin  
oh imperfections
microscopic   never repeat and vastly affect the outcome  that is what
please   chance it
must go faster it is getting closer  must go faster
faster  shit shit shit faster
that will  it would be a first man and dinosaur all die together  johngs plan 
yes  it is not a criticism by the way
hola bienvenido
he sends his apologies
why not
because he is like me  he is a digger
what are we looking for
i cannot believe we invited ian malcolm
people were getting bloody noses   things on your head   aneurisms  
in a box under my seat
are they heavy
and the concrete moats and the motion sensor tracking systems  donald dear boy do try to relax and enjoy yourself
no we do not have any animatronics here  these are the real miracle workers of jurassic park
relax donald relax  they are scientists  they ought to be curious
that is conservative of course  there's no reason to speculate wildly
i have never been a rich man  i hear it is nice  is it nice
hey  where are the brakes
oh yeah   great
whichever one you are
triceratops was a constant browser and constant browsers would be constantly sick
tim are you okay
i am stuck  the seat's got my feet
tim i will come back for you  i will get lex out first
that is okay  listen give me your hand
yes it is
this is impossible  how am i goingi cannot make it this isit is about fifty feet
so am i going to help you with your foot
what if the car falls  what if the wheels fall
that is a good idea
you will probably be safe enough  on your own 
i doubt it
maybe  it is hard to say
could you guys possibly cool that for a  
i do not know  what do you call a blind dinosaur
a doyouthinkhesaurus what do you call a blind dinosaur's dog
you got me
a doyouthinkhesaurus rex
it is so strong  look at its nose  need help

amphibian dna
tim you are gonna have to let go  i am going to count to three
you are crazy  i am not gonna jump
tim i am right here  easy catch  easy catch  count to three
try to
not without massive sequence gaps
you have no idea
to ellie you will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything
me  oh hell yes  three  i love 'em  i love kids  anything at all can and does happen
occasionally  always on the lookout for the future ex mrs malcolm
you have not touched  did not touch anything  we are stopping  we have stopped
i must have touched something  this happens all the time it must be my fault  machines hate me
machines hate you
yeah they hate me
you want to talk about this
the kids okay
well i did not ask  why would not they be
kids get scared
that is to be scared about  it is just a little hiccup in the power
i did not say i was scared
i did not say you were scared
i know
when you gotta go you gotta go
you are sure
we gotta do something
what  what can we do
there's gotta be something  
for today i guarantee it
and who in god's name do you think you are
john hammond  and i am delighted to finally meet you in person dr grant
i could compensate you by fully funding your dig
  this would be an awfully unusual time  
for a further three years
the brachiosaur  thirty
sorry  it is kind of a ride
let's get outta here
after careful consideration dr grant   so have i
dr grant  dr grant
let's get you out
that is not what i am going to do  good
i am trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain you know
it is safe
it is safe
go  that is the way we are going to go  what do you say
no i did not hear anything  no we are okay
oh i hate the other kind
they are just doing what they do  well the other kind      just do what they do
i guess we will just have to evolve too
i will stay awake
all night
all night
it is okay  it is okay  it is a brachiosaur
you are a beautiful big animal
okay  keep low  follow me
timmy  the power is coming down quick
timmy let go  you are gonna have to let go  count to three  i will catch you

i am coming up there tim i am coming to get you  lex i have got to get him
phone security systems everything works  you ask for it we got it
codswollop  ian you have never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island
i certainly have  very clearly  because of the behavior of the system in phase space
john john
do not do that
dr grant dr sattler  you have heard of chaos theory
wait a minute  what do you mean worked  everything is still off
you are right john  you are absolutely right everything's my problem
i will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you dennis  i really will not
i do not think there's been any debate  there's no debatemy mistakes
i do not blame people for their mistakes but i do ask that they pay for them
thanks dad
i will keep an eye on it  maybe it will swing south like the last one
ray start the tour program
tell them when they get back to the cars
thanks steve
thanks for the presents
we love the presents
turn it off lex  turn it off
why did you do this
i do not know  i am sorry
what if we fall  i hate trees
they do not bother me
yeah you were not in that last one
they are not monsters lex they are just animals  and these are herbivores
that means they only eat vegetables  but for you i think they would make an exception
that was great
i am afraid i am gonna fall
shut up  you are scaring me  stop  you are scaring me
really how much
ken we have been through this
do not tell me you are still thinking of buying casa de psycho
you want to put in chain saws
no no listen when i get back to new york we will meet with the board
do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninetyeight percent in the last ten years
no but
and do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks crystal lake is filled with corpses
that is not true
logging we will need an environmental impact study for that
i do not think you are getting in the spirit of things janet we will buy whatever studies we need 
just a deer mister biller part of the local wildlife
get rid of them
you have a map
you learn something new every day let's go
mister biller now that we can see the lake i think we should follow the shoreline to 
help me with this
i really think we should go back
i want to look at the rest of the house
this is janet davenport  i am the realtor
where is ken is he all right
what about that other guy
other guy
yeah ken said there was another guy there _big_ guy then he dropped the phone that is going on

janet goddamnit that is going on
jas jason voorhees he is here
that is my job
and we are in the center ring  you sure you want to wear that blazer
your client is being booked right now he will be in cell five
what are the charges
compared to this guy amateur
who's chest
jasongs it came out of his chest a hand with long blades on the fingers
video store
because everyone knows he is guilty
wrong jason cannot get a fair trial because of _these_
i do not know if anything's going to work in this case therefore we have to try everything
this is a legitimate cinematic genre just like westerns comedies film noire science fiction
a seminal film first ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement
great is that what you are going to say when i put you on the stand
insomnia not unusual for someone in his situation  not to mention he is a bedwetter
he wets the bed
i always throw that in it makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant
this sexual obsession of yours have you considered going into therapy yourself
no need i am selfdiagnosed i have severe nympholepsy  and i am a bedwetter
that did not sound very convincing
wait a minute let me see that she hands him the file
insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes delusions
how do we prove it
cute waitresses
that is open to debate
i will take my chances come on i am buying
he is my client and this is important enjoy your waitresses
me too i am drunk
well i am onto something more useful  you ever hear of a man named fred krueger
yeah what is it
_it is a second rem pattern_
that does not make sense
add it to the list
so what do we do
tomorrow if you can clear it with the sheriff's department
checking out a theory just keep talking to him
how is that possible
i do not know but i think he is pissed
great now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose
i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid
think it will do any good
and if he is not
then we are all in a lot of trouble
ten cc's of this shit and you will not be dreaming about anything
how long will the effect last
about ten minutes
ten minutes
if i give you a bigger dose it will give you a heart attack
for the moment you have only got about two minutes left hurry ruby takes off towards the cineplex
my client is dead  but i think he is a free man
arlyn he just wanted to ask some questions  something you could help us about

i do not love him
do you always have to repeat
look  could i use your phone
yes indeed
look i almost killed my  i almost killed someone
well i am certain doctor spangler will want to talk with you excuse me
oh well that should not take you more than another oh two and a half or three years should it
a few more days we know who did this
so do i
no not grunemann he is dead the man that killed him  also prob'ly jane mckenna also arlyn page
now there's a picture i would like you to 
you said someone killed them you said you know who you said that
well we are pretty 
why is not he locked up
we do not want to just lock him up we want a conviction we wanted him to do something more
is that why klute did not tell me
i guess he figured it was better
what was better i made better bait
no that is not 
here please
like for you to look for the man
grunemann i have looked at him a 
 we can talk 
yes  jane mckenna's book  i could make a phone call
no you are frightened you are pretending well  klute knows about me then does everybody know can you tell me
will you let me go then
excuse me miss daniel
i said yes i see
oh no i do not think 
tell me i will listen  i just want you to tell me
miss daniel my name is klute  john klute 
my name's john klute
you said that
i am an investigator i would like to ask you some questions about tom grunemann
dew yew hayuv ahdentifikyshun
no i am look 
or you will get me shoved back in the brig you mean another month with the bulldykes
is not that sweet  well it could be any one of them bubi i get to see them all
what  what do you remember about that  dumper
i cannot say he was anybody
most of them
is that how you met the dumper  someone else gave 
how would i remember
how else do you meet them pimps 
you are very square pimps do not get you dates cookie they just take the money
look i am sure this will amuse you too ilia trying to get away from all that
what about the old gentleman the other night mr faber
tell me about frank ligourin
mm oh he was my old man we broke up
i do not want you to look up there's someone on the skylight
i go on rounds
rounds what are they  do not watch me keep talking
what do you think
cannot you get him
maybe if you tell me the things you have not
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper  frank sent me on it
do you know where he got the dumper
he never told me
well let's go down and ask him
is that what you gave him
it did not go anywhere  but that is not why 
about the dumper did not he tell you that
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper
well  she is dead
you said you wanted these
you told me what you could i guess i am through with your part of it
is there anything more i could 
i do not see anything do you
what are you gonna do next
try some other ways 
what do i do meanwhile  wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me
and i do not think that was tom
you said it was
no i said what did you think
yeah you got to me
 us city folks the sin the glitter the wickedness
oh no not that way i would say it was more  i do not know    too bad pathetic
it got lonely upstairs there's someone on the roof
not much point to this is there
did she and jane mckenna know each other
frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his traveltime
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too
what the hell do you think's the matter  i could wait for you someplace
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann 
 then you do not need me
but if it is someone else i do
what if i go out on tricks  you wanna come along you could sit and read the national geographic
how can you do it to yourself
i do not get you
ligourin how could you do it
i told you before you would not understand
no you can find some other way  explain it to me bree show me any sense to 
what am i supposed to say
i was wondering what that was
hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life
do not touch anything
drop it
my god i thought it was over and here i am daddy right back at the start
go down in my room
you said it was over right you said not to worry any more all over right
those were police laboratory people they have been over the apartment
oh zippidydoo they will find my fingerprints  can i go in i need some stuff
with trina
i called trina
maybe i was not there when you called
bree that is actually happened it was not that bad
how do you know how bad it was
why could not you stay here with me
because i did not want to be touched i did not think you would get that
trask wants to talk with you
trask said i should move let's not make a thing of it
no i was going to come up i wanted to ask you to marry me 
you wanted to or you are
i am
you could at least look at me
about what
they do not scare me any more
can you use these
no i am sore
i believed her pete
it is where it does not get me i have got nothing left that connects to anything
then close the case
i better keep looking
where how
i could try arlyn page again she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer not tom you said the dumper was clearly not tom
it is got to make sense some way
how is it back there
well there's a couple 
yeah two things pete that 
you said trask was arranging laboratory work police laboratory anything from that
yeah it was not tom
i am sorry i do not understand
it was not tom that broke in the room
it has to be tom you said he ripped up his own pictures he 
no no mistake pete it does not prove who it was  but proves it was not tom
you must be discouraged
not too bad this brings back that dumper in the picture
that who
dumper the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew
you said he was no possible connection with tom the page girl told you that not tom
someone's been doing all these things
you were hired to look for tom not someone
pete i have got a chance to buy jane mckenna's black book
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckenna's list of clients
no it is ridiculous this has nothing to do with tom grunemann
tomorrow evening nine east river drive and 73rd street
suppose i meet you there a half hour before
just send me a money order
no i would  like to be in on it
i will be sending you on a report tonight
it is a beautiful day in tuscarora  i do not envy you that humidity in the city

have you discussed this with them
it is in the report
do they have the report have you discussed it with them
i wanted to give it to you first
thank you goodbye john
goodbye pete
i have just got a few 
they tell me you use narcotics could i bring someone around to look at your arms

would i be telling you all this she copped out long ago she committed suicide baxter
not unusual
did she talk about him to you
are you with plant security sergeant
town police
then how are you involved
i know tom grunemann
you knew the subject thomas grunemann how well
we grew up together kids
can you account for his disappearance in any way
everybody's got some i guess
did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york
unknown unidentified and unwanted and there's more every day man there's more everyday
i believed her the dumper was not tom grunemann
i looked it up
i do not know it looks familiar to me
thought it might it is off an arrest report you typed two years ago man you wanted samples of everybody
unless he was involved with grunemanngs disappearance
i knew tom never wrote that letter
what else do you know
i left them here i was doing some work here
nobody's seen that

your mom knows all about the face okay  do not worry she will tell the face to beat it
will you come and say goodnight to me every night
yes your honor
i see  well you will have to do better than that  do you have any affidavits to support negligence
i do not your honor however
this is an isolated incident counselor unless you can prove otherwise
does the witness deny the injury took place
no counselor i am going to over rule you on this line of questioning
then i have concluded my questions
six years
and would you describe those years as happy
the first couple yes but after that it became increasingly difficult
mrs kramer did you ever work in a job while you were married to your exhusband
no i did not
did you wish to
yes i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer
and what is your present salary
i make thirtyone thousand dollars a year
yes  very much
and yet you chose to leave him
can you recall any particular incident that relates to mr kramer's care of his child
no questions
your honor i am only examining the mangs employment record  he pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job
while the child was in the care of the witness he cut his face badly and is now scarred
eight almost nine years
and did you have a close personal relationship
it was good  he was a hard worker a lot of drive a real hustler
and yet you fired him
mr kramer nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus
look you do not understand  i need a job  i have got a kid and
i understand and i am absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up  after the first of the year
mister kramer it is  almost four now  it is the friday before christmas  nobody is going to want to
either you call and set up the appointment or i will call  and if i call you lose the commission
my we are a hot shot are not we
how many lovers have you had permanently
i do not recall
more than three less than thirty threepermanently
do you have a lover now
ii do not know
would you speak up mrs kramer i could not hear you
we were married two years before the baby  and then four very difficult years
so you were a failure at the longest most important relationship in your life

yes holiness
where are you from
kham holiness
your people are very brave they are fighting the chinese no one can stop them not even me
khambas are wild men
do not worry holiness they fight for you they are under your protection
no cried
i know
it is alright father
can i do anything i want
are you of whom
and you have horses you love horses
i do beautiful horses thank you holiness
will you buy the sheep for me
where will you keep them
here we will collect them
i will buy them for you
can i free the prisoners
are you general
we want 2000 more tons of barley distributed
so far they do but the quantity it does not exist you will have to reevaluate your needs
it depends on the quality and that it be indian
to protect to serve you chairman mao wants you to feel that china belongs to you now
chairman mao can keep china just give us back tibet
i will not approve it
then we will begin with replacing the tibetan flag with the flag of the motherland
and we will begin with tearing it down
general chiang
we bring greetings from chairman mao
thank you please sit
i have
i have a copy for you
the sera monks have surrendered
it is calm
we did not
the united nations voted not to hear our appeal
i am afraid
i want at all costs to avoid this do we have news from the delegation in china
not yet but the governor of chamdo ngabo jigme suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to peking
he is a capable man
yes but they say he did
then we shall meet
far far away
he had been sick from the time you began growing in me we thought he would die
i miss him too
how many
yes yes your brothers are here
we do not know
true suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions birth illness grief old age poverty pain death  these are surferings
i accept it what are the causes of suffering
you could buy them
do i have money
what do you think
do you have money
i am him
not until you are eighteen
roughly five thousand men
is that big
no not very big
the regent is adding men and he bought rifles and ammunition from india mountain guns too
no this war is almost over
will we ever be in war
it is an island american territory
where is alsace
i do not know holiness
he warned about the future of tibet
tell me
when it is time
look here
ask whatever you will
what is the danger from the chinese now
so tibet too needs to define itself
yes as a free country but our attempts have proven futile we continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the chinese
can india help us
india is a newly independent nation they are struggling india is in no position to help us
and america
america we shall see
ask the chinese mission to leave our country immediately
i shall send a letter to america to the president informing him of our problem
where is that
in the americas
at this point the most likely result of a foreign pact is war
the chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war
shall we consult the protective deities holiness
i had relinquished doubt
a beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the chinese
nonviolence means cooperation when it is possible resistance when it is not
the people will not allow it
i will alert the chinese delegation you know i would never have let you go alone kundun
good day
please come in so cold
we are traveling to lhasa may we
of course please this way your servant may use the kitchen
thank you
i have great hopes for the future of our cooperation
have a sweet made in my home province the kind my mother used to make
i leave tomorrow
yes i am aware how has your time in china been
he was always nice to me he found me he saw me in his dreams
but you will always be here
i have one more piece of news a baby is coming
you decide
he does a little spot where the butter had been
is that a true story or pretend
what do you think
soft nice i have a good friend back in lhasa
i have smarter men
why is your beard so funny let me touch this
it is a story you decide
you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony
i want to run down the street i want to buy a toy eat from the shops
you cannot
i want to be a shepherd taking those goats and cows out to the hillside
but you are not a shepherd you are the dalai lama
maybe in the next life the world will not need a dalai lama
i would not know maybe
the chinese
then i am lucky i am still too young
these are dangerous times they want the dalai lama to lead them
but i have no experience
oh but you do kundun who else would be here
no holiness
am i running away
the people will cry when they learn you are gone but they would all want you safe
i will miss you
we have had fun you and i fun for a little boy in an old palace
we have
you have grown up very good
and you have grown older and your chin has grown balder
eliminate you
do you remember the day i came to your monastery when i was a baby and you comforted me
i do
i remember too actually i was frightened then i am frightened now
this is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth this is a fight for tibet
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy we have compassion for all people
these are not human beings they are worse than ghosts
how could i ever leave
it may not be your decision to make
it is possible holiness
you are unharmed
it is a difficult situation
i mean my doubt why me am i him
doubt is an affliction reliquish it accept
does he treat you fairly
much too young
i see that
oh yes
no  do you
we will not let him get hurt ma'am
you are all fuckers  vicious little fuckers
my department does not have any record of that mrs bickerman
oh well i am sorry  i did not realize you keep such a firm track of the dead
unou uiu udidu unotu  the crocodile udidu kill him though but it was all it was a mistake
nobody ulivesu on this lake  it is really uhisu lake now

usou uwhyu uareu uweu ulandingu  uhectoru

i will need any and all topographic studies
wait just a second  you do not just fly in here and start barking orders
mr cyr
c'mon we are losing light  why does the big one heckle me
and what would he do come winter
if he is eaten in the area he should not be far away  crocs hang around the food source
well you have got a croc alright they are keystone species
keystone what

deep down gut check  i am growing fond of uyouu and it is liberating to say so
what the hell are you doing
what are uyouu doing
you are crawling around like a
i am laying a spring trap
a spring trap
this could end up saving your life
that walt guy got hit underwater
no crocodile has ever
crocodiles do not sever with their teeth their molars are blunt
no thank you but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log
i used to have this recurring nightmare that i was headless
you do not want to cut me down 'cause i will kill you
i have no interest in ever looking at you hector  could you please cut me down
obviously some asshole in hong kong flushed him down a toilet
is everything a big fucking joke to you
ubiteu umyu ubishopu
it came from across the lake
he did not eat the kid cause he would just swallowed a bear
sobek  half man half croc oldest god
i am tired hector  i know this because you are beginning to not bug me
that usoundsu good but underneath it is hurtful  nightcap
then do it
you probably udou want to be killed by it that was you trying to meet your maker
so profound and fat
i see blood  maybe you got him hank
i do not know
get your big gun and guard the shore  hector  go to your tent
he never said go
get the gun
bastard bit my chopper
'cause he just ate a cow you stupid

uforgetu uitu
we both know what they will do
that is actually the easy part
you ready on shore
we are ready
you do
thirty meters or so  moving slow but straight toward elsie
can you confirm visually or just radar
radar he is underwater  but he is definitely coming
thank you jack
tranq guns down rifles up
yeah and every time we think there's no more danger
you talk to bickerman
she did not tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we would blow it is head off
womengs intuition  are there anymore
just those two
i never had sex with you
us wildlife will not send anybody without a confirmation
and what if i tranq him kelly  he drowns  you think about that
i am just saying last resort
what  oh as uifu i am interested
as if  will you miss me
are you sure
scales were oval  it was an uasianu crocodile
you think i am uthatu nuts
hector  what you just did there was at least some sort of a death wish going on
nothing's real
excuse me
unothing'su real  i am rich people are automatically my friends sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and
i am no psychiatrist  but i would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy than
can i tell them you will not go back in the water
yes  you may  but maybe i do not know
they could try to tranq him on land
they will not  he is taken human life the mission will be to put him down
we lure him on land and pump him with the drugs
you are not okay your leg's a mess
guess i finally got bit
yeah you got bit  i am gonna fix it
yeah  thanks to you
and hank  i know you were not really trying to hit him
jack wells  a museum sent you

and they are sure he did not get tangled under the outboard somehow
hank usaysu he is sure
never been to maine before
i was told they discriminate against people with hygiene  i never ubelievedu it
i utoldu you
the museum of natural history does not send out investigators to
how would uyouu know what
and even if they udidu i doubt uheu or usheu would have problems with utentsu
so i do not like tents why
you do not like tents mosquitos look at your fingernails you have about as much business being in the woods
well  you do not have to ustayu out uhereu why do not
i have come i am here i am staying unless there are ticks
there uhaveu been northern sightings but not uthisu north
usomething'su in that water
well until we see it we are not gonna be convincing too many people
adult males will charge hatchlings if there's one out there
if one could be out there why does fish and game tell me it is impossible
because they just consult their little indigenous charts
i would be able to see something
skipping stones  look how flat that water is you can get ten skips on a good one
i beg your pardon
whatever's out there udidu flip over a canoe
i am unotu staying on shore

you have a thing against museums
i got nothing against
ever even been uinu one
lightweight forward area air device unit  whatever's out there one shot with this and he is dead
and you stock these things for what to fend off russia

i do not know  it was like a tug something tugged us
i think  my hair  where is hector  where is he
other than feeling slightly embarrassed i am perfectly fine  could you cut me down

the somebody else part
yeah that part  there's somebody who's um

pleading with a crazy man with come all over my face
why does she keep repeating the name
somebody's coaching her they are trying to make him see catherine as a person  not just an object

it would be rude and he would not get to ask any more questions
he is here ardelia
not random at all maybe like there's some pattern here
what girl
the one that was weighted down where is she fred something
'cause she did not drift he weighted her down
but why he did not weight the others

you are all right where is he
get me out
shut up  the other officers will be here any minute you are perfectly safe now

but then i would have missed the pleasure of your company
sir mr crawford instructed me 
lecter has already named buffalo bill
yes sir i can find it by myself
good idea
okay mr yow
that was not me
oh my oh my maybe you better come out now miss starling
not yet  just wait for me  maybe in about two seconds
just briefly that is the problem officer
jack gordon
mr gordon did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs lippman
no wait was she a great fat person i may have seen her i am not sure
i think we may be yes
yes i bought the house from her two years ago
did she leave any records here tax or business records maybe a list of employees
good morning mr crawford
your instructors tell me you are doing well top quarter of the class
i hope so they have not posted anything
the psychiatrist  dr hannibal lecter
you are qualified and available and frankly i cannot spare a real agent right now
yes sir
it is all there sir practically verbatim
every word starling every gesture
right down to the kleenex i used  sir why is something wrong
he mentioned a name at the very end mofet any followup on her
to complete and file my report by 0800 wednesday but sir 
then do that starling do just exactly that
sir what is it there's something you are not telling me
miggs has been murdered
murdered how
he is got a real taste for it now and he is getting better at his work
maybe you have got a knack for this i guess we are about to find out
like i have a knack for dr lecter
you have not said a word today about that garage or what i found there
what should i say you did fine work we will wait on the lab
he starts this  buzzing in me in my head he makes me feel violated you used me mr crawford
they were not there get closeups
he is already offered to help what would happen if we just showed our cards  asked him for bill
what would it take
transfer to a new prison with a view of trees he said or even water can we swing that
they will use their best men but they better be paying attention
you do until six pm
but not from this angle not thinking he knew her you have got to send me
i am bureau for 28 years starling i will not disobey orders not even now
but i just became a private citizen i can go anywhere i want to
with id and a gun impersonating a federal agent is a felony
i try to be a student dr pilcher
ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer the amusing house wine
not lately but maybe someday
they live in malaysia in this country they would have to be specially raised from imported eggs
dr lecter
she died she went to florida to retire like two years ago she dies own there
i think so
you get to travel around and stuff i mean better places then this
sometimes you do
we being the behavioral science unit at quantico you are one of jack crawford's i expect
i am yes
may i see your credentials
i am  still in training at the academy
jack crawford sent a trainee to me
we are talking about psychology doctor not the bureau can you decide for yourself whether or not i am qualified
mmmmm that is rather slippery of you officer starling sit please
maybe they will catch up
i have no doubt of it
did you do those drawings doctor
yes that is the duomo seen from the belvedere do you know florence
all that detail just from memory
memory officer starling is what i have instead of view
how many women has he used our bill
five so far
all flayed
partially yes but doctor that is an active case i am not involved if 
do you know why he is called buffalo bill tell me the newspapers will not say
it excites him most serial killers keep some sort of trophies
i did not
no you ate yours
no i only hoped that your knowledge 
reasonably so yes
then please  do this test for me
no but i will make you happy i will give you a chance for what you love most clarice starling
that is that dr lecter
how did   it is nothing a scratch
why do not you ask me about buffalo bill
why do you know something about him
i might if i saw the case file you could get that for me
who can say best thing for him really his therapy was going nowhere
would not it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find
ahhh why
because you were not wasting my time
jack crawford is helping your career is not he apparently he likes you and you like him too
i never thought about it
oh a very naughty boy someone you and jack crawford are most anxious to meet
buffalo bill  bill killed him all those years ago that is impossible
they all were
mmm and what else
a moth how did you predict that
i am waiting for your offer clarice enchant me
that is just part of the island it has a very nice beach terns nest there
that is your worst memory of childhood  quicker than that i am not interested in your worst invention
the death of my father
tell me do not lie or i will know
quid pro quo doctor
clever girl you are so close to the way you are going to catch him  do you realize that
no tell me why
a cattle ranch
horses  and sheep
how long did you live there
two months
why so briefly
i  ran away
why clarice did the rancher fuck you
no quid pro quo doctor
the personality inventories would trip him up rorschach wechsler housetreeperson he would not test like a real transsexual
how would he test
i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore  or starting to tell me the rest now
no that is incidental
anger social resentment sexual frus
we do not reckon time the same way clarice this is all the time you will ever have
later listen i will 
early still dark
then something woke you what did you dream what was it
what was it
got dressed without turning on the light i went downstairs outside
yes they were screaming
so you ran away
i took one lamb and i ran away as fast as i could
thank you clarice
tell me his name dr lecter
dr chilton i believe you know each other
yes i will tell you
promise  then why not take your case file i will not be needing it anymore
goodbye clarice  you looked  so very lovely today in your blue suit
you want to see a violation this is a violation
would you doctor that would be so kind
oh and senator love you suit
no fair you lured him with produce
officer starling welcome back
we leave in the morning
yes miss
can we rest soon
duncan you are absolutely gallant if cora does not marry you i shall
let us go miss
anyone looking to pick up our trail would see it as a sign of our passing
you knew them
well that is to be expected my father
your father
chingachgook he warned me about people like you
he did
yes he said do not try to make them understand you
why did they turn back
in your particular case miss i would make some allowance
thank you so much
i do not remember them i was one or two
how did you learn english
on the contrary it is more deeply stirring  to my blood  than any imagining could possibly have been
top of this ridge fort and lake george are downhill of it
miss  may i
why i am looking at you miss
because what i am interested in is right here
what would you have me do
do not  promise me
i do not know whatever happens you stay with your father you stay among the officers
i have nothing to go back for
when how
my letter
there was none
i sent three men to webb
and by sea
you still have an aversion to the water
aversion  no hatred loathing
yes yes i will
it can be dangerous
he delivered no such message
i am sorry duncan
munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of british military interests
what the bloody hell plan is this
what are they doing to duncan duncan
we were headed
fort william henry
day and a half  where did you get the guide
colonel munro sent him he was one of our mohawk allies
he is huron and nothing else  why would he want to murder the girl
miss cora munro he never set eyes on her before today
no blood vengeance no reproach or insult
of course not  and how is it you were nearby
came across the war party tracked 'em
then you are assigned to fort william henry
no heading west to cantuckee
i thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia
then you are one of those who would allow england to fight alone while she protects you from france
do not let gratitude get in the way
that is sedition treason
that is the truth
i ought to have you whipped from this fort
major  some day i think you and i are gonna have a serious disagreement
only chance we got is   to get more distance on 'em and go to ground
do you hear me sir  if you ever fall into british hands  what white water
we do not
i do not understand
then we take the south rim down the mountain and it is 12 miles cross country to fort edward
and if we are unlucky
you will have to forego the pleasure of hanging me
 only one or two loads
your enemy
i said france is your enemy not ours

he is gonna find out
so that is he gonna do arrest us
you believe that
yeah  it is french
how much
thirtyfive bucks
tell him he can keep them the bellboy looks puzzled
have a nice evening mr d'amour
you bet
i have heard a name  someone they talk about in whispers
who is he
i think maybe he taught swann  this is me  see ya around
you heard right
you ever been married
yeah  she was killed in a car crash  her lawyer was driving she was filing for divorce
i love weird
that would have kept you out of the magic circle  which was presumably the idea  these are about nix
doorway and who's that
a nix specialty
i mean there's no instructions  what do you mean they are not tricks
what did vinovich say something about walking a path between 
trickery and divinity  yeah he says that all the time
that is because he knew  he would seen these files and knew
knew what
i am out of here man  are you coming
hey anytime  actually no  this was enough
damour  d'amour  harry d'amour
why would i do that
beats me
deep shit
i told you 
all right  it was
i know him  i saw him
he is a priest
no  he is just a guy who's got a nose for this shit  like you
he will not
what do you mean all of us
it is an illusion
do not
so tell me where nix is buried
i do not know
you will do morethan that
i swear this is the place swann told me about  the rocks
it is him it is him
it was me
why did you wait so long
i did not have the skill to resurrect him  i had to teach myself  and that took time
and you think he will be in a fit state to resurrect after thirteen years
if he was just a man like me then no  but he is not
what is he
maybe he will show you
he is with us he is with us
pimm's dead  jennifer desiderio's disappeared  they knew the puritan was coming home
pimm's dead  jennifer desiderio's disappeared
i think we make our own futures
i do not exactly know philip does not like to talk about the past
why not
and you do not ask questions
we do not share our lives the way a lot of people do
does that mean
we have not slept in the same bed for years
but obviously you still care what happens to him
we would not be having this conversation if i did not swanngs one of the most remarkable men alive
he is an illusionist  it is not exactly brain surgery
come to the show with me tonight i want you to see him with an audience  they love him
do you
you have not seen anything yet
i heard what happened  it looks like somebody murdered him
well how about some of the other illusionists
they will not tell you anything
i can be very persuasive
yes  i think you probably can  we would need to talk about your fee
i went up to the magic castle you were right  he did not have a lot of fans up there
why  because he had you
he did not have me  i told you
you did not marry him for love
that is my business harry
just curious  back to business  ever heard of a man called nix  dorothea
yes i am here  and no  i do not know the name
what about jennifer desiderio
it does not ring a bell  i have to go
okay  i will keep digging
yes  you do that
jennifer desiderio for one  she threw herself in front of a car this afternoon
why do not you tell me the truth
it was more than that i think
he was the real thing right
swann said he could do stuff yes
he taught all this to swann
some or it
too much fame  yeah i guess that would turn anybody's head including yours
i was not
what then
no it is not  you cannot help me
i am here are not i
do not be  nix cannot hurt you now
are you sure
i am sure  he is dead
i know  i am the one who shot him
and they all came
and pimm and swann  only nix was ready for them
it is okay
find valentin  find him  get him in here
hang on
you cannot
nix has got to have a weak spot everybody's got a fucking weak spot
i am here harry
i have to
i think so
you saw this
no word from d'amour
harm to whom  me  i do not think so  try him again at the hotel
i left three messages already
nix was never interested in you it was always swann
the usual  full house standing ovation  i tell them it is magic
 they believe you
yeah  remember quaid
oh god
i just saw him
sure  you want me to find out about quaid  i mean the funeral
no  i am not going near him
tapert's got nothing to do with this  he came here to get his palm read
what makes you so sure
he got up and walked
after that fall he must have broken half his bones
for now  are you planning to go back to new york
no  not yet
i think we walk a narrow path between between
heaven and hell
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real
no  i am saying they were always fake  the saints the messiahs they were just illusionists
so could you walk on water
i could reproduce any miracle that is ever been performed with a little preparation
what about swanngs miracles
i heard he was the best
if he was so good why's he so dead
oh i have got plenty
i would like to hear them
just tell me about swann  or are you too scared
he was a freak  everything he did was tainted
evil  he was evil  come on
fuck you
go away
it is one in the afternoon
what are you my mother
i need to speak to you mr d'amour  about last night
we have never met
then what do you want
i am here to offer you a job
i am going back to new york in  shit  i am outta here
have you got a job that will pay you five thousand a day
maybe i just bought it
somebody's been smoking in here for months
you could almost pass for a detective d'amour  i work for the best illusionist in the world
philip swann
you know of him
i saw him in vegas once
are you a gambling man
when i can afford to lose swanngs quite a magician
never call him that  he is strictly an illusionist
that is the difference
illusions are trickery magicians do it for real
i do not think the dead much care
are you sure
are you a believer then
swanngs wife
looking for you  i tried the hotel
why would you come here
a ticket home
yes  it is regrettable
fuck regrettable  i want to know why
what for  you need to stay busy
i like to know why things happen
why people die  give it up d'amour  go home
i am afraid she is not in
when will she be in
yeah i know
you want more money is that it
shut up
i tried to pay you off
was that swanngs idea
have not you seen enough to know that does not matter
why do not you leave this alone let everybody think it is over
we have got to get you to a hospital
do not bother
shut up  we have lost enough lives already
i am sorry d'amour
what about
 looks like you are going to lose one more
a mister quaid
she has no real grip on reality
does anybody
oh yes  we have to agree that is real and that is not that is what holds us together
and what does jennifer think's real
too late  why are you here did you cone up here for a reading
yeah  you could say that
i am not afraid to die  there's something terrible coming home
the puritan
harry d'amour
i know all the kids coming up got to stay ahead of the game but i do not know you
i am in from new york  i came to see swann
what a tragedy  it was just a matter of time of course but it is not good for the business
was he taking a lot of risks
you do not know the half of it i am walter wilder by the way
not the walter wilder
sure  vivovich
he knew swann way back  he says there were a lot of drugs a lot of crazy shit
i would love to you know hang with some of you guys
people are pretty cagey  who do you know
for what
for an introduction
well nobody
it is not a business harry it is a vocation
have you been in
they will never find out
you should not have followed me d'amour
how the fuck do you do that
now i am going to have to kill you
i do not think so  you need me alive
why  so you can fuck my wife
or murdered like nix
he deserved it
oh yeah
now that i am dead the spotlight's off her
it is me betrayed him
and she shot him i  i think that would piss me off if i were nix
i do not know what else to do
help me
will that do  no
did not know you read minds
he had something  he showed me how to bend the rules  a little levitation  a few fireworks
is that all
looks that way
nobody's better off this wav
you do not get it do you we are shit d'amour
in my time and nobody else's
at a guess they just resurrected him
you did not try hard enough
i cannot i cannot go any further
i do not know
no  i am taking a couple of weeks' vacation
you never took a fucking vacation in your life harry that is going on
i got to go  i am late
call me tomorrow
there's other guys as good as me loomis
yeah  but not as cheap  call me
a couple of weeks
one question
what about philip swann
i knew swann  he is a fucking liar
who's not
is he the puritan
yes yes
and he is dead
no  he is coming back  he is digging his way out
fuck you
you do not think i have got it to give
you want to be like that swann mud and shit
binding you
why would i want to
because you have got nothing else to live for
not true
the woman has a new love in her life  your friends are dead nobody's left to save you but me
do you think they have a room here
she is a talk show host  they cannot be charmed  by definition
it is susangs cooking claire  that is why uncle james lets them stay
it is probably trivial
i must really be slacking off  hungry
says she can get me in to see this killer
now that you are on tv you are a magnet for all the wackos out there
no  of course not  mmmm  anago  my favorite
forgot my car keys  what are you doing on the fourth floor
i spaced out
well it is a nice surprise  should i hit the stop button
what happened
when did they find her
i cannot believe will killed him
thank god he did
i do not know  in a way i am glad it all happened
like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic
it is with me all the time claire i just do not like to talk about it
well it shattered your faith in everything
i am just temporarily off my game
you need to believe in something besides yourself
i believe in you
i do not know  what are they
i found them in your file box
must be a spare set
i thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer
i found the pentacle
so you are going to kill her  put the gun down claire
you really had me going claire  i was finally ready to propose to you
we are still going to be together
peter are you okay
frustrating  form over content everything's so retro
well if peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you
yes  it is exactly
what time did you make it for
eight  that okay
quiet  real quiet
and on the day of the murders his state of mind
seemedon edge
on the day of the murders  what did the defendant request
just me
it is nothing
sure it is  if the guards did this we can file charges
not the guards  some of the prisoners are easily disturbed
you have to tell me who did it
i am gonna go make a stink  sit tight i will make sure you get a change of clothes
my secretary
you are aware that this woman was party to the socalled exorcism
no i was not actually
of course not  they put him through severe mental stress  causing this aneurysm
you know i am not comfortable with this
but your patient is legally entitled to it
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures
it is the patient's request doctor
i certainly hope you are not lending any credence to this
what did you hear
and was he in distress when you opened the door  or was he sitting here relaxed at this table
there is a medical explanation for everything that happened
you heard voices you know you did
please maya  i am trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense
if you really believe in god why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real
maya for the last time i will not tolerate these obsessions
he will  he has great faith
but bad judgement  and now you see how dangerous the consequences can be
i hope so
you have a sister in new orleans
i do not have the experience  father thomas should officiate
you ready
something he said just before
he spoke to you
yeah  it did not make any sense
listen to me peter  you cannot let the ravings of a madman disturb you okay
do not you get it  they had their 2000 years  now it is our turn
so all that bullshit about god and faith
it was perfect  the harder i pushed the more you pulled away
you lied to me my whole life everything you said everything you did
you are my son  do not you see the opportunity that lies before you
you killed my parents
i know maya but you will understand when you see this man  i really need your strength
just open the door please
father i am right here
the ark sank the sun set the ark sank again
do not worryabout the transformation maya
what do you mean do not worry
yes  we won that is right
um hm  that is right maya
so if christ won that means what does that mean father  that satan
would you like to rest miette  you must be exhausted
miette come here and relax
art sank sun set ark sank again
kelson hold on a second
thirteen  the last time can you believe it  this is how he says goodbye
you need his bloodtype  like right away
well i know he is come here before
that is his name
peterpeter kelson
you just call
i did not know what else to do
oh thank you thank you so much
as a narcissist he could not blame himself  he created the voices after the fact
peter kelson
yes and you are
i saw you on television yesterday  you were brilliant
thank you  do you work in the building you coming from the party
not pure evil  that is correct
and also that
listen i am sorry but i am running late
that there is no such thing as evil with a capital e
not the most popular opinion but yes
what if i told you i was a malignant narcissist
and i also believe in god and the devil in fact i know they exist
well by saying that you are acknowledging the existence of a higher power  which to a narcissist is impossible
i murdered my parents mr kelson  and while they deserved it i still went to confession the following sunday
well then it all seems to be working out for you  listen ms
do you remember henry birdson  the math professor who won the salwen medal then went home and killed his family
that is that got to do with you
last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed  you realize how rarely they make that ruling
i do
i think you gave me the wrong one
what do you mean
it was blank  nothing on it  you gave me the wrong one
i cranked it all the way up  nothing but hum
you are right  i must have made a mistake
i had to
and this is evil  the guy had an aneurysm and now he is in a coma
that is their explanation  you might not believe me
well why should i  alright that is your name where do you live when did you kill your parents
peter please
townsend believed just as god became man in christ  so satan will assume human form  i believe it too
if you are possessed you cannot reveal anything satan wants hidden  unless you trick him
trick him
the good outwitting the bad  it is like birdson had a split personality
you should think about getting professional help
the only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at bedford
so what
seven years  one baptism  he is your mother's only brother
i looked at the coroner's report  my father's o positive and my mothera negative
townsend he had some of father's books
the books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out
i am going to look around
i will go outside and take a look in the garage
that is theoh shit
whengs your birthday
that cannot be right  my birthday's tomorrow
i do not know  probably have a copy of my birth certificatemy apartment
that is the bible for
sometimes when i feel weak i have thesevisions
what do you mean
we are going to do this
you have to say that
that is true
i was desperate  i knew you wrote about murders  i needed a way in
maybe that is my problem
why did not you just go along with townsend  get rid of me  i would have
until it happens you are still a human being
what about after
only your body will remain  i believe your soul will be at peace  if we kill you satan cannot stay
what are these
i do not know  extra apartment keys that is it matter
maybe i should check lareaux's book it is in the car  be right back  do not go anywhere
you have to be experienced to do this just wait outside otherwise you risk killing him
that is his i do not know his 'grounding' phrase for me together no matter what
and his message was  together no matter what
not a lot
it is me  put the gun down  maya
whish the circumstances were different
maya  what do you mean
i will explain everything later  can you meet me tonight
i have filed a report with father frank
a lot of good that will do
we need all the help we can get
i have dealt with these people before maya  they are not going to help us
we will see father frank in the morning there's nothing to be done until then
alright maya  we will do it your way
you cannot back out on me now  we need to be sure
look john i am facing it
i am not waiting until it is too late
you are the younger of two
nothing you could not find out from reading the papers  and you are already wrong on one count
viznick will get off and michael's got a crush on you
suit yourself  but does this mean anything to you
what about that psychic that is his name szabo
he can see you thursday
i think it is gonna be a waste of time
the police used him as a witness in this case
i will be at bedford tonight if you need me
nice suit
lemme guess  the lottery
sometimes i can just feel the numbers
you know what they say  you have the same chance of winning whether you play or not
we millionaires yet
there were not any voices
not even from some mental illness as the prosecution asserts
well we all have a degree of narcissism sally but a malignant narcissist is dangerously selfobsessed
are you saying he is legally sane
of course
mike  oh the christening  i meant to call
yeah right  i do not know why i bothered inviting you guys  i knew you would not show
really  you know seeing these guys away from the court the facade slips you catch things
yeah yeah  i have heard it before  just be sure you spell my name right  nine o'clock
so you can see where you are going when you crawl up his asshole
he is looking right at me
i will quit maybe you should start
hey do not thank me  somebody up there likes you
how are you doing today
it is another day  i think i am alright
you got the right attitude anyway look we gotta talk

do not curse
there you go
you are the one always turning your nose up at me
no i do not
child please  ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say
because you are pushing me to be something i am not
so you are angry with me because you are standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume
oh yes  the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife
that is not it
do not tell me you are not ashamed of that because i know
i do  you never stood up for yourself ever  if i was ashamed it was because of that

must have been my cheapass answering machine  it was always messing up
figured it was something like that
what do you mean
i am tired of playing overseas  thinking about giving it a rest for awhile
a rest
yeah  basketball just is not fun anymore  you know
kyra's gone for a couple days  figured i would keep mom company
who's this guy i always see her around
darryl  he is alright kinda corny
sohow is the knee
getting there
strong enough to get you down the aisle
yeah  two weeks  i did not get to send you an invitation but if you
that is okay  i am probably you know busy
because i am kinda feeling that way too
you had a rough couple years that is all
that a nice way of saying i rode the bench
and you tore up your knee  rehab is tough
maybe go back to school
why do you keep asking me that
cause i do not get it
something was just missing
we need to talk
you woke me up to tell me that
it is not fun for me anymore because you are missing
i know i probably should have said it two weeks ago
because you do not pull this on someone who's about to get married
better late than never right
for what
your heart
so you are gonna bitch up
that is that supposed to be psychology
you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to
if i lose i will buy you a wedding present
there's so many i just cannot keep track
well can you give him this for me
i do not wanna look fast  thanks girl
just you and quincy baby  i got a meeting
with who
business folks
you just got back from a four game road trip
at one in the morning
i am not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife does not get an attitude

whose truth are you talking about
mom we cannot let something like this mess up the family
this is just about money you know that
quincy please
i mean how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's
guess i should have been telling your father
so you are gonna take the word of some trick over pop's  he would not lie
cannot should never be in a mangs vocabulary
why not
cause when you say cannot you ai not a man

if he pushes too deep into our boy's mindset he may destroy himself  what are you planning jack
could he handle a direct contact
i do not recommend it
right  what about sweating lecktor
he would know it from articles he is read about lecktor
twenty minutes max
at the end is the tail of what could be an 'r
when do they go to press
have him meet me with pictures of lecktor's books
will graham jack crawford
we got an ad order in tonight's tattler with 'sixsixsix' in it it is being telexed to you right now
read it
 wouldear pilgrim you honor me'
that is it lecktor called him a pilgrim when he was talking to me
'you are very beautiful
i have to
you are his friend jack why cannot you leave him alone
because it is his bad luck to be special
he thinks you want him to look at evidence
nobody's better with evidence but he has the other thing too he does not like that part of it
you would not like it either if you had it
no  i do not like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'
i will try to keep him as far away from it as i can
i need to talk to you about will graham

that is ridiculous  you do not even smoke
i  i got some freaky rare kind it is called largecelled carcinoma

sure  comedy  make jokes about the traffic  do impressions  maybe a little blue material
i do not swear  i  i do not do what everyone else does
but it is funny  it is a practical joke  they will get frustrated
but it is only for thirty seconds
no no no it is not sex  i mean  it can lead to sex but really it is just wrestling
i do not wanna talk about it

there's a small ledge  it is a short climb  you can make it
the agents

you could say that
because i do not like the idea that i am not in control of my life
i know exactly what you mean
do you want to know what it is
this cannot be
be what  be real
far from it
your muscles have atrophied  we are rebuilding them
you have never used them before
more important than what is when
wild is not it
i did not say that it would be easy neo  i just said that it would be the truth
for what
your training
show me
you  you are too fast
do you think my being faster stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place
because i did not think i would
your mind makes it real
the body cannot live without the mind
i think i do
no you do not  did you see the woman in the red dress
no neo  i am trying to tell you that when you are ready you will not have to
that is going on
yes  she is very old  she is been with us since the beginning
the beginning
of the resistance

but you already know what i am going to tell you
i am not the one
sorry kid  you got the gift but looks like you are waiting for something
morpheus  he almost had me convinced
i know  poor morpheus  without him we are lost  we will never find the one
what do you mean without him
how do you know that name
i know a lot about you  i have been wanting to meet you for some time
who are you
my name is trinity

that was a long time ago
most guys do
no  it is safe here and i do not have much time
right now all i can tell you is that you are in danger  i brought you here to warn you
of what
they are watching you neo
who is
it is necessary neo  for our protection
from what
from you
we think you are bugged  try to relax
easy neo  easy
it disables any electrical system in the blast radius  it is the only weapon we have against the machines
that the matrix cannot tell you who you are
but an oracle can
that is different
is it
are you worried
should i be
she told me
 right as rain
nothing  just had a little deja vu
what happened  what did you see
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it
how much like it  was it the same cat
it might have been  i am not sure
a deju vu is usually a glitch in the matrix  it happens when they change something
we have to
is morpheus still alive tank
i do not know  it just went dead
there has to be something that we can do
what choice
i am going in after him
you cannot
i have to
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out  there's no way you are going back in
morpheus did what he did because he believed that i am something i am not
i am sorry i am not  i am just another guy  morpheus is the one that matters
no neo  that is not true  it cannot be true
i am coming with you
no you are not
do what
you moved like they moved  i have never seen anyone move that fast
it was not fast enough
i am fine  come on we have to keep moving

where is it
deep underground  near the earth's core where it is still warm  you live long enough you might even see it
hey mikey he likes it  ready for more
hell yes
the oracle
they are hacking his mind
how much time
depends on the mind  but eventually it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this
what do they want
neo this has to be done
does it  i do not know  this cannot be just coincidence  it cannot be can it
what are you talking about
the oracle  she told me this would happen  she told me
guns  lots of guns
kick it in  kick it in
he is alive
you are not far from cypher
cypher i thought

a change of plans

ulrich will be about  he will look after you
not as much as you feel like hearing it
if it will make you feel any better i will not do it again
good  biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof
what are you talking about
an outbreak of ichimerai
and you are happy about that
beats fighting the flu i am here to tell you
you know that was the hardest part of having to portray you  grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes
yep  you have provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer
what was the top bid
why you going to make me a better offer
than thirtyseven million pounds  not really
somebody's been slipping you our mail come on out here you bad girl
in other words you are calling her a flake
it is that time  go
more like twotwo point two million
in any case we do not want your cash
ninetythree point four million
it is okay  she scrambled the transmission  luther continue feeding the gps her position
a mythjust a mythshould not you be checking out their countersurveillance
not at all  but how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site
oh well if that is how you feel about it
i will be damned  it is mccloy the biocyte ceo
what are you talking about
then we got'em
what manic invents  disease like that in the first place  why would he do it
there guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill
i am not ready
exactly where is she
in the building
not for seven more minutes
i hope there's a place to land
we are down to seven minutes 23 seconds
and the check's in the mall
right  just remember mates  billy baird's the name  anything you need to get move or watch i am your man
he is heading down the stairs now
i am she is
how much longer before you can reach him
five and a half minutes  he is breached the hot zone
hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one
no  should i
no  you just looked as if you did
no  just as if i would like to
oh  well  i think that can be arranged
not tonight  bad timing  sorry 
there's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad
think you are the only one who can pick a lock
i see  you are not just another pretty face
oh either way works for me
far right
 torque wrench
 this is very disconerting
hey you put me here  i just do what i am told
do what
not really  i triggered the alarm
where did you get this number  i do not even have it
listen to what
i need your help and i thin you can use mine
your help  what are you talking about
scotland yard interpol every dutch authority  i can make them go away
oh bloody hell  you are a spy
ethan hunt
well ethan hunt what is it you want to talk to me about
care to wait a decent interval
who wants to be decent
oh  wellthis is not exactly by the book
they have got a book for this
they have got a book for everything
that they are lying
you are not a liar  or you are an awfully good one  this thing these blokes pinched
i do not know that they 'pinched' it do not even know that they are blokes
so do i  sort of
of what
damn you are beautiful
that is because i am on my back
five sixhundred thousand
there's nearly 2 million in london
and six billion in the world
that is lot of people out therehow many of them i wonder are capable of something like that
sean ambrose for one
this was not what i had in mind nyah
but it is what you would like me to do so tell me to do it
i would like a little more conviction
so would i  but it is not mine to give
you have either got it or you do not  let your conscience be your guide
something like that
you can be a thief and have a conscience
someone in possession of all the facts  are you telling me i have to do this
generally i do not favor coercing someone not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands
and that is the only reason
can you think of a better one
probably that i needed him in some urgent waydestitute  in serious troublethe kind i could not possible sort out myself
well i mean it is not a total loss  it is keeping a very capable thief off the street
very funnymaybe he has heard and does not want to know  maybe he is lost interest
how can you possibly  i have got to get right on the plane  i am leaving now
you do not trust me
oh i do  but as we know i am a very poor judge of character
he is got you on qantas flight 2735  it is going to be delayed
just like old times
just like old times
just about
betting table twelve off the paddock nyah are you up to this
i will muddle through
you noticed  what are you going to do spank me
why  that is happened what did you see
ethan tell me 
how do you suggest i go about it
oh ethan
i am now  get me out of here  just get me out of here
it is going to be okay
i was not thinking  justtrying to keep you from getting hurt that is all
i guess i liedyou cannot get both of us out of here can you
no  you just looked as if you did
do not be  would not be on vacation if you did
well  you are sorry and i am sorry
why did you phrase it like that
like what
'you are sorry and i am sorry'
you gotta be kidding
you were there
then you do think it was ambrose
enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers
the question is why  what was this chimera nekhorvich was carrying
in any case you have got to recover chimera and bring it to us
in order to do that i have got to figure out how he plans to make money with it
excuse me
then makes sure she continues to see him gets him confide in her and report to you
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief
you mean it will be difficult
but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera
you mean that leaves miss hall
are not you even curious  about why she did it
no  i cannot afford to be curious  and neither can you hunt
you would like me to conduct my own debriefing
why not  you have done just about everything else on this operation
i would thank you  but i am not sure that was a compliment
and the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from ambrose
well bellerophon it turns out was only really effective against chimera
where is she now by the way  do you know
i do not  no exactly
well hunt what are your plans
not sure  some sort of vacation  i will let you know where i am going
oh you do not have to do that would not be a vacation if you did
well yes  i suppose i am a bit anxious
they are ready and waiting  you will soon be with old friends
i am with an old friend now dmitri
sorry it could not be under happier circumstances
yes he knew  just
not in time to save him
no  after you have lived with ichimerai for twenty hours nothing can save you  not evenibellerophoni
you keep calling me dmitri  you really should not
i am fine
put in the coordinates and let's get a visual  the visuals are not coming up
the satellite does not work as fast as i do
why not
right  i guess there are not many flu epidemics in the middle of summer
roger that
confirm  left jacket pocket
left jacket pocket confirmed
nyah ambrose is heading back  there's an enveloped inside 
she must still be on the property
i told her to get outta there
yeah  why else would he come back to australia  if he had them both he could sell them anywhere
i kill chimera at biocyte and he is sitting on a cure without a disease
you have got the voice print i will get us in
nyah still on the property
no garage entrance  lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol

you see that moon last night
oh right
i knew she had it
she looks like one yes she does

quiet quiet  there are ways of telling whether she is a witch
tell me   what do you do with witches
burn them
and what do you burn apart from witches
so how can we tell if she is made of wood
does wood sink in water
no no  it floats   throw her in the pond tie weights on her  to the pond
wait  wait  tell me what also floats on water
bread  no no no  apples  gravy  very small rocks

brave sir rob 
shut up
shut up  oh nobody really just passing through
i did not
bravely ran away away
no no no
i was just telling the woman how i feel for god's sake
you do not tell her majesty how you feel
i speak as i find archie
not down south you do not
i think he nearly ruptured his truss
seventy a year
not bad not bad
how about yourself
if you were looking for promotion you should have picked one of the healthier ones
she is hardly a full hamper herself
it is only grief makes her like she is
three years john  is that not a bit long to be grieving
she loved him
come on man  there's love and there's 
i am not sure i do archie
there's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to
the goodlooking one
aye  then she is obviously not got enough to do
aye but will they
john it is not your problem what she eats
but i am the only one she trusts
they said you were drunk  why do not you tell her the truth
she will think it is her fault for keeping me
i am getting dressed
you have got three broken ribs man
i have got my duties to attend to
do not be an idiot  you are in no fit state to go anywhere
she will be worried about me
she will get over it
i cannot let her down now archie
aye she may say that to you but the woman can say what she wants
you watch your tongue
come on man i am telling you what you already know
you know nothing about her
when are you gonna see it john  she does not give a damn about you
get out  out
it is a diary
be careful who sees it
what do you take me for
i cannot move to tidy
it is what the maids are for
i am not having some prattler going through my things
she needs me archie  she canna do without me she said it to my face  how can i stop now
mary taylor sir
have i seen you up in balmoral mary
i hope to go up next year
you would not happen to know what the queengs reading for recreation would you mary
louder girl
checked and locked sir
kitchen and lower house
mr brown sir 
it is cold out there tonight barney
good man  and is she all right
your royal highness  what a pleasure to see you here
have you met mr lyle  he is in sugar
i do not think i have had that pleasure
i take no account of gossip your highness
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy
of course
i beg your pardon  mama
she is busy
convey her a message
she is away to windsor tomorrow  talk to her there
tell her the prince of wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press
are you deaf as well as stupid
i said are you deaf as well as stupid
do you know who you address sir
whom you address
the future king
out of my way
no dinners bertie  why are you dressed for outdoors
it is so infernally cold in here
cold is good  is that not so dr jenner
it is a disgusting habit bertie  it should be discouraged
yes but is not midnight a little excessive
it is quite late enough
but mama the room was built expressly for that purpose  it has been a smokingroom by tradition ever since father 
not now he does not  this is my place
by whose authority
my own
back and upper corridors
i am sorry
how will i know what she requires
you will be sent a message
who will bring it to me
her highness' equerry
i need a man who knows where i am
i am sure it will not be difficult to find you
that is not good enough
aye do
in matters concerning the household i act on her behalf
yes  i do
you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it  you know that very well
i did not come all this way to sit on my arse
you will await your orders like everyone else  unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement
is that the queengs request
yes it most certainly is
that can wait till the weekend
there are important papers from 
it can wait  anything else
i believe that decision rests with her majesty
do not think i cannot persuade her
i do not doubt that the queen was highly amused  she has always had a very healthy sense of humor
this is a slur on her good name
we are all of us subject to forces beyond our control mr brown even you
a man can refuse only so many invitations from his queen  it was remiss of me not to come earlier
i am a blank sheet
do you hunt
to shoot perhaps but not to kill
if you hunt you kill
i have been called back to london  my last day  i thought i might take a walk on lochnagar
i am fine
you are injured
it is nothing
still someone must attend you  your wife should not have let you out
i am not married
i would not know
was there never ambition
maybe once
then i envy yo
i do what i do
for her majesty
i said  i serve the queen
no other aspiration
why do you think i keep her here
she trusts you john
see what
the threat  i tell them but they do not see it
they are not as watchful as you
too busy looking after themselves
the greasy pole
no loyalty
no love
for once in my life i am not the issue
she will never understand it
in time she will
she will think i betrayed her
but others will know that you acted for the greater good
aye ma'am
you are well
i am
and the pony
she is well too
i am glad of it
yes  you have a brother in service here do you not  i forget his name
yes ma'am
yes ma'am
you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so
yes ma'am
then why do you persist in doing it
and i intend to be there when she is ready
it is a fine spot ma'am
he thought so yes
aye ma'am
are they worth reading
i am told so
who by
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming
what does he know about the highlands
he has been attending at balmoral for many years
that does not make him an expert
his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject
i do not groom a horse to have it admired by others i groom it because it needs grooming
i do not do it for others  but ponsonby thinks they are good
just say what you have to say woman what other people think should not matter to you
of course i shall say what i have to say  i always do
i hope they did not go to any trouble john
ah well
to keep out the cold
i heard something
i ordered it  it is for your own safety
dear me you will be telling me to watch what i eat next
aye  but there are fenians reported on the mainland
the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated i am sure
i will decide when it is exaggerated
i was told you were in a fight
yes ma'am
has someone seen to those bruises
yes ma'am
if duty and safety are served by the same end then aye i do
i cannot believe you are saying this you who i have relied on all this time 
have i ever let you down before
 you stand there and tell me it is my duty  after all you promised me
i am breaking no promises
you are forcing me to do the very thing you know i fear most
for god's sake woman i am just trying to keep you safe
i will not hear any more about my safety  you made me a promise and now you have broken it
because i have to 
someone has to look after you  it could have been someone  it was before
yes  yes it was
not at all dean  good of you to spare the time
i came as quickly as i could
you have seen the latest cartoon in punch i take it
i beg your pardon
oh several things
indeed and for that they are eternally grateful
is that not enough
in so many ways  and yet it is your presence they crave  a figurehead
no ma'am
the cartoon or her majesty's absenteeism
well both
the question is do we need her
surely you are not suggesting we dispense
my dear stanley a prime minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion
i hope he got his mother's permission
to know when he will be king
you cannot know that for sure
it is questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction  she is never been less popular
that is her excuse this time
no she was not
dear oh dear
we think she can be dissuaded  have you had a glance at the diary
of course
some young page was boasting about having seen it  lucky
no indeed
cold is good
forgive me your majesty  in no way did i wish to suggest
i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy
the same your majesty
i did not consider it wise in the circumstances to tax your nerves
how ill is he
just them
yes ma'am
what is he doing there
he appears to be  standing by his horse
i made no request to go out riding today  how long has he been there
i do not know ma'am  he was observed earlier i believe
has he been hurt
i believe not ma'am  i understand  he would had rather too much to drink
a few days ma'am
why was i not told earlier
i am very sorry ma'am  i cannot imagine  he was certainly given no instructions
please make sure it does not happen again
of course at once
no  i shall be out walking
we were expecting you to return by six
and now i am back
i have no idea
why not
i  forgive me ma'am i am no wiser than yourself
what is it
i have a letter ma'am
from whom
from princess helena and other members of your family
my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person
they are demanding the dismissal of john brown on grounds of drunkeness
prince albert is at windsor ma'am
why is he not here
he is sick ma'am
then why are you not with him
you ordered all members of the royal family to attend you at balmoral
what is the matter with him
he has typhoid fever ma'am

well now here's a man who wants to get right to it kinda anxious to get to it are ya
what did i say
that a mangs attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be
so since you agree i guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life
how is that

there's sometimes a buggy how many drivers does a buggy have
good then but just in case that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer you understand that
i understand
you are an understanding fella

trust is earned not given away
respect is earned not given away trust is given away to anybody
i just want to double check the facts
he probably has a history of this shit
yeah maybe let's start the background checks let's see where they live and what kind of security systems
matthew lives on the upper west side kinda posh for a temp do not you think 
any priors  any police record 
checking hah  he has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets
parking tickets  that is it 
yeah but we are talking 43
a real criminal i still think that is our in what about her 
i am sick of playing i have got a better idea
for once in your life shut the fuck up
excuse me sir 
i have to say that i am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass
thank you  sir sir may i ask you a question 
of course
i am thirty two
and how much do we pay you annually 
i make roughly four hundred thousand a year
son let's watch the tape
i had suggested that they tone down the program so that the guests might take longer to expire
what do you mean sir 
what if we were to put bruce into the park as a guest 
sir he created the park he would know how to circumvent any of the traps
i am willing to bet that even the creator cannot out wit his creation
what then sir  what would we do with the park with out bruce 
do you think the assistant that is his name
john sir
yes do you think he would like a raise and a new position 
sir this is not like firing any employee we cannot predict what will happen
good sir
better sir
fantastic  a little faster sweetheart
sir  we are moving them right along as fast as we can
have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning  first thing
i am just looking for our best interests may i have the tapes bruce 
we have new guests for the park i have a file on them may i see bruce 
he is been expecting you
what did you hear 
might i ask why you no longer work for the mob 
there was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs
i thought and correct me if i am wrong but were not you trying to play both sides 
what are you looking for  a blow job 
no i am not a homosexual
then what do you want 
have you ever considered running your own park  i mean since you will not be returning to your former profession
i did not think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new park
we cannot
no i am not
i had hoped you would say that i have a proposal for you
i am listening
just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life
are not you the bitter one
we should have another fifteen minutes at least
bruce has just awaken
i do not know
he must have had a gun stashed god damn it 
we cannot afford too many surprises
he will never make it out of the park alive i promise you that
of course this one's a gimme just be patient even ol' bruce cannot outwit some of these traps
i have a turn for the worse for the team 
i do believe mr mccray will be most pleased with the tape of this one
i will see that bet
i can see your small business  look at it it is so small
shit i forgot about them well i guess the boss man was not as tough as i thought
i do not know maybe we should watch the tape to be sure
you are paying the bills
yes i think he is feeling sick or something
i can see that but where 
goddamn it bruce you have cost me about thirty dollars so far
i think i will see hat action
what happened 
the power went out in half the park
how can this happen 
yeah right he is stuck all the way over here

i am moving this book to viking
tell him you are afraid of love afraid of needing
hey handsome  brevity this
good girl

i think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you
you need a few dollars
i can be quick  i can even be funny
can you watch the road
see  dry  it is in the delivery
 you want a menage on your wedding night
uh  how about promoting a bridesmaid  someone you know for at least fortyfive minutes
the twin part  i like to remain impartial in my contempt
not you  you will not be comfortable unless you are distinctive
 you hate weddings you never go
he said that too
 just my bridal shower  and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a onethirty game
what because i am a little understand
 most sentimental schmucks i pity want a honeymoon after their wedding  just to top it off
so your honeymoon is exactly where
 his snoring yeah  he says it is worse than ever  that snaffle one
a trademark move do not touch it
but he sure can kiss
it is been awhile  i will take your word
after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults i made a command decision that changed my life
do you get nervous in small confined spaces
so it is sweet of you to be protective
let me rephrase that
but nothing ever could ever did give me a moment's pause about this marriage
do you get hysterical in small confined spa
 except one
well perfection can get wearing after whi
i was gonna predict that
you win
i have missed a step
he has you on a pedestal  and me in his arms
stop we are embarrassing h

 whatever is manly and independent
gold nose hair clippers
what you said  make it appear that he is doing you the favor
only  if he wants to
he will not get mad huh
we settled this  and i reneged that was not fair
they will eat it anyway you ever been to a walk
this must be very very hard on him
what with the psychosis and all yeah
do not you see
if you are waiting for do you take this man that is considered poor form
 that this is all my fault
i love him
why do not you just drive a stake through my heart
have you ever heard of irony
that is entirely understandable
 look good on kimberly
right  and then it did not want to come off  exactly
 well maybe it works on fingers too
it is jules you guys have not had a call from say kimberly have you
oh she is slipped out the little monkey  prob'ly with michael doing the nasty
i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question
under the circumstances  charmed to know you jules
nice meeting you too walt
i hope so  this is all too mysterious to waste on just me
i know ben
it does not say th
i told him get the important stuff kim's ring  i will collect the inconsequentials
nobody has  so far
i need to make some calls could i use your office
yeh well my old machine kept eating messages  i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement but finally
you do not understand  i have never felt this way about anybody
well somet
i mean she is a junior at chicago university she is twenty years old like when i first met you
but they are so down to earth such wonderful people
you have met her parents
 thomas yeh
i need you
dance  you do not dance  you learn to dance
such as
she is too genuine
hate that
how can you trust someone you can never mistrust
that is next
endearingly absentminded
my very point  here's another one
quite the little eccentric
at first i thought it was a gag but she is always done it
she admires  tommy lasorda
waiter check please
she finds him personable
can that kind of defect be passed on genetically
first girl i ever knew  who lets me give her a bath
till the gas ran out
hey cabs are expensive  i am cheap remember
what leaving school
i got the point
that would be a girl  i do not even know
i never eat when i am serene
you never eat when you are despondent
i switched that around when you were not looking
boy those were the days
you need a babysitter  that is what i am here for
never can tell
michael it sounds like a wonderful opportun
does it really how come you never took some sellout establishment job you had plenty of chances
like i said dazzling
you keep saying that
well you have got the rest of your lives
no  i have got you
if you like
have you
it is more than that
you have been the man in mine
except for the hot affairs we will have twice a year
except for that
me either
i will check  i have it on powerbook these days
the night we met
we danced to it  just like this
yeah kim told me they were giving you their dueling scarlet's act  actually they are sophomores at juilliard
me too  i am getting married tomorrow

tomorrow is sunday  nobody's doing business  crack of dawn monday walter will take you up there
you are right  easy come easy go
it means a lot
 maybe it is congratulations
mike the funny thing is he is offering you a gig you would be stupid to turn down
i am just tired  please put her on  thanks
maybe you should take the job and dump the girl
it is over
a bad combination
maybe tomorrow you will feel dif
i just want to be alone  is that okay
if san antonio sweeps sacramento
look i came down here to face everybody  i did not want to slink away like some coward
but the scotch salmon was so fucking good you decided to stay for brunch
she has not told anybody what am i supposed to do
get married apparently
and your point
well  how come she did not
because she is as chickenshit as you are you morons are made for each other
she admits it is her fault
love does not have to be right it just has to be love
oh yeah
i was so confused so conflicted so unstable
well it happens
 yeah that
you never want to do that see that is always a costly turnover  as they say in the sport biz
nellie fox  walter likes the past  and he likes the little guys

let's discuss it when i am unbound
do not worry about it
we are about ready to go here are you ready
let's do it
aside from the obvious
was what worth it
was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life
i am sure we will
describe mallory
describe mallory okay she is pretty she is got blonde hair two eyes two feet two hands ten fingers
well riddle me this batman how do you feel about the fact that you are never gonna see mallory again
says who
says the united states of america
when have they ever been right
could i get a coke for mickey
let me check on scott he is hurt bad
scott's dead and unless you wanna play follow the leader shut up and do as you are told

if they stay they will catch you and they do not have to catch you
no fucking way
mickey you are wasting time
you made every day like kindergarten
unfortunately yes
i do too
and a snakeeye glare
and a snakeeye glare arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him
he had the edge the mind's edge
mickey and mallory have that edge
only on a much grander scale
they have hypnotized the nation
schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along
that is the way of the world
they are shocking the world into remembering the primal law
survival of the fittest
and then mallory stops mickey and says 'hey these are the brothers hung
mickey stops sawing on my leg and says 'oh my god i am your biggest fang
apparently they have seen all our films
they were especially influenced by 'conquering huns of neptune'
so mallory calls 911 and they took off
they actually apologized
where do the air ducts lead
it is hard to say capt'n
take a wild stab
i will say enough to destroy this wing
the entire wing

how about that guy at the bank
so that is your point
just that they came out of somebody's experience is all
no faith  they came out of somebody's imagination
yeah well larry and his friends are hungry  and i did say i would try to pick something up
i do not know  i do not think so
i do not know kate
you do not have any idea
he is a podiatrist or something
why do not you ask him
why should i ask someone out who i do not want to go out with in the first place
yes you did
well i would not have if i had not thought i was in love
look how big it makes me look  i look like an alp
i think it was sweet of him to pick it out
i know  it was
larry brought me flowers last night
is that bad
i think he is having an affair
no  i can just tell
it is a coincidence
the woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence
but it is july
it is still the new year
what about your job
i have vacation time coming to me
you do not have a passport
would you stop saying that  i need you to do me a really big favor
does dwayne know about this
of course not  i told him i was going to visit a great aunt  and do not tell larry either
my god you have
you are just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets
live happily ever after
you are coming with me
gritty  is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who do not believe in deodorant
i do not know  maybe  think of it as an adventure
are you sure
yes  cathy lee crosby stayed here
well we are here  and more importantly he is here  we will cut back on everything else
you gave it your best shot  you tried
we lost him
you and the other 99% of the women in the world
he fell out
did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned
i do not think he understood what you were saying  that is the airport number
the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago right
what would you find
a butterfinger wrapper
a rich possibly fat slob
maybe there's fingerprints on it
we are not looking to arrest the man faith we are trying to locate him
oh  right
what is it
a phone message  only
only what
only it is in italian
what was i gonna do  tell him the truth
the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy
you know no offense or anything kate but i think i am starting to see larry's side of the story
that is that supposed to mean
well you do not have to get snippy with me
'course he does
larry bought himself cologne
right  my brother
i do not know  i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden
that is she saying
you have travelled over six thousand miles and now you are gonna play hard to get
because i am the one who's single
i never even got to be single
sure you did
not if you do not count the sixth grade
okay okay  you join him  but first will you ask if he is here
oh my god  where
i meant about my idea
i think it is time we got some professional help
like a detective
no like a psychiatrist
do not be silly  how is a psychiatrist gonna find him
but how could he know  he only just met me
men have ways
sightseeing  what are you doing
a little bad luck
so you are just quitting  just like that
i know but
it was a ouija board remember
and a fortune teller
peter  peter was a mistake  an imposter
you sure you will be okay
i am sure  and kate thank you for coming  thank you for being such a good friend
i will be back before you leave
yes  is not that amazing
is damon bradley here
uh huh  okay we will be there how is he anyway
no one's perfect kate
and he is living proof
no i think maybe you have been right  i think i may have been too critical in the past
i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you would not need to change
or maybe it will turn him back into a toad
yes  he is
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep
when you could have found one in america
uh huh
i did not expect you back so soon
actually no  there's not going to be a wedding
what about larry
he is gone  he told me what happened  he just left for the airport
larry did you rent a car
no  well i do not know  well maybe  later
this is your most lucky day  my family runs a pension not three blocks from here
a porco
a pig  a pig  she is saying he is a pig
oh hello  i just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink but
i would love to
what do the years matter  i have known you for centuries
i thank you
but i do want to
you miss me
uh yeah  sure  honey did you forget the guys are coming over tonight
no why
well there's nothing here to eat
you used to love it when i called you doll
you said it differently then
what  you know him
i cannot tell her  she is called off her wedding  she will never speak to me again
he missed me
she said she knew where to find him and then she grabbed my car keys and
and you did not tell her
she did not give me a chance
she is not here
where is she
that is really romantic
ten billion to one
are not you gonna go introduce yourself
he just got a call from mr upstairs something's gone wrong he is plenty hot
i am gonna take her home first
i would get over there terry i will take the little lady home
i will come over when i am ready
you know johnny when he gets mad
talk louder i cannot hear you
if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
if i talk too loud it is the fault of the nuns
and what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it
well where are they
we was robbed last night and we cannot find no books
that is all next witness
why should he forget it
i am not thirsty
after what we been hearing about your brother i thought your throat would be kind of dry
so do i charley for your sake
what do you want me to do johnny
then do not
but my own kid bro
that was the idea
i thought they would talk to him try to get him to dummy up
maybe he gave them an argument
i figured the worst they would do is work him over a little
he probably gave 'em an argument
in a minute
it is a living
i just fnished work i counted the bags
johnny does you favors kid you got to do a little one for him once in a while
but going in that church i would be stooling for you charley you make a pigeon out of me
nolan i knew he had guts but
i have got to cover a bet there on the way over anyway it gives us a chance to talk
nothing ever stops you from talking charley
the grapevine says you picked up a subpoena
that is right 
of course the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheeseeater
boss loader
absolutely nothing you do nothing and you say nothing you understand do not you kid
yeah yeah i guess i do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than i thought charley
you do not mean you are thinking of testifying against 
i know i know
well then you know cousin johnny is not going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubberlipped
do not say that
extanker who's walking on his heels 
do not say that
what the hell
i could have been better
the point is there is not much time kid
make up your mind kid i beg you before we get to four thirtyseven river 
four thirtyseven that is not where gerry g

drew i know your dog died but get a grip man you are freaking me out

you have to bury your own that is the way the indians did it it is like a rule
you never get over it
he was dead you know he was
you think he would believe it if he did
maybe it takes a while
what do you mean
it is like he is not gus anymore he is different you know like zowie
i do not know but i am not taking any chances
i do not know  maybe it depends on what you were like before you

no it is all right  i can get a cab  night night
i quite liked it  i was not as enthusiastic as everyone else
i thought it was tremendous
i think it went on rather too long
i could not bear for it to end
and i did not like that man
oh but he was terrific
and the shape of it all  it was sort ofshapeless
really  i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good
you do not like flashbacks because your mother's a historian
good theory  but i like my mother i have no aversions to what she does
too bad  what did your father do
my real father  well he was a flashback
no there's a fourth  numbness you do everything right but you feel nothing either way
i think you are exaggerating  and if you are not you should jolly well change your job
oh yes
that must be rather nice in a way  i mean you do not have any
very thoughtful
well you know
i have to be up early 
me too
two or three years ago i would have stayed  and fucked you
too late  just my luck

you just might
i think she liked me
did she talk about me
no  we talked about history and siberian geese
i have not really thought about it

they were both poisoned i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder
if you will release me  whatever you ask for ransom  you will get it i promise you
and what is that worth the promise of a woman you are very funny highness
you admit to me you do not love your fiance
he knows i do not love him
are not capable of love is what you mean
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream
i know who you are  your cruelty reveals everything
with pride what can i do for you
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces
hardly complimentary your highness why loose your venom on me
nothing you can say will upset me
oh my sweet westley what have i done
as you wish
as you wish
of course you will
but what if something happens to you
hear this now i will come for you
but how can you be sure
this is true love you think this happens every day
move you are alive if you want i can fly
i told you i would always come for you why did not you wait for me
well  you were dead
death cannot stop true love all it can do is delay it for a while
i will never doubt again
there will never be a need
nonsense  you are only saying that because no one ever has                                                            57
you                                                            58
i myself am often surprised at life's little quirks                                                            59

what hideous sin have you committed lately
i got married i did not want to it all happened so fast
it never happened
did you say i do
well no we sort of skipped that part
i believe you  so what happens now
we face each other as god intended sportsmanlike no tricks no weapons skill against skill alone
it is not my fault being the biggest and the strongest i do not even exercise                                                            38
i just want you to feel you are doing well i hate for people to die embarrassed
and a good thing too
why do you wear a mask were you burned by acid or something like that                                                            39

that is the difference  we have got him help me here we will have to force feed him
has it been fifteen minutes
we cannot wait  the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand
how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works
we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back
over the albino i think
where did you get that
at miracle max's it fit so nice he said i could keep it
right right sorry

 wait just wait 
 well when does it get good
i do not beleeve this
well i was not nervous
because i can stop now if you want
no you could read a little bit more  if you want                                                            17
what is it that is the matter                                                            56
someday you may not mind so much

i am telling you you are messing up the story now get it right
do you want me to go on with this
see did not i tell you she would never marry that rotten humperdinck
 yes you are very smart shutup
you want me to read this or not
who gets humperdinck
i do not understand
who kills prince humperdinck at the end somebody's got to do it is it inigo who
nobody nobody kills him he lives                                                            90
okay  all right now let's see where were we oh yes in the pit of despair
no it is kissing again you do not want to hear it
i do not mind so much
as you wish
form a brute squad then i want the thieves' forest emptied before i wed
it will not be easy sire
try ruling the world sometime
the thieves' forest is emptied thirty men guard the castle gate
double it my princess must be safe
the gate has but one key and i carry that
i give you full marks for bravery do not make yourself a fool
it will not happen
death first
no  to the pain
i do not think i am quite familiar with that phrase
i will explain and i will use small words so that you will be sure to understand you warthogfaced buffoon
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me
 and then my ears i understand let's get on with it
wrong your ears you keep and i will tell you why 
who won how did it end
the loser ran off alone  the winner followed those footprints toward guilder
shall we track them both
i always think everything could be a trap  which is why i am still alive
i swear it will be done
of course
i will beat you both apart i will take you both together
let me explain    no there is too much let me sum up                                                             99
and our assets
your brains fezzik's strength my steel
true but that is hardly common knowledge is it  thank you now there may be problems once we are inside
i thought he was with you
stop saying that
 offer me everything i ask for 
 anything you want 
i want my father back you son ofabitch
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years
he is eh i will take a look bring him in
do not rush me sonny you rush a miracle man you get rotten miracles you got money
are you a rotten liar
i need him to help avenge my father murdered these twenty years
your first story was better  where is that bellows  he probably owes you money huh well i will ask him
that is a noble cause give me the sixtyfive i am on the job
okay                                                            97
that is very comforting but i am afraid you will just have to wait
i hate waiting i could give you my word as a spaniard
no good i have known too many spaniards
nothing comes to mind
again thank you
you are ready then
whether i am or not you have been more than fair                                                            30
you seem a decent fellow i hate to die
naturally you must expect me to attack with capo ferro
thank you  i have worked hard to become so
then why are you smiling
and what is that
i am not lefthanded
i ought to be after twenty years
tell me
i am not lefthanded either
no one of consequence
i must know
get used to disappointment
that would be inconceivable
you are sure nobody's following us
i do not swim                                                            15
whoever he is he is too late    see  the cliffs of insanity                                                            19
you know what a hurry we are in
well it is the only way i can be satisfied if i use my right  tch  over too quickly
oh have it your way
 there's nothing to explain you are trying to kidnap what i have rightfully stolen                                                            43
there will be no arrangement    and you are killing her
i am afraid so  i cannot compete with you physically and you are no match for my brains
you are that smart
let me put it this way have you ever heard of plato aristotle socrates
for the princess
good then pour the wine
i smell nothing
wait till i get going where was i
it has worked  you have given everything away  i know where the poison is
then make your choice
i will and i choose 
i will tell you in a minute first let's drink  me from my glass and you from yours
do not say another word valerie
he is afraid ever since prince humperdinck fired him his confidence is shattered
why would you say that name  you promised me that you would never say that name 
what humperdinck humperdinck humperdinck oooooo humperdinck
i am not listening
a life expiring and you do not have the decency to say why you will not help 
nobody's hearing nothing
humperdinck humperdinck humperdinck

tell me all about her
very early dawn
of which morning
the following morning sunday
no one met her
no of all
how do you know she did not make a call
what do you mean
you said she was sitting back there or standing rather
why should she i am sorry i have work to do mr if you do not mind
i do mind if it do not jell it ai not aspic  this ai not jelling
i do not know what you expect me to know about people come and go
she is not still here is she

suppose i wanted to search the cabins all twelve would i need a warrant
look if you will not believe me go ahead you can help me make beds if you like  come on
anyone at home
i live there alone
someone is sitting in that window
my mother
if this girl mary crane were here you would have no reason to hide her would you
of course not
if she paid you well
now look
i did not mean that as a slur on your manhood i am sorry
that is all right maybe she could have fooled me  but  she did not fool my mother
your mother met her  can i talk to your mother
no i told you she is confined
just for a moment she might have picked up a hint you would miss
sick old women are sharp come on i will not disturb
who are you friend
milt arbogast private investigator  where is she miss crane
your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars
what are you talking about  what is this
she was seen leaving town in her car seen by her very victims i might add
i do not believe it  do you
would not have been able to tail you if you did
with a little checking i could get to believe you
i do not care if you do or i want to see mary before she gets in any deeper
you can do anything you have a mind to and being a woman you will  that yours
yes it is nothing wrong with it i am just
how much
aha always got time to argue money huh
all right
in the building   mary starts for the building glancing once in the direction of the patrolman
i will be perfectly honest with you ma'am it is not that i do not trust you but
okay if you will come along
i do not need pills just sleep
caroline mary still is not in
no mr lowery but then she is always a bit late on monday mornings
buzz me the minute she comes in
her sister's going to do that  she is as worried as we are
now your sister is missing how long
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday and no trace until
how would you and this detective come to trace her to fairvale
a lot
forty thousand dollars
and the police have not been able to
with the forty thousand dollars
your detective told you a nakedfaced lie
just what he told your detective
i want to know if my sister is here
that is the matter
do not you know
to begin with where mary is do you
no i take it you do not either  how long
well what do you think we eloped or something or we are living in sin and
what do you know about it
nothing you are putting me on the defensive
i hate tears 
is mary in trouble
not that kind  you men and your egos
never mind my ego let's talk about mary
you might have doubted for say five minutes or so sister
no the man whose money she he talked so loud and fast and i i should have called the police
he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it all that cash
i ought to call the police right now
i did not see her and i did not hear from her believe that
she will need both of us
where can i stay
sam he said an hour or less
it is been three
are we just going to go on sitting here
he will be back let's sit still and hang on okay
you have an awfully nice habit sam
hundreds which one is your pet
where is the old highway
patience does not run in our family sam i am going out there
arbogast said
an hour or less
sam why call when we can go
and maybe pass arbogast on the road  thanks
sam i am going
you will never find it
why cannot i go out there with you
i do not know  one of us has to be here in case arbogast's on the way
just wait here
contemplate your panic button
maybe he got some definite lead maybe he went right on
without calling me
in a hurry
who's he
he is the deputy sheriff around here
does that mean we cannot
no i am just procrastinating  people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night  come on
i do not know where to start  except at the beginning
all right then call at least call
you are not
neither will i
of course we will
someone was at that window i saw the curtain move
i am glad we did not
bates never denied mary was here
yes  but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money
do we simply ask him where he is hidden it
why not
i could stand something regular
we could laze around here a while longer
when you are married you can do a lot of things deliberately
you sure talk like a girl who's been married
the only girlish thing you have lost
sam this is the last time
for what
i have not time to argue i am a working girl
and i am a working man we are a regular workingclass tragedy 
can you
sure it is like laughing through a broken jaw but
you could not be a criminal if you committed a major crime
i can come down next week
sam no
all right
yeah but when you do you will swing
sam let's go get married
how can you even think a thing like that
do not miss your plane
hey we can leave together cannot we
i am late and you have to put your shoes on
you have a vacancy
we have twelve vacancies twelve cabins twelve vacancies  they moved away the highway
i thought i would gotten off the main
i knew you must have no one stops here anymore unless they do
los angeles

fifteen miles i will get your bags
i will be in the office if you want anything just tap on the wall
thank you mr bates

there's no name for it but it is something that that puts a person at ease
thank you again
you are not going to go out again and drive up to that diner are you
mother  what is the phrase she is not herself today i think that is it
you should not have bothered i really do not have that much of an appetite
it is all for you i am not hungry please go ahead
you would know of course
uncommon too
i imagine so
it is more than a hobby sometimes a hobby is supposed to pass the time not fill it
is your time so empty
where are you going i do not mean to pry
i am looking for a private island
what are you running away from
why do you ask that
i was born in mine i do not mind it anymore
you should mind it
oh i do but i say i do not 
a son is a poor substitute for a lover 
why do not you go away
to a private island like you
no not like me
i am sorry i did not mean it to sound uncaring
thank you norman
i am very tired and i will have a long drive tomorrow all the way back to phoenix

no need to apologize
now what
let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking
yes he traced her to that motel out on the old highway
bates' motel  he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it go on sam
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs bates
norman took a wife
maybe you saw mary
i would know the difference between mary and an old woman
he is already been
you must remember that bad business out there about ten years ago
have you two had breakfast
i suppose you want a cabin
better sign in first has not we
have not any
i will show you the cabin
just an expression  what i meant was i would do just about anything to get away  would not you
i did not think so
i do not know what you have been saying
i have been talking about your mother about your motel how are you going to do it
do what
buy a new one in a new town where you will not have to hide your mother
shut up
forty thousand dollars
leave me alone
and then what after supper music whispers
mother she is just a stranger hungry and the weather's bad
left phoenix under her own steam
this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away
yes in the house behind the motel i pounded and called but she just ignored me
and you want to tell me you saw norman bates' mother
nothing here let's clear the path
the wound is bleeding
go to sleep
i am losing my blood
you are losing your blood
a voice 
that spoke to you
that called  commanded 
what did it say
yes the child 
but  the dogs
you did
spare me your classical answer measurements in  results taken  what if i did not miss
you did miss 
excuse me
what was her name  the one i met
day or night
i am heading out of town
where to
a place you have never been
that is the physicist's playground
it is an experiment
at the subatomic level particles obey their own logic  they connect in unimaginable ways
what universe are you in paul
a quantum one
the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium
god  i dunno  the eternal nothingness mia
inside every semiconductor you have two particles with opposite charges separated by an impassable barrier
a five hundred foot thick steel wall  but the connection between these two electrons is so 
and glow happily ever after
wait  i want to tell you something
then you get it  you will understand
she must have gone out for a walk with the children
well i got to see her
i said she is not here now you go home be a nice boy and go home
but we must respect that power we must be in awe of it
i am in awe of it mother
i do not think you are sufficiently in awe of it get the castor oil
oh mother not the castor oil
they were just bad men that is all
in what sense were they bad

she has not got any sense in some ways she is awful dumb
dumbness does not concern her doll and neither does smartness you see 
doll do not ask childish questions

a baby and she is not even married
here comes daddy
hello daddy how are you
it is yankee whisky to me
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow
yeah they are in the snow
oh i heard from her i got a letter from her she is fine but there is some sad news
what sad news did her cancer come back
oh no no she got all over that rose is fine let's sit down son
is her husband sick or something
umhmm and i suppose that incensed you
yes i guess he did he threw her away and it was the mistake of his life
that is what she would say herself
a wonderful woman boy
dead rose is dead you mean she died
it is true son the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead she is no more
nobody lives forever boy who would want to
that is a hell of a thing to say why rose
then may i speak quite frankly with you mr hillyer
please do
i have of course observed the girl in treating her
of course
i think we both know her
yes we know her
yes it is so nice i thought i would work outside
how goes it darling
slow hon but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here
what do you think of her honey
oh did you say something
i asked you what you think of rosebud now that she is been here a while
and she is such a goodhearted thing there is not an ounce of harm or malice in her
well i will admit i do not see any flies on her yet
there are no flies on rose i do not know what you are talking about
well she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in birmingham even if she did run away from them
hope for the best i do not understand all this skepticism i thought you liked rose
be nice to rose she is never had a real home
i am serious we forget he is just a child i wish you would speak to him
i will take him with me downtown  and you too rose if you want a ride
you are not having lunch
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children
well she loves children all right  she loves everybody
be kind to her she loves you so much  in a perfectly proper way of course
yes of course
what time is it
quarter of twelve
is she all right
i do not see any bruises or broken bones
no reason at all darling
well i wish you would stop criticizing and picking on her
yes darling time will tell
i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl
i am not being brutal to her
you certainly are she has an awful toothache look at her jaw it is all swollen
darling it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics 
boys you say to me boys
it is not her fault if she is popular what
that is exactly what i am afraid of  the girl has got to go darling
but what i said is the simple truth and now i see something else i see more deeply into it
i will talk to her i will reason with her
honey please
you do not like him because he is a yankee he is a brilliant doctor
he is a polecat dear
the hell we cannot
no she does not she is fine fine she is perfectly healthy do not give her ideas
but she must know unless unless rose was there more than one person
what did you forget
i am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition i wash my hands or the whole thing
honey that is no way to talk to the doctor he is merely doing his job dear
i do not understand it even in the wild days she was never as late as this
i am afraid it is my fault i made her feel guilty this morning   brother what are you doing up

sounds like singing
oh no

so you would not have any idea where he might be
have you tried walla walla  kokomo's very nice this time of year
ask her
downtown  fine  get a hold of santino i would be more than glad to talk to him
oh not uthatu downtown  utoonutown
indeed we are  we will continue the interrogation there
i ai not telling you nothing  get me santino
yes and for that you are charged with aiding and abetting  but we will let santino handle that
the pot's calling the kettle maniacal
no one person is cloverleaf  we are a vast company with diverse interests gasoline tires automobiles
it was not toontown they wanted  it was my idea of how to put the land to better use
they will not care  who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future
earl it is me valiant
eddie  jesus what happened
toon cops worked me over
boy i will say  they gave you a real toonaroo
what am i earl
not much  it is hard to talk
look doll if i wanted underwear i woulda broken into frederick's of hollywood  i was looking for marvin acme's will
that is because i do not have a doorbell
okay you have seen me  now give me a towel
toons are not given imperfections
no  i guess we are not counting lying stealing and murder
no no no i love my husband
it is the truth  why will not you believe it
that is not roger  it is one of doom's men  he killed rk maroon
do not worry you are not the first  we better get out of here
why did not you tell me
i did not know who i could trust
we are even  by the way i did find your husband
where is he
he is right here in the
marvin told me  doom was after his land  ne was afraid  that is why he brought me his will
when i opened up the blue envelope all that was inside was a blank piece of paper
a joker to the end
lemme guess where you got that from tell me something what would you ever see in that guy anyway
he made me laugh
eddie come on
that is what you woke me up for
just have not been this close to toontown for awhile
what a gasser
wait here
no one knows  he bought the election a few years back  he is been ruling toontown ever since
he was blowing his lines all right so what
so what  he is already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule
only there's no business like it no business i know
nah that goes with the territory he is a stunt bunny
get me a couple juicy pictures something i can wise the rabbit up with
i do not work in toontown
a hundred bucks  that is ridiculous
so's the job
are not you the lucky one
as soon as is humanly possible
frankly i am shocked  marvin acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years
sure valiant sure
valiant  what are you doing here
i just thought i would drop by and show you a photograph
i have already seen your photographs
yeah but i enlarged this one  thought you might be interested
have you got the will
maybe  why
meet me at my studio at nine o'clock if you have got the will maybe we can stop this thing
stop what
that was the idea
no i am not  i am a cartoon maker not a murderer
well everybody needs a hobby
no i do not
you tricked me damn you
take it easy
there's no time to take it easy  you do not realize the diabolical mind we are dealing with
baker's man but no use ruining a good pair of shoes over it
divorce  never
i needed a place to hide  i am in trouble eddie
so i hear  even talking to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting
do not worry eddie no one knows i am here
oh yeah  then how would you find my house
gee eddie i am a rabbit  we always run
you idiot  i lost the key for those cuffs
sorry eddie i forgot you are not a toon
do not ever forget that
yeah that is better
well no not uanyu time  only when it was funny
my philosophy is if you do not have a sense of humor you are better off dead
yeah well you just might get your wish
i resent that innuendo  my wife is completely innocent
your wife may be a lot of things pal but innocent is not one of them
yeah  except they screwed up  i do not think they got the will
how do you know that
an arsonist and a kidnapper  he just got outta prison
well i still do not think he would turn me in
just because you got 'em to laugh
a laugh can be a powerful thing eddie sometimes it is the only weapon we have in life
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety
i have met some cynical and miserable humans in my time  but you edward valiant are positively funereal
well right now it is gonna be your funereal
a blindfold cigarette noseplugs just kidding
i think you want a drink  how about it judge
but eddie you know what happens when
drink it jerk  all of it
if i am so smart how come i am running from the law with a toon
my brother  get inside
we cannot do anything till it is dark
what is this twenty questions
gee you shamuses are a tough audience but what happened to you that was so dark lurid embittering
yeah a toon  it was the guy who killed bambi's mother
him  oh he was vile heinous despicable a smear on the drafting board
get away from there
no it is not
that is why i will be there at 845
i tell you what maybe i better come with you
forget it
how much is a shave and a haircut roger
two bits
i rest my case
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage
good idea
i guess i am at that  cigar
only time will tell
from this box here
always in a rush you are  all these years i have known you you could never wait for anything
this is important
do you really think so
you know it is
is that right
very good  now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid
and i do not believe you
i do not want you dead woman i want the the truth
so where do you go from here
who the fuck are you
the name is deirdre and i am running this show
and who are you
the deal  the deal is we leave for nice at first light
and then
how do we know that
that is why you were riding with him
best beer in the world known to man or god
best beer in the world  budweiser for me thanks
i drink what every civilized man woman and child in the world drinks guinness
now there's the deirdre i know
and that is that supposed to mean seamus reilly
it is been known to happen
not to me you know that
i thought i did
would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there
they are part of the team  one of them's the guy i told you about
from interpol
that is him
you lose them
not yet
they are good
no seamus  i heard you the first time
you were a soldier were you
i still am
is that right
that is right
you do not have to explain yourself to me deirdre
exactly  and last night i wanted to be with someone who was just like me
duty calls
just business
oh pleaseyou are on some sort of holy mission
i am a patriate
do not even think that i am buying that
bloody fucking hell
alright  it is bloody fucking freezing in here
come off it sam  if we were not friends already we would not be here now would we
good because it cost enough  there's cheaper phones by far than that one man you better fucking use it
i would stake my reputation
but would you stake your life that is the question
in this business your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same
ready when you are
there's a problem
shut up
he will kill me anway sam shoot though me and kill this fucker
really  do you have the money with you
do you have the material
you first edvard
perhaps we could both go at the same time
i think not  after you
not so fast  who's that
he is company
bad company
what do you mean
there's been a slight problem
that is that
of course
in here
i am shocked shocked to think that you would believe him
i will destroy whatever's in the case
you will die if you leave here
it is i am telling you it is
you have told me a lot of things boyo
that is a little hate between business partners
figured enough to know there's an odd man out and i am looking at him
then where is it
i sent it to myself in paris
sent it where
a post office box
it is done
much to your disappointment no doubt
it was a mistake it should not have happened
that is it
then i guess we are set
there is one other thing
that is that
do not cross me
nobody's going to do that
i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with
i do i do
hello my friend  he does not look french to me vincent
yes sam's tough alright
and you respect him
of course  do not you
i have never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through  he is a cop
not exactly
not exactly  but close enough eh  so he saved your life then
how did you know
if he had not you would have put a bullet in his head a long time ago
no boozepaings in the mind and the mind i can control  alright let's do it
do not worry we will take care of it
then if you do not mind  i am gonna pass out
you should really let a doctor look at that
i did not expect that he would
call it a reckoning of character
perhaps  but you are not healthy and if you try i will kill you
i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created
gets the job done
all in the stomach though  your man might live
not for long
long enough to shoot back
is that right
it is been known to happen
why do not you go do better then
my way is better
did he bring that with him
what a surprise
i got a surprise for you blondie
who's they
who the fuck died and appointed you food czar
i am just worried about your health larry  you could stand to shed a few pounds
and you could stand to get a little smarter ai not that right you dumb blonde fuck
who you calling dumb dickless
eat shit and die slowly
you should learn a little patience
is that right
it is consider a virtue in some corners of the world
not in mine
what makes you think we are here to meet you
who else would you be
i know cops  and you are no cop
let's just say he knows who i am
coordinate what
things  this is my country you know
to see a man about a thing
i can do that
that is what i thought
as in they own it
something like that
and i suppose he is saying that we oughta give them something for using it huh
i did not know that you spoke french
i do not  but the language he is speaking is universal
i asked if we could give him anything else
not at all  similar but not the same
that is the difference
one's a lot more painful than the other
i have i do not know maybe a cigarette a week
a cigarette  as in one  one cigarette a week who smokes like that
i do
there is that
exactly  why not bring them
so is the woman
deirdre  smart yeah and seriously goddamned dangerous
i wonder if she truly left the ira
i have wondered that myself  none of this answers my question though  why bring me
i wanted to see who you were
who am i
whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless
i just wanted to see something
see what
you need to know a lot of shit vincent
know what
that there was a gun pointed at me
because that is what i would have done
gregor's cell phone
you were smoking
i hope you do not mind i took your pack it was on the table
please help yourself  smoke as many you would like
of coursewhenever you feel like it just help yourself
i have a feeling i am about to start buying my own
a lot of people died
i have seen a lot of people die before
i have not  not like that  how do you get used to it
you do not  you just learn to live with it
but you cannot
i did not save your life back there risked it maybe  but i did not save shit
you see it your way i will see it mine you need a doctor
you know one around here  somebody you trust
noi thought i would take you to the hospital
no hospitals  i will fix this myself if i have to
fix it yourself  why are we even doing this  there's no need to run christ  you are a cop
not exactly
you are with interpol  you are a cop
we  there is no we in my world now vincent just me
i am going with you
this does not involve you do not you understand  i cannot even guarantee you any money out of all this
it is not about money for me not anymore
you do not have to do this
yes i do
you see the bullet
i know of him
the address of the russian production company  just in case we need to find them
thorough man
if tony says this is it then it is it
do what
continue when it would be so much easier to give it up
it is my job
then quit  you do not work for interpol sam
sure i do  you heard him you heard the guy  that is what he said what edvard said
dark ops
dark operations  wet work  kidnaping assassination
very ugly
it is at that
not very zen of you huh  not so much the modern samurai after all
i never made that claim
i know  jeanpierre did
you were behind the door
i would have tried not to  but yes if it would have kept him from shooting you i would have
how could you have done that
because i owe you  look at that
you think
you said it yourself gregor's not dead if they had the package they would have killed him
i do not know
you do not know  bullshit you had her there was no way out
right now
gimme a goddamn cigarette
business keeps you on the road
something like that
no you do not and you know it
if our positions were reversed would you leave me
in a minute
i think not
yeah  we need out fucking heads examined
just like that
would you stop with that
why not
do you have a good answer
no i do not
i will work on it
finish the job
and now
finish it
what of it
you better get some sleep alright
tell me something first  the package what was it
gone  destroyed
i guess that is for the best
just to keep me company sam  i hate smoking alone  how about you  i thought all you ira types smoked
i am sure
cause the russian production company would be easier to find
it is the irish tape we want
gonna be tough
seamus reilly
why did not you kill him
how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us
you should have kill him when you had the chance  but no
you put everything on the line because you
you slept with the fucker
i am alright  and you
doing well  this is
a friend  i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes
why do not we step into my office
i might know where you could get a copy
all depends on whether you want the russian or the gaelic language version
the russian would be easier
i gotta try and overcharge him he has to moan about the price we settle somewhere in the middle
it is a matter of respect  why do not you wait outside this will not take long
hey dwayne why do not you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin
looks like some kind of drug deal or something they are not from around here   one of them's still alive
none of them had any 
i cannot get enough of it
do not lie to me
sure thing and 
i knew you would come through jesse observes the transaction booth and earl start to leave
the horniest dog in nevada
well i hope so  that pretty much cleaned me out
i would have asked my sister but its better to leave family out always leads to trouble
i hear you
he would have won more but he blew it at the end  did not know what cash and carry was
cash and what
cash and carry you know fdr world war two
never heard of it
oh you would have done great
i probably would have  i guess the clues damn near before everyone
they are out of towners arizona plates
there must be over a million dollars in here
shit more than that
what do you mean what are we going to do
i mean  earl grabs booth's arm 
why  are you kidding me
look around you partner  you said yourself you never saw anything like it
we do not know whose money it is  they might have robbed a bank who knows
hell it will not be us
we will figure something out
suppose someone knows about the money  they are bound to ask questions
who's going to question us dwayne  jesse
it is going to go bigger than that could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it
i will worry about that when it happens and if it happens and it is not gonna happen
what makes you so sure
becausei know
that is right
at the expense of six people
maybe  who cares
torch it
that is that
well i do not know  i am putting it out of my mind and you should too 
he saw everything
he will tell them everything to save his ass that is how they all work it
what are you thinking
okay then  i will do it
that is not what i mean
i do not know
this is not a joke what are we going to do
well we did not know that at the time
we assaulted a federal agent  we killed him
no we did not  he died on his own
are you nuts  they will fry us for sure  there's no way we are doing that you understand  no way
it is the right thing to do
it is the stupid thing to do that is what it is
man take it easy  you are sweating like crazy
he will tell them everything to save his ass that is how they all work it
i do not know
okay then  i will do it
exactly  this is our little secret partner
all right enough  i am tired of thinking about all this
well i am not  thinks he is got us by the balls
i have got a better idea  all we have to do is straighten out jesse
and how do you figure we do that
all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape  we will set him up somehow
he is probably made copies  he is not going to give them up to us
forget the copies  he could have made up the copies  the only thing that incriminates us is the original
he is a partner now earl like it or not
well i mean it this time  come on  let's get this over with
yeah i mean you are coming unglued jesse
if you are any friend at all you will stop talking like that
maybe we can reason with jesse give him a third in exchange for the tape
i do not knowwe have to shut him up somehow booth looks at earl 
how badly do you want that money how bad do you want to stay out of jail
not bad enough to kill him
who said anything about killing  just keep driving straight
i do not know  shit give me a break
i am just making our intentions clear go check the desk
there it isnow what about the others
you killed him
it is gonna be ok
like hell it is  this is jesse jesse
we are doing what we gotta do to protect ourselves
you do not know if he was really gonna 
come on booth grabs the bag 
do you have everything
i sure as hell hope so  let's go
it was all used  random numbers how can they trace it
i do not know  they got all kinds of hightech shit nowadays
then we are screwed
no we are not
that is right
then sally comes too
he killed herhe killed her
what happened  that is earl doing here
he found us he shot herhe killed her
booth listen to mebooth

no  it stops now  it stops here
what do you mean  look  we can make still make it work
it is not too late

uh huh
and you are solid on that
rock solid
why do not you get to the point
my point well
i am all ears
we are going to wait  all of us until everything dies down
that is the deal  if you do not like it forget it no one wins
i understand your logic booth but i do not thinktwo thousand's going to raise any eyebrows do you

by friday
what are you proposing
i want my share all of it
none of us like it
well i do not know that is going to happen next  she is pressing this another interrogation another problem
just take it in stride
no  it is not
you better believe it if you know that is good for you
do not have much choice jesse you saw to that
you are only screwing yourselves over  helllllp  helllllp  somebody
shut up jesse
okay it is under my desk  taped to the bottom side
what are you doing earl

because someone may have gotten away
maybe  that is where it was during denning's last report

booth  do not  it is nothing it is not worth it  remember what happened the last time
and i would take it out on him
well i cannot let you down now can i
he started digging through my closet something he never does
let's hope so sally if he asks me again i am gonna tell him i returned it all
dammit i am so sick of this
i know
every night i think about you sleeping with him him slobbering all over you
he does not slobber he just snores and i told you we have notdone anything in over a year

so what happened
i told you  nothing 
at the top of the empire state building 
i am not at the top of the empire state building  i am here
i think that is what i am saying
yes  some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony

okay  good  goodbye
no  that is the weirdest part about it

it is not for me  it is for my dad  i think he needs a new wife
he does not have one now that is the problem
where is your mom

i have been pretty sad but i think my dad is worse
and you are worried about him
it is very hard for him to talk about this stuff  it is like it makes him sadder
you want me to talk to him
i do not know 
i am sure he will not be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him
okay but if i get yelled at i am never gonna listen to this show again
fair enough
what kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio

your only hope
i do not get it
you have to go to her jonah you have to find her

but how am i going to get there
i do not know  do i
there's somebody on the phone for you  his name is sam
i do not think i have to now
it is a spice rack
we desperately need a spice rack  desperately
it is never happening again right

that is tomorrow  do not you have any snacks  machines
my what
your cell  your room
our lives are simple  we have little need for material possessions
right sure thing  but what about like appliances  like a little color portable  boom box
useless distractions
it is like the stone age  the room time forgot  what about a phone
and whom would you call
oh i do not know satan
your cell is more than adequate

i believe this can be settled by a simple vote
a vote
the majority has spoken
you have a phone call

but  why
i must go where i can be of use
i am sorry mary clarence  i seem to have misplaced my tambourine  good day mary clarence
saving you  move
i am a christian
you have evidenced great maturity mary robert  we shall have a serious discussion
what about me reverend mother  i think you were right  i am just a bad influence  sister show biz

really  and maybe shorter habits and women priests and sleeping late
do not push it
at least he is not a cop  at least he can afford a decent gift
i used to buyyoustuff  on your birthday   when we were seeing each other

so i do not shop
a what when are you qonna wake up

you could not believe it  vince the prince
screw you
thenyou run
you would lose  you would die  all over the sidewalk  and into the street
all right  i get the picture  i will do it  i will testify

what are you gonna do put me in a bag and bury me
i am gonna put you in the last place on earth that vince would ever look for you
safest place in the world  you think vince would look for you here
it is a convent  all you have to do is shut up behave yourself and get along
with nuns  with rulers  no way  i am gonna go back work things out with vince
but vince has contacts all over the place  this is san francisco  they will be looking for me
not again  you cannot keep calling somebody's going to catch on to where you are
keeping our witnesses alive  we hide them but there's a leak in the department and they end up dead

do not call again  it is not safe  i will be in touch
you blew it  big time  she does not want you back
does she know people are trying to kill me out there
go in and talk to her  it cannot hurt  go
what if i was vince  you would be dead right now  what are you doing giving interviews on tv
it was not my fault  they just showed up  it is helping the convent
you are supposed to be hiding out
i really cannot talk about it now  the place is packed  sro  i have got a show to do
listen to yourself  this is not a career opportunity
i am
yeah  you look great  i mean it
really  lieutenant
i have been worried about you
no  worried about you  personally
you are not seeing anybody
no  most of the time i am thinking about you  and now you have really changed
i have
you re sort of radiant   your eyes are shining  you are rea1ly different
just remember  you are a target  do not you think vince has a tv
i know i know  i will be careful  i will try
you are gonna be singing for st peter if you do not get your ass out of here
i think they would understand
that is not the point  they need me
even nuns have to pee
yeah like what
hail mary
jerusalem is a real drag  everybody hates me
a hiding place
they open a window
where is who
you will not even tell us
i would not even tell the pope
you found him  but we are not open yet
who are you guys
we are the guys from vegas  you had christy last night but you let her get away  it is upsetting
we did not tell you what
that she is a nun  that chick you are looking for  she is a nun
i am telling you
take care of it
it is a bluff vince
not totally
that is the problem
you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot
which one
which one
willy  hit the lights
she is a broad  got it  just some broad
yeah right  when i see it
forget her  we got the one we need step on it
no smartass remarks or nothing
neither did you
i figured if you were gonna then i would not have to
that is what i figured too
for like twelve zillion eternities
and then we can ice her  no nun no evil eye
she is praying
is it worth it  a lot of witnesses here
dress rehearsal at four performance at 830  sharp
we are losing it
that should have tipped us
we cannot leave it up to the feds
reverend mother on behalf of the sisters i would like to welcome mary clarence to st katherine's
oh she is doing just fine reverend mother 
but  why would anyone kidnap a nun
all right  it is a beginning  las vegas nevada
however we can also pray for other things
which convent was that sister
really mary clarence  were you a choirmistress
that was exciting
he is decent
he is kind
it is better than ice cream
it is better than springtime
it is brought people back to the church
mary clarence  you should not have where did you get this
it is no use  she just is not here
we will pray  and she will be there
yes  two men  and they had guns
she was not a nun
she is our inspiration
and what a lovely name  las vegas
but how do we get there
a benedictine
her whereabouts are unknown and we must proceed without her  pull yourselves together
she said they were from her old convent
but she was a showgirl  she did not have an old convent
but where
we can save this young womangs life and imprison a parasite  all in one gesture
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation
we are a small convent bishop  surely there are more appropriate shelters
st katherine's is a benedictine order you have taken a vow of hospitality  to all in need
i lied
i know 
she did  bring her back  now  for a talk
it is that call you were expecting vince
can you hold  can you try
are you nuts  she is not a nun  it is christy  she is a babe
okay so the problem is still the nun outfit right
this is not a time for frivolity katrina is it  am i mistaken
many have
then name one person who has seen him with their own eyes
must have been the redman  a lenape indian lives in the western woods
these woods of yours sound a bit crowded what with all the witches ghouls and indians living there
well enough  your gathering does honor to the deceased
how did you hear this
excuse me miss  they have a laugh at your expense
well unless your name is baltus you should not worry over mine
you are the blacksmith  ever shod a horse with a hoof this large
never  a shoe that size i would have remembered
two days   for murder
i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing
you must have missed your mark
i hit him square
i say is there any one person suspect in these acts
i was afraid of this
to place it inside its coffin
what is that
what are you spying on
the lenape  he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time
a diseased monster
 brom bones
he is dead  you would be also if your wound had not somehow shut
bring young masbath here
you need to sleep
bring him
you need rest
you will stay at her side
would you stay doctor  i may need assistance
what of it
all i know is three are slain their heads found severed from their bodies
the heads were not found severed the heads were not found at all
i cannot proceed without examining the previous victims
protest to my superiors if you like
your superiors are two days away
then you should have left two days ago because i have men willing to help me today
does that look like an animal hanging
oh  far as i can tell a rumor does not travel alone for long here
are you a deist  is that it  a free thinker who does not believe in divinity
it is only important what you are an adulterer
i am the lord's voice in this town
wallowing in sin and lust
they need guidance
wallowing quite literally in blood
damn you sir  god damn you to hell
he may  but not soon enough for you and not on your behalf
you cannot do this  i am a man of god
pardon me
i have everything last testaments birth certificates death certificates deeds
yes sir but do you have these
hmm  see them
may we look at them now
of course  you want them it shall not take long  wait here
a fine idea
master hardenbrook
well that might be helpful
he drowned  anyone could see
there are surgical ways of telling how he died by the water in his lungs
i could determine if he were dead ubeforeu he went into the hudson
must we again hear these heretical rantings
without disrespect look around you  we overflow  as do our courts
and uwithu disrespect constable if jails and courts overflow it is testimony to success not failure
but how many innocents rot here and how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets
even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused often quite literally
for one who calls himself a federalist your mouth reeks of republican liberalism
not liberalism  equanimity
these methods of yours there has been no practical application
not for lack of trying
excellent  then you are excused till morning
no sir no  if you ask me i say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass
van ripper and his wife agreed to take him  they have children and a good home and good land
is that all you say  look at her
it is not something people speak of openly  she did not remarry
the militia
why would he flee this direction with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover
he would not have gone into the western woods  no sane man would
no you listen  you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards
at times i do
whatever  you still need a second to tend to your things
i manage fine alone
i am sure i do not know
we must discover it  the reason the murderer chose these persons
how could he
the western woods
look again
what kind of nuts
not for eating i assure you  watch here
yes i suppose it is  keep it
no i could not
i have others  all i need is this
now hold the bowl steady  back to business
father said witches live there
witches do not exist  however
no crickets or cicadas calling  no bird songs
what happened
how could something named the tree of the dead fail to draw attention
should we go back
true enough
then who murdered the old crone  and why
good questions deserving answers of which we are in short supply
stay back
we should go
why this tree
man or woman
all i saw was their lantern
business best hidden is hidden best at night
and it now belongs to you according to baltus  i heard him say it
but if the farm is not mine who stole it away
no one yet far as i can tell  it has gone intestate
in test what
intestate  your farm all the farms they belong to no one
what does it mean
did your father take a loan
yes  i rode with him on payment days
there are none for magistrate philipse either  paasch james pieter thomas pos william
lady van tassel
what was she doing
something i really wish i had not seen never mind it  did you find the victims' loan agreements
no  they are all missing
it is nothing  she comes to read books so her father will not find her  it is absolutely nothing
what books
fiction plays and novels  baltus does not approve  now come  it may not be long before lady van tassel returns
but sir what books  where are they
i need time for thinking  without you hanging on my coattails for a change
nothing  to hell with this place and all the people here
you do not know all that has happened  you cannot understand
take me with you  there's nothing left for me here
lady van tassel
i know  hold on
take the reins
i doubt that is the end
i i am looking for baltus van tassel
you are horribly oldfashioned are not you
feel free to form your own opinion  though it appears you already have
other people
small talk
it might have been more  might have been positively grand talk
perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat
my suitor
the massive fellow brom  for someone you call friend he misplaces a good portion of jealousy
he has proposed to me twice
which may explain his temperament to have asked twice means the answer was no at least once
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic but not all magic is black
there is no such thing as magic
you are funny
may i ask why do you cover your book that way
i have had them since childhood  i cannot remember what from
it would be interesting to find out
you made this and the drawings
if you want  but
then i also have a gift for you true magic which even you will not be able to deny
i insist that you have it
very well  but it will only sit gathering dust
that would be a pity  those words might show you something you have never seen before
if these are the random stalkings of a monster what good am i
people have put their trust in you
they have done nothing of the sort
will not they still have that justice  or was it a vain promise
no stone may be left unturned  it may appear harsh
i have misjudged you i think  i did not imagine you were so cruel
it was not butchery
what is it then  scientific method how can any of this matter in the slightest
i have no solution for its meaning yet but i could not just ignore it
but why  tell me why
what troubles you
no actually you were not  every word you spoke had truth in it
what has happened
no but why do you ask that
what happened to your mother  is she still alive
she died  her lungs were diseased two years ago  what is this about
i i do not know  i no longer know what i think or what i feel
katrina  why do you follow
i apologize if i worried you
a woman should not be out alone in these woods
just keep where you are
he he tries to take the heads they will not pass
the skull is gone
yes  i did notice that thank you
i am drawing bad blood from the wound
come with me
he did not do these things  if you knew him you would realize
what did he say katrina
i have not been able to face him yet
what would you have me believe
if you think i am behind this say it
the name van tassel is blackened  you share that name
call me a liar then and a murderess say it out and out
i do not know  away
he moves too fast
his horse
no  get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump
i i cannot do this
we have no choice
yes actually
use caution
do you know i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here
no  she has gone out
look closer  do you have anything to clean it with
it is fine  now i must
let her go
yes yes  i think i will
i can show exactly
to the best of your recollection where did the open wound fall
i did not see none
what did you say
turn around  now
yes  here
you are from the hollow
in a way yes
the horseman  yes
close your mouth  keep silent
doctor he is awake
am i  or are you and young masbath dead along with me
father saw you die
this whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon  but i am not going to kill you  not me
may i see my mother
you do not want to be here  go home to your father
she did not do it please listen
she is guilty
no sir please she is innocent
she has confessed

a photographer 
it is my project what you would call my life's work
you will never get it if you do not slow down my friend
what do you mean
i mean you are going too fast you are hardly even looking at the pictures
but they are all the same

you do not give up do you
dammit auggie do not ask so many questions just get in the car

he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn
and his parents
his mother's dead and he has not seen his father in twelve years
i should not have let him go
which brings me back to my original question what was he doing here in the first place
do you want something to drink a beer a glass of water
no thank you
has anything happened lately anything unusual or unexpected
i figured he had a right to know
i do not know i have not decided yet
why do not you pick some other spot it gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning

no harm done everything's okay now  i have got to be going
no wait you cannot just walk off  you saved my life
i just happened to be there  the right place at the right time
i owe you something
it is okay mister no big deal
you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance
that is all right if i think of something i will send my butler over to tell you
come on at least let me buy you a cup of coffee
rashid rashid cole 
you must eat lunch pretty early it is only eleven o'clock
i mean breakfast

just one bottle i believe in moderation
cocktail hour is over the young man would like to order a hamburger
you do not have to tell me if you do not want to but i might be able to help
you do not know me from a hole in the wall
and where do momsie and popsie live
east seventyfourth street
in manhattan
of course where else
then what are you doing in park slope it is a little far from home is not it
that is where the what comes in
the what
uhhuh one of those cozy bed and breakfast places probably
yeah that is right
except that there's no bed is there and no breakfast either
i am not people i am just me and i do whatever i goddamn want to do got it
thanks but i will manage
suit yourself but if you change your mind here's the address 
this is the first house i have been in without a tv
my father did believe it or not that little baby is me
yeah i can believe it
it is strange though is not it looking at yourself before you knew who you were
is your father an artist
no he was a schoolteacher but he liked to dabble
he is dead
is that what you do draw pictures
yeah sometimes  i like to dabble too
i am sorry they just they just slipped out of my hands
a little less clumsiness around here would be nice do not you think
three nights
and how long did i tell you you could stay
two or three nights
it sounds like our time is up does not it
you do not have to apologize  the coast is probably clear now anyway
are you going to be all right
absolutely the world is my oyster  whatever that means 
do you need some money some extra clothes
not a penny not a stitch i am cool man 
take good care of yourself okay
i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation
appreciation for what
i do not know for helping me out
where did you get that thing
business appointment i am seeing my broker at three o'clock
cut it out will you just cut it out and come back here
i do not have much time 
i do not huh and what makes you such an authority on what i want or do not want
you are joking right i mean that is your way of trying to be funny right
if they put this creeper in jail then you would be safe
the man has friends and they are not likely to forgive me if i testify against him
let's not get too idealistic
one sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open
i do not know two or three it was pretty late
you work too hard you know that
if you do not sleep you do not dream if you do not dream you do not have nightmares
come on just a little hint
yeah right the inspiration it is a true story anyway so i do not suppose it can hurt can it
no way
i just did
i mean earlier we could have planned something
pick two or three now that the coffers are open you might as well take advantage of me
excuse me for asking but you are not married are you
is it yours
yeah it might be
here catch
not exactly i mean there was more to it than i told you
christ you did not just see what happened they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up
yeah i picked it up
and started to run
and started to run
good thinking
that is just it i did not think i just did it
so you robbed the robbers and now the robbers are after you
that is it in a nutshell
a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you
that money is my whole future
it was more complicated than that there was a reason
i suppose so he never told me about it
no wonder he was angry
do not worry about it you have got friends now remember just behave yourself and everything will work out
good i am glad that is settled
wow they sure did a job on you
research i worked the scene right into my story  that makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible
it is all right i really do know them
i was going to tell him  but in my own time in my own time 
now ask him who his mother was
hot coffee or iced coffee
do you have real iced coffee or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes
everything is real in here honey  as real as the color of my hair
if you are lucky  then again it depends on what you call living 
medium rare please
lettuce and tomato
yes please
you want another one of these too
keep it tonight  we will catch fish i will see ya back on the docks
what are you selling 'em for why do not we start there
hid it from my mom  caught a mess a sea runs  damn thing's still in my closet
carl heine's type
no but as i say the type is rare ten percent of caucasian males
and the blood could unotu have belonged to defendant  seeing that his type is o negative
that is obvious
no bits of bone no particles of scalp no strands of hair
i am a hemotologist sir i was asked only t
you do not
or from the cut on his hand which is more probable
so the defendant knew the deceased your son even then
they fished t'gether  went to school carl junior treated him like a white person  like any friend
carl held it uforu 'em  called it a lease  they make payments every june and december
why  if they could never take title
in the war  europe i believe they could hardly send him to the pacific could they
just showed up at my door big as life and twice as mean  wanted to talk to my son
that he would keep an eye on miyamoto watch out for him
did he see some udangeru from defen
tried to  defaulted on their payments
second question  what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre
a thousand
it is
you done your math right
unwritten rule of the sea  we do not bother each other stick to ourselves ask anybody
all right what if the defendant uheardu  so carl uletu him aboard to help  and uthenu the fishing gaff
well what if
well it does seem mighty warm in here  specially for mr hooks
you wereoverjoyed yourself to hear the news
happy for him  and relieved
so then youand your husband must have called friends relatives to tell them the amazing news  yes
your husband returned at what seven o'clock
closer to eight
so five hours  plenty of time for a call  he was 'excited' you say in the sense of being 'overjoyed'
of course not  we are just not quick to run and boast  in case something went wrong
and then something did  carl heine was found dead  with his head crushed
up in the air  was uthatu your reaction
why not
but if truth was on your side whatever were you worried about
we were afraid  silence seemed better  to come forward seemed like a mistake
well it seems to me
you are implying th
i said  no further questions
your friends would  your dad would kill me with a machete
we are japanese not mexican ishmael he will slice you up with a ceremonial sword
why  we are only talking
well i do not do it for just anybody
i lie to my parents every day and every night
it will be over soon  i can get you money
i am sorry about your arm  kabuo and i  are very sor
the japs did it
there's no one here and i have ugotu to talk to you
i did  but the jury will not s
it is not for the  they only get to convict him
agnostics do not believe or disbelieve ma  we just do not pretend we know
seattle boys think he is guilty  they say the evidence is rock solid
but he found you
and you were generally experienced in training men for handtohand combat
it was my specialty sir i trained several thousand over the years
what else  i had the boy teach me kendo  includingthe importance of the bow
nossir  i would gone to tell the wid to tell mrs heine
these are fishermen alvin  they do not talk at all to each other and less to me  specially gossip
and the next one
pretty darn clear
he said 'could it be somebody hit him'  and i said 'you want to play sherlock holmes here'
japanese stickfighting  they are trained as kids y'know  to kill with sticks
my gosh alvin was i supposed to object every time you did that
all right  what did your son usayu to that effect
tht was summation your h
objection  speculation
my expertise  is that i am a journalist
but is not the utruthu that there are useveralu other ways to explain ueachu of these twelve pieces
oh yes
like you could not believe
that is how journalists  answer questions
uwereu you sir  can you uproveu one word of all your fancy story
no sir i cannot  not beyond a reasonable doubt
oh yeh  he said someday he would get his land back
oh yeh  but this is nine year ago i had my healt i was not wanting to sell
actually she said you had decided decided unotu not come forward
well 'initially' is an interesting word sir  you would ubeenu arrested you uhadu a lawyer and you ustillu claimed ignorance
should have told 'everything' meaning you should have told the utruthu
i have told the truth
you mean this morning  the new story the battery story that one is the truth  that is a question sir
since september  last guys got transferred
shorthard the radio transmis sions write 'em up file 'em in a cabinet  nobody ever looks just take up space
me and smoltz came on dogwatch september 16
no night of the 16th morning the 17th  we replaced two guys named miller and milholland
some seamangs loast report stuffed in a cabinet good as lost forever  no one knows
three kids  that is she going to do
will not take two
it is public record  if the public cares enough to read it
have a look  at nothing
you are right  i better use two
do not prove there was two lanterns coulda been the one in the cabin
no you do not
you are wondering why i held it
yes he was
because the second lantern the one on the mast  was never found  so we have to ask
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there  so he climbs up  to cut it down
just as the freighter comes through is not that quite a coincidence
then where is the lantern  and where is the knife
the knife  what knife
the freighter started through at 142  the sea water seeped into carl's watch and stopped it at 147
he hit his head  on the way in
you ever been strangled by a single hand
naw i have seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes
it is a rare thing  takes a turning point
we have a warrant  to search your boat
i was checking the cables
naw i had that around for a while
sure you did  help me with this hold cover willya
sure  blood gets all uoveru your hand sheriff ask any fisherman
look no way i am letting you out there  in a half hour you could be in canada
your daddy played  i asked down at the japanese community center you smoke cigars
you mean do i like to take the offensive  or hang back and wait
i think you like learning
sure  i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open right above your left ear
you are wonderinghow come i never ask  if you did it
mr gudmundsson we uknowu what that jury is looking at
i should show them an american
i want you  to tell the truth
right  in the middle  of the floor
yessir there would been real heavy fog
does it now
a little  yes  you have to wonder
you have to wonder
it was dead  we had it tested maybe the d6 was the spare and he had to use it
two d6's  that is the kind his well was fitted for
no spare
now you have testified that the deceased was a heavy man and hard to bring out of the net
you do not  uthinku so
he was heavy but we were real careful  but i do not remember him hitting anything anywhere
you do not  urememberu
she is alright nels thanks for asking
and her farmhouse
the damage was considerable but she is insured  thanks again
which you inferred was replaced by the d6 which must have been a spare
what else could it be
as i testified  it occurs when water mucus and air are mixed by respiration  i believe i said that
meaning that he was not murdered first say on the deck of the boat and then thrown overboard
is it possible
sure anything's poss
is it fair to say that you do not know for ucertainu which it was
i already said that b
uandu that you cannot say for ucertainu whether the head injury was sustained before or uafteru death
but you are ucertainu that he died by drowning
for the third time yes
uyesu i am sure
i would not say encouraged
well he did not say 'no' did he did not say no hope existed
not in those words
so the defendant was encouraged to hope  or could have been
of course not  but it was emotional  a friend's plea set against his mother's attitude
he had no reason to
carl ever say uheu got one
i cannot speak for him
you can speak for what he usaidu just like you did for mr hooks
carl said he did not like kabuo much anymore
that is all he said
you do not live around here do you
i do not know he is in a prison camp
here you put your hand under the water and i will pump for you

very professional of you
hello second mate barnes i was instructed to come to the bridge
i was there  officer taylor accessed my cpu directly to open the airlock doors  they are not functioning properly
oh he did did he
i did nothing to the monitors
they are awaiting further information
the device has stopped responding
and i intend to correct that at once i will tell you something mac
ai not it the truth must be good to be rich
it is a little late for you to be up
look answer my question
well shut it off at once
well it is a good thing that i did
there must be some mistake you sure you hit the right commands
yes i am sure i hit the right commands
why do not you reset and run it again  the pods check out ok
trust me  even checked 'em with my own eyes
all right i will give it a shot
ai not it the truth the two say nothing for a beat 
i do not know  everything's up in the air at this point no pun intended
why did not they say
well that hotel begins construction in january there's going to be a lot of shuttle work
you want to go back to shuttle work
it is steady good benefits
that is very pragmatic of you barnes
thank you
nah i already ate  why do not you just go down there
well maybe i will  you sure you do not want anything
no  i am all set  thanks
well maybe i will surprise you
i can hardly wait
yeah yeah yeah give me a minute here
that is very professional sounding of you taylor
what are you talking about can you transmit the code 3 
you better start making sense
ok i will  the bad news is the ship is history  life support will last another 36 hours maybe
then we have got to get to the lifepods
we have the codes here  how do you want to receive them
well preferably in tens and twenties
taylor you surprise me
break it down to me that is going on
seems like they are cooperating hopefully i will be out of here and on my way very soon
i do not know  i really have not made up my mind yet  we will see how nicely they behave
104 good buddy
i know i know
cool your jetsi am doing a little damage control
damage control  what kind of damage that is going on barnes
the others decided to get cute with me so i am teaching them a lesson
well blaze your ass out of there you have completely altered your trajectory are we linking up or not
i told you i had to teach a few people a lesson
goddamn it barnes this really steams my onions
let's get something straight chappy
that is clear
good  now you will hear from me when i have the new coordinates in the meantime do not bug me
sheesh  aye aye cap'n
over and out
yeah i guess money do not buy class
no  but it buys a lot of other things
like that piece of ass he was with
i do not have a problem with it besides you get to meet a lot of interesting people
do not say that  it ai not over till it is over
will you shut up already
just do not move around too much
that is right
ryan taylor first mate  welcome aboard  first time in space
yes  theoretical discoveries aside there's nothing like the real thing how about you
this is my second commercial flight  i used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast
i am sure you will be all right
actually i have logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute mostly related to starship construction
i do not know
well maybe there's a way out of here
probably come through the wall i suppose
well maybe we can do something like that
seen one like it before
sure it complies with all standard construction codes
why cannot we
i do not know the condition of the compartments  depending on damage debriscould be a fatal mistake
suppose you did not have to hold your breath
you are right
close every door behind you
yeah let's hope he can find a way through
even if we do it might be too late
look i know what i am doing i have experience and training in space walking
simulated space walking
i understand
ready as i will ever be
so we did
at this point i am ready for anything
do not worry about me  where are we going
yeah but you did not answer my question
words to live by
it was no time to lose my partner we are going to have to hurry he is on to us
the room is filled with poison gas  the hydraulic system must have blown
a schematic of the ship  looking for a lifeline to the pods
we do not have enough suits to get the others out
a flare  a flare will not do it
why  where are you going
what  what are you talking about
i am going to try and buy you some time  i can get to the bridge from here
but how are you going to escape
do not worry about me  there's still a chance i can issue a distress signal
but you cannot be sure  it is suicide  you have to come with us
i cannot
you too
taylor  where are you
i am about to blow the wall
hurry  you have to get them out of there
how does the distress signal look
so that is going to happen to you
i am staying with the ship  i will be all right  now hurry
thanks for everything taylor will i see you again
hopefully sooner than later
sooner than later
over and out
we have room  let's go
what do you mean  what happened
we do not have time  i will explain later hurry
and so far
it did  it is  there's nothing we can do about that
except write our wills
marry you
that is right  will you marry me
it would matter to us
good  in that case i pronounce us man and wife
try not to think about it
i do not know  wave to them
congratulations on yourrecent award
thank you
is there anything i can help you with
no just enjoying the view
well there's no better to way to see the world than with us
so i have been told
that is one of my priorities
there's no time to explain  get everyone together  we found a way to the pods
where is taylor
he is up on the bridge  he is going to be ok  now who's missing
are you nuts  it is too risky
homesick  it is only been two days
we should have gone to nassau at least we could go swimming lie on the beach
besides i cannot wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity that should shore up that prick hank drexler
send it back if you do not want it
how am i supposed to know
you are delbert miles  you have more clout than some whacked out pilot  talk to him
talk to himjesus
baby take it easy
well what would you know about it you do not have anything to lose
i will tell you what you are gonna do  you are gonna stay put like taylor said
what are you going to do about it
what makes you so sure
the engines
mac  that is shaking
certainly  if you need anything please feel free to ask me  just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 
yes i know all that  mac i need you to help us out with a little technical problem
certainly  i have a full working knowledge of the ships operations
right i understand that
that will not be necessary  you can simply speak to me  i understand most languages fluently
yeah but the ship's mainframe does not i need you to tell it something
alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer
i know but we are in a bind
one moment please  one moment please
yes  you can enjoy some wonderful views from there
i would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector
that is affirmative
calm down dr levine
let me out captain  open the door
please dr levine
open it captain
dr levine please  return to your seat
they are like pink snow sir  sticky
fletcher i want you back here
it is burning
get out of there
i cannot see
fletcher  now
i cannot
of what we are able to measure roughly twentysix hundred feet
basic english  there's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet
back away then
wait a minute 
i said back away
would you wait a minute
what is it
any of you get ahead of me  walk this far up
how about i just press the button
how long will that be
two and a half days
yeah  i heard you
but she is 
nobody move
you are a fucking biochemist are not you  cannot you tell us something
shut up beth  i do not want to hear it
what was that
what if it attacks
fifty yards and closing
what do we use for defense
we are a habitat  not a castle  the only defense we have is high voltage
high voltage
it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface  but we have never used it underwater before
forty yards
but you have tested it
sure  each time it started fires inside the habitat
thirty yards
what are you saying  we cannot stop that is out there
why cannot i    what the hell is going on here
he is right beneath us
that is our reserve air
it is either that or we grow gills
do you see it
do it norman it is the only choice we have  this thing is gonna crush us
norman do not do it
pull it damn it
do not thank me dr johnson  you were not my choice  the pentagon made me take you
the pentagon  i did not know i had friends in washington
what team
the usual  plane crash  survivers unknown  routine stuff really
anything else
nothing else
press  no i have not
from what  that is with all the security
well we do not have all the facts yet
storm  what storm
a cyclone's on it is way in  i thought they would have told you on the phone
they did not tell me anything
a thousand feet
then why am i here
something like that  that does not surprise you
 wait a second 
 dating the crash at least that old
hold on 
maybe older 
it is impossible
i am afraid it is dr johnson because it is sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor
it does not make any sense
the one you recommended  in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration
ulf report  nobody's mentioned that in years  you mean someone actually read it
that is wrong with oxygen
take a look
i do not know  but it is something alien
or maybe it cannot ubeu killed
you mean that is in that thing is immortal
i do not know  that is the point
everything can be killed
i am telling you harry's lost it he is saying there's a deathwish out for each of us
just worry about yourself
what do you mean he is missing
he is missing  he is gone  he left
he is here somewhere  find him  the sub's on it is way  go  c'mon
i told you people nobody goes anywhere unless i say
but sir 
how drastic
you do not want to know
i think i do
she put a razor to her wrists a day later
when was this
'81 i think  she tried again five years ago  i thought you should know
so you knew this when you wrote your report
wait a second 
 and then brought her down here 
 i did not know it would come to this 
that is smart  let's talk about guns and violence
you do not think weapons are important
i think we should be careful consider his emotional response
damn it edmunds
 it raises a very serious question uwhat happens if jerryu ugets madu
edmunds  can you copy
if something should happen to us the navy will at least have partial records of what happened
at least our obituaries will be accurate  that is reassuring
yes i do  whatever's out there i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier
bullshit  that is out there is not alien  it is an animal
maybe so  but i think we need to ask jerry about it
no  i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat  he might be listening now
jerry  please  stop this
ted go into the control room listen for my instructions
you see the lever on the green box upper right hand corner
pull it
working on it now sir
thank you i can see that  try something else
we do not have anything else to try sir
well shit  find something do something make something up 
nothing  i do not know  everything was normal  no changes at all
harry  can you copy
send them damn it  i know but i am not gonna be held responsible 
they are coming
nothing sir
fuck him  what  hello
what the hell is going on here
well where the fuck is he
in the ship sir
they have left keep watching
sir  sir the door  it is opening
if the subs are not here yet sir 
in a minute sir
to the craft  none  not a scratch
right  so you are saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch
chipped  the door  how can it be chipped
i do not know how it can be chipped but it is chipped
i thought you said there was not any damage done in the crash
i did
then how can it be chipped
yes harry
we know how this craft got here where it is been
so do we  and it seems to have picked up something on it is travels
a break for what
ted seems to have some ideas
it is nonsense  there's enough difference between our own species to prove that
it could  but the odds of it being any use to us are against it
you do not know that
ladies and gentlemen
who is that  where is that coming from
please watch your closest monitor
we are all very proud of you harry but what the hell is it
i have to tell you  it is strange
how do you mean strange
it is not ignorant
he understands me fine
she is not gonna know sir
i am in charge
what  you want me to retype it
she is not gonna know
she wired this system
if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough  the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic
the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we have seen
duly noted ted  edmunds try using suction
what if we go out there you know  wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open
what are you going to do  shoot her
what is it
radiation shield you think
a foot and a half thick  that would withstand a helluva lot of radiation
what do you make of this
considered what  that it is american how would you think it is american
what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back
maybe we did not want to come back
maybe it is a message of some sort you know  see this red here
what  no i know they are civilians
ted shut up  are you packed  ready to go  i want everyone packed  now
sir about leaving 
we are on the bottom of the fucking ocean  he cannot just walk outside
to what
internal power
get out of there  i do not want anyone going anywhere outside understood
that is inside the sphere
captain i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions 
give him a chance  he is speaking our language not the other way around
the sensors are picking up something outside
too big
what was edmunds doing outside
resetting the sub
what sub
i love secrets
that ulf report everybody's patting me on the back about
i have read it twice norman  it is brilliant
it is bullshit  the report's a joke
that is quite a secret
c'mon beth  that report's like the blind leading the blind
because when we get down there 
wait  down where
to the spacecraft  to investigate
well let's pray that is the only mistake you made  have you said anything to barnes about this
the timing has never seemed quite right
just keep your mouth shut alright this could mean everything to our careers you know that  do not jeopardize this
what  are you threatening me
yeah  drowning
no  go ahead  really  ladies first
such a gentlemen when you are scared shitless
good theory ted
disrupt our brain waves interfere with our ability to think
the library
we have a library
a bad one  it was the only book in there  norman come here look at this
no thank you  i hate jellyfish
yeah it was awful
what about you  what happened to you
they have six tentacles  a new species  and the squid too  they had no stomach
wait a minute
yeah why
and you did not tell anyone
they are or they are not  which is it
what  wait  do not why are you 
she was crushed  feel her skin  it is like sandpaper
what could have done this
c'mon beth  do not make this personal  he told me himself they were taking us back
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute  nobody
you are jumping to conclusions beth do not get worked up 
fuck you norman  it is right here
in edmunds' things
you went through edmunds' things
he is not just a navy captain  he works for the fucking pentagon
calm down beth  alright
do not tell me to calm down
it is done alright  it is over  and there's not a damn thing we can do about it now okay
do not do this
you bastard
beth i did not  hold it together alright
i have to reset the sub
do not bother me norman
it is not worth the risk
you me and harry  he is asleep
wake him then  let's go  get outta 
get the helium out of our bloodstream  we go to the surface now we would pop like a soda bottle
why should i go
you should know how it works  just in case
in case you die too
i do not trust harry to do it
i would  but my suit 
i fixed your suit
you do not trust me
but i do not know how 
i cannot see anything  how does it look  still clear
still clear
you fixed this suit  beth
yes norman  i did  you are just nervous
my air is not i am coming back
you cannot  counter's at 10 minutes you do not have time
still clear
what are you doing in the ship  beth
getting food  we were out of food that is wrong  you sound mad
yeah well i get that way when i am facing death and someone deserts me
deserts you  harry said he would take over for me
he what
i think so beth  yes
fixing it
fixing it  but i fixed   where would you get all that
the refridgerator
the refridgerator
it is a pretty common place to look for food when you do not think you have any
that was not in there before
we must have had it delivered then
wait a second 
1800deepsea delivery  i hear they are good
none of this was here before
did you look  it was on the top shelf
you do not believe me
all i know is i opened that refridgerator 
damn it norman  i swear  i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit
you think it is me  you think i am saying there was a conversation when there was not
i do not know beth  i was not there
when did the messages start  the animals outside start showing up after harry came out of the sphere
you think in the sphere 
he acquired some sort of power  a power to manifest things
but how
i do not know
how can the sphere do that
it is his fear  the squid  he is manifesting his fears  making them real
but why is he doing it
he must not realize he is  like the navy crewman  harry was sleeping then  he must have manifested his dream
his dream  you cannot control your dreams  and you cannot control your fears can you
must be  and if it is  it is a part of him not even he can control
why would harry go back to using a code
something for burns
ephedrine hydrochloride
does it cause drowsiness  that is all we need  to get him unconscious  put him under
nothing about drowsiness
damn it  chloramphenicol
that is that
causes sleep
it is like a sleeping pill
 used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride 
three to six hours
i will just boost the doses
what  wait  is not that dangerous
how fast does it take effect
does not say
you want to kill him
look it is either him or us norman another attack and we go down with this place
thirty years ago  in residency  i passed out  you
only lab rats  here
for what
not believing you
where are you
in the sub  resetting the timer why
what do you mean different
the grooves around the door  they have shifted  and the pattern  the fluids  they look darker now
how is harry
your watch
oh yes my watch  i almost forgot
i am feeling better
are you
you think i would really drink that
you do not think i put something in it do you
you put explosives around the habitat i cannot imagine what you would put in a drink
i did do that did not i
snakes  what do you mean exactly
you know what i mean
you tell me
do you fear them
do not you
are you manifesting them
if i was then i would have had to have gone in the sphere would not i
did you
that is the phrase  keeping up with the joneses
why did you go in the sphere beth
same reason i put explosives around the habitat  for defense  for the power  to protect myself
against what  harry's unconscious he is not a threat
no he is not
he cannot manifest
no he cannot
then why beth  why go in  why put out explosives  why manifest the snakes
you think i manifested the snakes
someone did
yes someone did  but it was not me norman  it was you  you manifested the snakes
c'mon  what
you are lying 
one lonely terrifying sea snake
you manifested that beth
am i  or am i making so much sense that you are going insane
i never went in that sphere
is it
beth the message said harry  my name is harry  my name is not harry
but i have to norman
i promise 
promise what norman  tell me
it is either this or i kill you
get away from the door beth
i am not fucking with you norman you have fucked yourself
do not you know
stop what  do not blame me  it is not me
from you norman  from your mind you are doing it
it is you norman  your fear of drowning  you have to face it
i know  you are too strong beth
oh please do not shrink me norman not now
beth  gimme the gun
oh sure  here  anything else beth can get you  some more chicken perhaps  let beth check the fridge
let's get out of here beth  let's go home
hear what
get away from me
yes  and i think we already know it will
how is that
well think  because there's footprints here that are not mine
well they are not mine
it does not make any sense
i am a woman  i do not theorize  i only deal with facts
by the bunks
who says it is a he
all that banging and pounding  i do not know  we should think about making a good first impression
for who  the fish
for whoever's in that thing
you would have to ask them
it is an american spacecraft
a light switch  a button opened that door  the craft runs on some sort of power
i never said that
yes you did  norman i would not leave you out there  you know that
we never even had a conversation norman
harry  that is bullshit  we stood right there 
that is a hell of a mistake to make beth
i am sorry  slip of the tongue
yeah i do not know how you could make that confusion
in time for what
another attack
like what  i am not 
you are staring at me
no i am not  i am not star
yes you are
we can refuse to talk
will not make any difference  the tapes document everything
minutes ago  harry's trying to decode it in his room now
where is it coming from
no idea  we have no surface support it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater
is it coming from our own computer
fine  i am fine
do not be defensive
i am not being defensive
you sound defensive
i am fine
no why do not 
look would you 
whatever i can do to help
to what
time travel  a black hole
which one  let me get the list out
our present
i am completely serious  there is something very important missing from that spacecraft  you know what that is
not a clue
a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible
i do not follow you
meaning we are never gonna get to the surface alive to tell anyone
gimme another explanation
am i
look  we are under a lot of pressure we are tired you are not thinking straight
you mean you think i am cracking
no  i did not say that
then what norman
what noise
it is like
what are you still doing here
you remember opening the door
you were all supposed to leave  you were not supposed to stay down here
tell me about the door  do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere harry
you do not understand about the sphere
then explain it to me
what happens on page 87  have you ever read page 87
page 87 of what harry
i could never read that far  i never wanted to
that far in what harry
what are they
there's some sort of pattern here it will take a minute
have you looked outside  jellyfish everywhere  i hate jellyfish  harry what happened in the cafeteria
do not do this  do not psychoanalyze me  i hate squid  period  just like you hate jellyfish
you said something to me before  about how we were all going to die
did i
you do not remember that
i cannot breathe  am i clear
you are clear  you see the airlock
what happened to her
what do you mean  she is not here
when i woke up nobody was here
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me
her suit is gone
beth left
i thought she was with you
you did not say that about the food
i was just in the cafeteria there's plenty of food in there  take a look for yourself
but why would she  
she is lying norman  just like she lied about fixing your suit
how do we decode it
do not have to  watch  it will do it for you
the three of us
that is right
is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag
you know what it is harry
stop what  what are you  
i do not think so
i could hit her a little harder more toward the cranium
shut up and open the door
two and a half minutes  once we are in the sub
how far away's the sub
hold on
i am trying  shit  here  catch her
hurry norman  four minutes
i heard  i heard
shut up and catch
i am trying to keep balance with 
gimme a second 
just pull her  down like inside  harry work with me here
her legs are in the way
you got her
i am trying  there
no idea
well press something
nine hundred feet to surface
it is not fast enough norman there's a helluva lot of explosive down there
we all kill ourselves  bad joke  sorry beth
you mean forget
it would erase all our knowledge of it  all of our power
to who  arthur  nothing  nothing that norman does not already know
what does norman already know
norman thinks we should not be going down  thinks it is a mistake
what is it harry
just one of normangs many secrets
you are not afraid of the water are you norman
gimme some room here will you  back off  gimme some space
shutup ted  you did not notice shit keep hammering
is it some sort of joke  like one of those hoaxes
is it
think about it
gimme a minute here i think i have got it
do you
if it is an alien spacecraft 
save your breath  it is not an alien spacecraft
please  it must have flown here 
it did not fly here  it uarrivedu here
arrived  from where
not where  when  400 years ago  from our future
look closely  that is not writing those are grooves
salt's good for you ted  helps you from getting impotent
impotent  i am not impotent
it is not a discharge  right edmunds  you said before right  so it is gotta be a message
yeah i will work on it too
we are friends
thank you
does this mean what i think it means
it is over sir the storm has cleared
the ships
they are topside  we are ready to take you home sir
the others sir
beth and harry
they are in the sub sir  waiting
what was that sir
just that  careful it is heavy
no they did not say 
this way sir
captain who
barnes  he is very eager to meet you been calling us every half hour to see if you are arrived
what report
you mean they have not told you yet
told me what
oh so you are that dr johnson
you have heard of me
well everybody's been talking about that report you wrote
what report
you mean you do not know
know what
who's everyone
physicists mathematicians geologists you name it
geologists  at a plane crash
strange is not it  in the middle of the ocean no less
what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash
he is a pussy
you are a 53 year old shrink what are you gonna do
earth does not have a patent on buttons ted
still make a note i recognized that
you mean a picture
take a look  i rearranged the numbers  put 'em up to the light  go ahead  squint at it
i do not see anything
squint harder
please ted
try this one
this is like nursery school
do not you see it  it is a picture of the creature
the creature
unless it is an act
when he uses a phrase like i am happy i think we should think twice about what we ask him
why's that
barnes did not know  could not get a reading
has harry spoken with jerry
not that i know of  why
i am not sure
you seen my suitcase
there's nothing on the news about a crash  did he say what airline
he did not say much at all  honey 
in the closet  i do not understand norman  why would they call you
do not be so supportive honey
well i cannot imagine five years of unemployment 
four  four years 
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume
keep watching the news  are you watching the news
how are you getting to the airport you need money for the bus
i do not know
they never used to send a navy car
i am ben kenobi  luke starkiller here is leading our expedition
you might get your stuff together we will be coming up on organa major soon
well i have brought you here  what now
we have to find he rebels what we are carrying belongs to them
who's going to pay me then
i think there are some things we should talk about
i am beginning not to like you
fear is their greatest weapon
i am not afraid of anything
not bad
we are going to get in by studying imperial procedures  i do not like it
all right then we will use your plan
 and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments
what do you want with our scanproof lockers
is that good or bad
it is not good unless i could find the crystal  then it could be very good
may the force be with you
could not we have tried to think of something else first
oh so you are a warrior then
of course  i am a bendu officer
you might say i am part of the landscape here  they call me ben kenobi
i am the son of annikin starkiller
i know that
you saw through me
you could put it that way
i assure you my intentions were not bad
it surrounds you and radiates from you  a jedi can feel it flowing from him   from here
could i learn to feel it
what do you mean
i had one but it was taken at the battle of condawn
that is where my father was killed
they use the bogan force
like bogan weather or bogan times i thought that was just a saying
five maybe  let me handle it
he is bluffing
these are doubtful times  the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the
keep away i am fine i am fine
he cannot find organa major
you mean we should go after her
i did not say that but it appears to be a logical alternative
try to feel it  use the force
i cannot do it  i will get hit
stop thinking and start feeling let yourself go
i do not get it but i guess i did block it
you look great  the uniform and everything
but there was a lot of firing earlier
just be warned that things are not always as they seem especially the starforce recruiting posters
yes sir
have you been checked out
i have got it blocked  i am all right
that is that
forget it son
alert squad five but hold them until we know what it is
should we alert the sith lords
i will make a report later
as close as we can make out it appears to be a corellian gypsy vessel it is not under power
send one squad up
send out a boarding party  full assault gear
was this trip really necessary
chewbacca it is time we showed them this is not the regulation f888 cargo trawler
that is that little  wouldroid' carrying that is so blasted important
the fourth moon of yavin  i have given the coordinates to chewbacca
i would better go see how he is doing
did it occur to you they might find us
i would like to get paid before that eventually  i do not plan to stick around for the fireworks
it is automatic
sorcery  i believe in myself i determine my destiny not some mystical energy field
what are you saying
you are good with  aremotes' but how are you against something living
i do not know i have never fought anyone
good  i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around
why did not you say so before
i think i did
let's try this way  holy maker
see threepio come in see threepio i wonder where they are  see threepio
not if this tunnel deadends
no he smells something but we have not time to worry about it now
get chewbacca  try to get around it i will draw it away
move out of the way
come back here where are you going
they must be shielded somehow  i am sure the base is there
well if it is not we will be facing that death star all by our lonesome
thanks old buddy  i will be with you in a second
no need everything's under control
with four casualties
the ah door's jammed  give us a few minutes to get it fixed
who is this  that is your operating
they will find its weakness
it is too late we already tested it on organa major  it appears your data never got through
you are safe  we have come to get you out of here just relax
there will be time for that later now let's get out of here
he will be well cared for
i will but i will have enough time to transmit my application first
thank you sir  i am see threepio human cyborg relations and this is my counterpart artoo detoo
that is how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning
can you stand  we have got to get out of here before those tuskens come back
sir i have a couple of extra circuits  perhaps they might bring something
well ask him  tell him we need five thousand
i know sir but it is the principle of the thing
send feedback into the control sensors in that detention block
i read you sir
you are back  what happened  never mind  that is going on
i am afraid we are not plugged in at the moment sir  we have had some problems
are you safe
for the moment  we are in the main hangar  artoo is trying to plug into the system now
good  we are right above you  stand by
are you there sir  we are going
threepio  shut down all garbage mashers on your level do you copy threepio shut down all garbage
what an honor

yes sir
yes sir
never pass up a good thing eh 
yes sir 
who's that with you 
looks like a bug was in his brain sir
yes sir 
i cannot my legs are gone get on the boat
we are not leaving you here sir 
give'em hell sir 
v'ger is that which programmed me
is v'ger the captain of the alien vessel
v'ger travels to the third planet to find the creator
to join with him
who is v'ger
v'ger is that which seeks the creator
you may proceede
the carbonunits are not responsible for that
you infest and control enterprise v'ger believes carbonunits interfere with the creator in the same manner
not until v'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet
kirk unit disclose the information
because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet
they have repressed the creator
the information will not be disclosed
v'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information
what is enterprise's proper evolvement
enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units
more data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage
when my examination is complete the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns
the carbon units are of no consequence v'ger will determine their purpose
that is how v'ger will survive
by the creator
to join and become one with the creator
it expects a return signal now ordering it to transmit that information to the creator
it will take me from uyouu
departure angle
very well mr chekov see to it viewer off
have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator
spock  get a fix on his position
they reach final position in twentyseven minutes  mark
mr scott on my next signal
you are what
i am replacing you as captain of the enterprise
 you personally are assuming command
my experience  five years out there dealing with unknowns like this  my familiarity with the enterprise this crew
admiral this is an almost totally new enterprise you do not know her a tenth as well as i do
none available captain there's no one in fact who's fully rated on this design
you are mister decker i am afraid you will have to double as science officer
program set for standard warp entry captain
mister decker every minute brings that object nearer earth  engineering stand by for warp drive
thank you sir i am sorry i embar rassed you
you saved the ship
i am aware of that sir
stop competing with me decker
permission to speak freely sir
yes sir i will do that
of course not i am aware of mister spock's qualifications
mister chekov log mister spock's starfleet commission reactivated list him as science officer both effective immediately
no   that could also be misinter preted as hostile mr decker  cloud composition mr spock
mr decker
that thing is twenty hours from earth we know nothing about it yet
you asked my opinion sir
it is taken control of the computer
it is running our records starfleet strength earth defenses
forcefields full remaining strength total reserve
they could have many ways of destroying things mr decker
the question is mr decker uisu there a next move
i am afraid our hand is pretty weak captain  but it is the only game in town
captain i would like to go along
that would presuppose a feeling commander compassion i sensed unou emotion only   pure logic
this served the purpose
it is a programmed umechanismu mr spock
that probe in there  in a different form now  is the same thing that ukilledu ilia
it seems we uallu imagine god in our own image
a tractor beam
   we have twentyone minutes captain    we can still save v'ger and ourselves
i would never take advantage of a sexually immature species  you can assure him that is true cannot you
unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us captain directly ahead
wormhole distortion has over loaded main power systems
no more than i expected  not as difficult as this i am sorry
that you left or that you did not say 'goodbye'
if i would seen you again would you have been able to say it
welcome aboard lieutenant
our exec and science officer
my oath of celibacy is on record captain may i assume my duties
twelve seconds
mr chekov stand by on the phasers
impact in fifteen seconds
ten seconds
opinion mister spock
viewer standard ahead
maneuvering thrusters sir

that was the order mr sulu clear the bridge
why are not the enterprise transporters in operation mister scott
we are hoping it is only a temporary problem admiral
see that it is  take me over please
mr scott there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet
starfleet boost your matter gain we need more signal
sit down please
i want him here  sit down
that inquiry invades my personal life captain
and whatever you sensed out here
 is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not
i know this has been painful spock for me too thank you
intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center energy of a type entirely un known to me
mr decker i will not provoke an attack if that order is not clear to you
communicated with us uhowu
any reply from them
our 'insignificance'
but they understood our messages they broke off the attack
mr decker 
instruments fluctuating captain patterns unrecognizable
transmit image of the alien to starfleet advise we are attempting further communication
get someone up here to take the navigator's station  engineering full emergency power
delay that order scotty disengage all main drive systems
 they may have followed it utoou precisely
ilia's memory her feelings of loyalty friendship obedience might all be there
i am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information
i am seeking answers captain
answers to what spock our dilemma  or your upersonalu one
and these 'sensorswarms' collect that data carry it here
new crystals they must contain the most recent data obtained 
exact patterns the energy bolt that hit them was not simply a weapon  it dematerialized them stored them but why
captain i do not believe there uisu a crew  or that this is a vessel as such
a life form of its own a conscious living entity
no meaning no hope  and jim no answers jim it is looking for uanswersu uitselfu
what answers
'is this all i am is there not more'
high mag mr sulu
no captain not for us for v'ger
there is no alternative
the point 
the point is captain utwentytwou    
 and then to reassemble itself ucombinedu with the creator the most certain way of obtaining all the creator's answers
yes captain it needed our mortality the fear of it our struggle against it our fears our dreams
 and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us
i prefer your poet dante's phrase  'the divine restlessness of the human spirit'
based i am told on your recommendation admiral thank you
why are not you on board
captain decker requested i complete final science briefing here before
here at starfleet the enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock
which will require twenty more hours at minimum admiral
i intend to be there following that meeting report to me one hour
engineer we need warp speed now
we are ready sir
thank you scotty stand by
dock signals clear captain
helm ready sir

you cannot be an 'us' just when you want to  you cannot play that card when it is convenient
we are still their parents for the next hundred years
no  you think this is going to help the kids then you do it  you are on your own
remember when mommy and daddy got divorced

let me put it this way  hell no
by way of saying you were unhappy
no she threw you out  what a difficult woman

that is not us
because you have changed so much

something came up  c'mon ben i have got a shoot at three
tucker has not penned bengs present yet  it will not be too much longer
you will not get away with this vicious attack on our peaceloving people
all right mister ambassador  but you must treat general buck schmuck with the respect due him
certainly  how about some breakfast
possibly some coffee
do not be ridiculous
i have your word mister president
yes of course
at his office in the capitol
if he is not there try  87  43  56
did you get that kulnick
it is buried somewhere in the grudd mountains
the source wasshall we say completely reliable
the report is entirely untrue  i can assure you of that
how dare you talk to me in this manner
that is nonsense and you know it
i know nothing of the sort
goodbye mister ambassador
we have many splendidly deep mines in our country
oh yes that is right
mister president are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this
i caught you redhanded mister ambassador
give that back to me
what do you think of this mister president  i told you we should not let him in here
you mean you will tell us his name
it is not a he general  it was an article in the times about a year and a half ago
that is right fella
one two  three four  five  why you dirty stinking
come income in peace on earth peace on earthyes
why are you saying that phrase over and over again
i think that just might be it  although it could be rikitikitavi
what are you talking about major
it might still be worth trying rikitiki tavi  rttthere's only three combinations of  ttr or trt
who the hell do you think you are sir
look i did not shoot him
we will have to leave that up to the cid boys will not we major
look colonel  i have got to talk to somebody at air command
do not worry major  your rights will be fully protected
colonel do not you know that is going on
sure i do  there was some kind of mutiny on the base and you killed general ripper
look general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd bomb wing to attack with hbombs
you must think i am an awful sap major  just sit down fella and keep your hands on the desk
did not they tell you
they told me major  and i did not hear anything about any atomic attack
wait a minute  the president  that is it the president
what about the president
he wanted to talk to general ripper did not he
so what
well i am general ripper's executive officer he will want to talk to me
what is your name young lady
ceida pietraszkiewicz
what did you say
ceida pietraszkiewiczpie traszkiew icz
now look here miss pietraszkiewicz this is air command headquarters calling
yes  who the hell is this
what did you say sir
no sir
then why bother me with this nonsense get in touch with the base commander
well that is the funny part of it too sir  it does not show a damned thing
what kind of trouble
yes sir  he issued attack orders to 
you are not sure
i am afraid i will have to ask you to take the film out
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies
well sir they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base
that is a very wise deduction general
thank you sir  but what shall i tell them to do if they are denied entrance
welli suppose penetrate the base by force
you see you knew the answer all the time general
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt mister president
what do you suppose is going to happen if general ripper's planes start bombing their targets
that certainly would be a problem sir
yes sir
this is general ripper speaking
yes sir
do you recognize my voice
certainly general  why do you ask sir
i do not know sir we just spoke a few minutes ago
youddo not think i would ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important do you major
no sir
yes sir
all right major  i am putting the base on condition red
condition red
that is right  i want this flashed to all section immediately
yes sir  that is up general ripper
yes major  this looks like it is going to be it
butwhat kind of a shooting war  have they hit any of our cities yet
that is right sir
no calls from inside out  no calls from outside in are even answered  no calls
i understand sir  nothing comes or goes without your personal sayso
no calls at all  with or without my sayso my voice can be imitated too major
yes sir  i just thought of something sir  how do i know i am talking to you now
who do you think you are talking to
to you sir  but how do i know
are you trying to be insubordinate
no sir
i hope not  now as soon as you do what i told you have planr radioed to the wing
no sir  planr to be radioed to the wing
no sir  i am just bringing the facts to your attention sir
you are a good officer major and you are perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention
thank you sir
that is right major
i did not mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either major
yes sir  general can i ask a question
certainly major mandrake  you are a good officer and you can ask me a question any time you want to
well general ripper sir  i was thinking  we are on a condition red are not we
that is correct major
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress does not it
you know the regulations well major
well i was thinking maybe an enemy attack is not in progress
and if that were true
because i thought it proper major  why else would you think i would do it
but  whythat would be an awful thing to do sir
perhaps major  perhaps  pour me a scotch and soda please  and help yourself to whatever you like
you are damned right they are
how much soda sir
just a squirt
perfect  thank you major  and now let's drink a toast
to peace on earth
ask away major
well general  i was wondering why are you doing this  i mean why do you want to start the war
i have given it alot of thought major  do not think i have not
no sir  i mean i did not think you had not given it a lot of thought
do you remember what clemenceau once said about war
i do not think so sir
he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals
i see
that is close enough major
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people sir
you are being dense major  i certainly do not
our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy would not they
i guess so
major mandrake i guess you do not follow that is going on too closely do you
where sir
where  everywhere major  everywhere
not yet major  not yet
and i guess they will not until they agree to let us inspect inside their country
you are very naive major  do not they say they want disarmament
yes sir  but so do we
but we mean it because we are a peace loving country  are they a peaceloving country major
well for the same reasons we do sir do not you see
major you are talking like one of them
well i am not sir  honestly sir
do not be offended major  our president holds the same views
do not you think he knows something about this general ripper
if they gave us what we think we need yes i guess we would
and you would like to see that
no sir  i am sure we would not
do you think they would cheat
yes sir  why do not you stop the fighting sir
peace on earth
i presume the planes are armed
yes sir  the base commander general ripper selected planr
what the hell is planr
we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twentyfive min utes
how could you let this happen general schmuck
i want to talk to general ripper
but we cannot communicate with the base
admiral buldike
knock it off will you general  crudley find out that is holding up that call
they are coming in now
how long will it take to receive them all
i am not certain mister president  the boys in concom do the pencil work
how many planes did we lose
i am not certain mister president  but i believe it was four
general faceman what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson
naturally i am sir
he says they have only shot down three planes
well if you choose to take his word over mine 
look he is there and you are here
mister president there were thirtyfour aircraft involved  thirty acknowledged the recall  that makes four shot down
hello are you still thereuhhuhi will be right back  we are still working this thing out
well just common sense sir  thirty from thirtyfour equals four or my name's not buck schmuck
have you tried the recall again
well the premier doped it out pretty well its primary is their missile base at laputa
zlat make sure the secret service boys care fully search his seven body orifices
no they would not send us in with bombs on an exercise
roughly onezerofive i will have it plotted in a minute major kong
roger onethreeeight
lothar take your checks now
thanks binky  can you see bromdingna island yet
i do not think so
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level
you know what that will do to our fuel consumption
cannot help it  that is the wind like
maybe it is an exercise
they must have clobbered some of our cities already
he is right  they must have clobbered some of our cities already
the dirty stinking rotten sons of b's they might have clobbered marge and the
fifteen  twelve o' clock
forget it quentin  it can happen to the best of us  now let's get squared away
main interference linked to electronic detector  fight interference on readi ness state
roger keep calling them  knock off autopilot ace
call them every five miles
thirtyfive still straight
maximum ecm
lieutenant toejam why do not you help him
come on quentin is not that pretty selfish putting yourself ahead of the mission
look i am shot  it hurts
they must have made a visual contact
must be mach twofive stuff  altitude fifteen thousand
they cannot touch us at this height
they are moving apart
hang on boys
hey terry i am hit
could you take her up right now king  other wise we will get kind of close to the fireball
sure i will take her up right now
check your code again  no one at base would pull a stunt like that terry
that is what i am doing and it comes out the same
yeah it sure looks like the real thing all right
ready major
primary arming switch
lieutenant toejam's going to help you in a minute  can you check your ecm
listen i think i am hit bad
where would they get you
damn you lieutenant toejam  lothar
some kind of signaling

let's seeinternational morse i think keoperecal lmistakeope gee i do not know it seems to be some kind of code
very interesting
skip it and jump damn you  this flak's so close i can smell it
shoot lothar
our targets are a missile complex and an airfield  not cities right
that is what i said
well if there's a war they must have hit us first
that is your point lothar
hellnno major  i was just trying to think the thing through
bomb doors circuit is green bomb release circuit is green bomb fusing circuit is green
check all bomb circuits green  okay lothar
when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary major
as soon as i have checked over the route about five minutes  all right
primary trigger switch
first safety
seond safety
check ten thousand air burst
master kong
all right lothat that does it  master safety on now until bomb run
master safety on
everything still checks out okay
lothar get up here fast and bring your first aid kit  i am hit kinda bad i think

what are you talking about
well we sure as hell are not going home just because the enemy tells us to
wait a minute major  ope that is the recall code  where would they get that
you tell me
they must have gotten it from the base no one else would know it
why should they call us back
how the hell do i know  maybe the war's over

where is the bar
i mean could you put me up for a couple of weeks
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch
i will take it
i will have the bellhop take care of your luggage
do not worry  she is just a fan for my literary output
that is wrong with it
it is from hunger
nothing for ladd
just a rehash of something that was not very good to begin with
i am sure you will be glad to meet mr gillis  he wrote it
schaefer  betty schaefer  and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me
i just think pictures should say a little something
goodbye mr gillis
so you take plot 27a make it glossy make it slick 
sure  bases loaded
about that luggage  where is the phone
what for to recover that knife you stuck in my back
i felt a little guilty so i got out some of your old stories
why you sweet kid
there's one calledwindow something with a window
dark windows  how did you like it
i did not
thank you
except for about six pages you have got a flashback there 
how about the rainbow room
the flashback in the courtroom when she tells about being a school teacher
i had a teacher like that once
drop that attitude  here's some thing really worth while
want me to start right now maybe there's some paper around
i am serious  i have got a few ideas
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door
are you hungry
hungry after twelve years in the burmese jungle  i am starving lady agatha  starving for a white shoulder 
phillip you are mad
you will not  i will get us a refill of this awful stuff
you will be waiting for me
with a wildly beating heart
life can be beautiful
you do not know how glad i am to see youl
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher
what teacher
dark windows  i got him all hopped up about it
you did
he thinks it could be made into something
into what a lampshade
into something for barbara stan wyck  they have a commitment with barbara stanwyck
i have got twenty pages of notes i have got a pretty good character for the man
i tell you this is half sold
as a matter of fact  i have given up writing altogether
you sure have
so long
why should you do that
i will make it short
sorry  it is your baby now
i am not good enough to write it alone  we will have to do it together
i am all tied up  i cannot
we are engaged
good for you  you have got yourself the best guy in town
nobody can be that busy
you are tough all right
you are on your own  stop being chickenhearted and write that story
honest to goodness i hate you
so do i
came  on back  let me show you where it fits in
and here's a title an apple for the teacher
i mean this is good dialogue along in here  it will play
it will
sure  especially with lots of music underneath drowning it out
do not you sometimes hate yourself
who's who
i am sorry  i do not usually read private cigarette cases
oh that  it is from a friend of mine  a middleaged lady very foolish and very generous
i will say  this is solid gold
i gave her some advice on an idiotic script
should be  it cost three hundred dollars
saddest thing i ever heard
not once  that is wrong with being on the other side of the cameras it is really more fun
three cheers for betty schaefer i will now kiss that nose of yours
if you please
it must be my new shampoo
was i  i am sorry
that is wrong with you tonight what is it betty
something came up  i do not want to talk about it
why not
i just do not
what is it you have heard  come on let's have it
it is nothing  i got a telegram from artie
from artie  that is wrong
i do not want it now
why not do not you love artie
of course i love him  i always will  i am just not in love with him any more
what happened
you did
i do not know why i am so scared joe  is it something awful
come on in betty
you bet
whose house is it
want something to drink  there's always champagne on ice and plenty of caviar
why did she call me
jealous  ever see so much junk she had the ceiling brought from portugal  look at this
i did not come here to see a house what about norma desmond
nobody asked you to
hello mr demille
lots of people were  lindbergh had just landed in paris  come on in
you would better  i am very angry
i am pretty busy as you can see
that is no excuse  you read the script did not you
yes i did
then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants
what assistant
do not play innocent  somebody named gordon cole
gordon cole
you know crazy things happen in this business  i hope you have not lost your sense of humor 
i am not worried  everything will be fine  the old team together nothing can stop us
we will be working again will not we chief we will make our greatest picture
that is what i want to talk to you about
it is a good script is not it
it is got a lot of good things  of course it would be an expensive picture
but remember darling  i do not work before ten in the morning and never after 430 in the afternoon
lady  you have got the wrong man
sure  wait a minute  have not i seen you  
i know your face  you are norma desmond  you used to be in pictures  you used to be big
i am big  it is the pictures that got small
i knew there was something wrong with them
get out
i think that is what it says on my driver's license
and you have written pictures have not you
or teach it a better tune
depends on what it is  a donald duck or joan or arc
this is to be a very important picture  i have written it myself  took me years
looks like enough for six impor tant pictures
it is the story or salome  i think i will have demille direct it
and you will play salome
who else 
only asking  i did't know you were planning a comeback
they will love it every place  read it  read the scene just before she has him killed
right now  never let another writer read your stuff  he may steal it
i am not afraid  read it
of course it is
maybe it is a little long and maybe there are some repetitions but you are not a professional writer
i wrote that with my heart
sure you did  that is what makes it great  what it needs is a little more dialogue
what for  i can say anything i want with my eyes
it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil
i will not have it butchered
of course not  but it ought to be organized  just an editing job  you can find somebody
what month
december twentyfirst
sagittarius  i like sagittarians you can trust them
thank you
i want you to do this work
me  i am busy  just finished one script  i am due on another assignment
i do not care
i would not worry about money i will make it worth your while
maybe i would better take the rest of the script home and read it 
oh no  i could not let it out of my house  you will have to finish it here

okay  we will deduct it from my salary
suppose you make up your mind do you want this job or do not you
just a scene i cut out

they have come for my car
please  now i have forgotten how many spades are out
i need some money right now

i did is not it neato
uhwhat channel were you watching
what are you talking about fella
god that is what i keep you for
that is what i been thinking about how you been keeping me  i ai not getting' nothing outta this gig
gus if there's anything i hate it is greed
greed  let me tell you something
yes but they do not really need them it is just a throw back to some sentimental sea faring baloney
then how is all the people gonna get their oil
pumps stop pumping oil pipe lines stop piping oil tankers stop delivering oil man this is high stakes
i should think a taste of freedom is enough do not you or would you prefer jail

we have already got some
i invented it man in my head it is a stone killerdiller getdown getiton and twiceonsunday super mutha computer

just a second
i was afraid you would say that  hey is there a bus station around here
suit yourself gus  say does your boss use a computer in this operation
sister i am his sister
oh bubba think of the possibilities
what she call you

but how where is it getting the power from 
because you are the editorinchief your integrity is unquestioned lois i have a question
you have got to pick three more numbers
how'm i supposed to turn this thing
by hand like the pioneers did
could not we just get a computer to do this
why do i have to do this
there is no handle you just push a button
get a hold of yourself vera  nobody else ever will
oh right well then just shake hands
but if somebody reprogrammed it it could do much more
it could make weather
storms floods
blizzards heat waves
gus gorman this is my psychic nutritionist
today coffee
tomorrow the oil
we already have a supertanker
chicken feed  if gus gorman can push the right buttons 
do not cry bubba

he knows where the eiffel tower is olsen  you do do not you kent
yes but it is not all i feel
patience kalel you begin to sound like an earthling superman mother you speak only of honor of sacrifice of responsibility 
because that is your heritage those are the values we lived by on krypton
the three proved  after exhaustive efforts  incapable of rehabilitation now as you know we had no death penalty 
sensible enough
the elders have of course thought long and hard about that question
i asked the right question
 delete in cutting

thanks clark but i am booked for the night
there's no real proof that tobacco  
lois you should see what the inside of your lungs look like
not unless you can fly
come again
you were probably so scared you did not look to see what the trick was
it was not a trick
oh sure a man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it was not a trick
clark kent if you had only seen it the way i did you 
it was done with wires they must have rigged him like they do with peter pan
there were not any wires i looked
mirrors then it is done with mirrors
he grabbed me he held me he set me down gently how could that be done with mirrors
look there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce
why would he do that how would he know i was going to suddenly slip
jealous of what
of thissuperman
superman  pretty good name for him is not it
is that what they are calling him
they will once i hang it on him in tomorrow's edition

what are you doing here
he wants to see you lex luthor
the bald man the one who tried to kill me
the way you describe him does not really do him justice
i would better get you down
sure and let the plane crash in the middle of the city
okay  take me to your leader
so it is six hundred feet below park avenue it is still a park avenue address
you will be seeing stars in a minute miss teschmacher y'know
even that would be an improvement
he is from another world
tough guy huh
you are on
i did not say a word
place your bets ladies and gentlemen
fifty degrees below and still falling
when it gets to seventyfive below stabilize it
exactly miss teschmacher
stay and listen  besides it is twelve in the afternoon this is no time to go to bed
deductive reasoning my friends that is the name of the game what does it say here

this all has something to do with superman does not it
your volcano chum your junior lifesaving buddy  let's get high

if you persist you leave us no choice
neither my wife nor i will attempt to leave krypton
an ode to spring are there one or two t's in bloodletting
how come you get all the good stories lois

all of us
he sure as heck does that
we will say he is a child to my cousin in north dakota and just now orphaned  poor thing
we do not want a child called 'junior' ai not that so clark why sure it is
do not brag now  jonathan
what your mother means clark is that she do not want folks to think you are special
i bless the day you came to us son you know that but some people would not understand
 as we will be
lara please
but why earth jorel they are practically animals
they are primitive lara but they are not animals
a million years behind us  jorel he is only a baby
their atmosphere will sustain him he will look like one of them
he will be weightless
well physiologically he	will not quite fit
i want to know what my child is going to face

oh mr luthor
ah dear simple otis albert explain it to him

billy that is too early
she said she is got to be home by nine
cannot you make it later
a while
billy do you have to smoke wendell can smell if someone's been smoking
no  it should be dry by now

or that the guardrail was not strong enough
you believe that

for rabbits
from what
did he have any particular problems that you knew of  financial pressuresrunins with the law
no  i saw it on his face
and that is that
with our hands
what do you mean
you mentioned that he had a learning disability
that is right
did his parents attend to that
what do you mean
did they give him special care
that is that dolores
because i would be to blame right
yes  he does
billy said that
i did
and billy told you that he will tell that to
what other people
excuse me
who's been talking to you about what i am feeling  who should care about what i am feeling
yes  abbot understands these things
why would he be frightened
i do not know  but it was weird in terms of what happened next  sean was still watching his mother
hi dolores

was anyone waiting for the bus with you
was there anything unusual about the driver dolores driscoll or the bus that particular morning

my usual place  on the right side the first seat
and according to your recollection there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning
until the accident  no  yes there was
as i am talking i am remembering more about it
why were you scared
this is before the accident nicole do you understand what i am asking
yes i understand
why were you scared
dolores was driving too fast
the speedometer  and it was downhill there
you could see the speedometer
yes  i looked  i remember clearly now  it seemed we were going too fast down the hill  i was scared
seventytwo miles an hour
seventytwo miles an hour  you are sure of this
i told you i was positive  the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was
i was scared  and there was not time
there was not time
no  because the bus went off the road  and crashed
you remember this
yes  i do now  now that i am telling it
you mean it

i see  so you do not believe anymore that the company covered it up
there's 215 bones in the human body motherfucker that is one  now do not move
open the goddamn door
ballistic penetration shocks it but only for a few seconds
so do you
why him
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor
then what
why attack russia
because skynet knows the russian counterstrike will remove its enemies here
jesus  how much do you know about dyson
i have detailed files
i want to know everything  what he looks like where he lives  everything
son of a bitch i knew it
can you get us in there past security

no  there is another chip
i am sure it feels very real to you 
on all what
on furtwngler
i do not know
that is right i was raised very strictly so do not speak before you are spoken to
oh and do not wave your hands about
respect your elders and your betters
and no elbows on the table
eating is eating and
and talking is talking well i think we better get on
i do not know
but i promised your mother
i do not know but you and i already know that he has saved lives
for chrissakes i hate that shit cut it out
i am very sorry
i am steve that is your name
david david wills i am your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural affairs committee sir
sounds a lot of run  so they sent the big guns to check up on me we recruiting children now
i guess so sir
you call me sir again and i will make you listen to beethoven
i guess it is possible
so what does the russki want
colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you
major richards said he would call to let us know
that is big of him
it is a bet you are the witness emmi
yes what was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for hitler's birthday
why not show dr furtwngler the evidence it may refresh his memory
david what are you counsel for the defence now  did you hear the question
you bet
and totally irrelevant
with more what more what
major he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect
david i do not understand a thing about you you are a jew are you a jew
yes i am a jew but i like to think first i am a human being
colonel pleasure
so major tell me have you questioned dr furtwngler
not yet
we are dealing with degenerates here
do not talk about things you know nothing about he was in a dictatorship
yeah yeah art and politics yeah yeah i heard all about that
let furtwngler go please
i have a duty
then you are going to kill me
three months
says here because of your father that is that mean
my father was one of the officers in the plot against hitler they arrested the plotters and their families
your mother too
yes she suffered longer she was in ravensbruck
and your father was executed
but he only wrote nine major
i am kidding emmi what about a record player you have that too
no ours was damaged
that is in those files
come in emmi this is your office too emmi this is lieutenant david wills
shut the door emmi sit down emmi we are going to keep him waiting too
do you know where the adagio begins
of course
put it on ready to play and i will tell you when to play it
i cannot do this it is not right
that is not right
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that just like you questioned him
i did not conduct at at the rally i conducted on the evening before the rally
how come
could i have a glass of water please please fraulein
i do not buy that
it is the truth
i do not remember in detail there were so many
did you call someone you knew
i may have as as i said i simply do not remember
may i ask a question
your guess is as good as mine
i need to work i need to make my living i live off the generosity of friends
tough tough
it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me
why were they going to arrest you
it would be truer to say i think that a lot of people in high places knew me
i have had enough of this i am leaving
who warned you
goering because hinkel was working for goebbels
what did goering say
i wish to say something
go ahead be my guest
maintain liberty humanity and justice
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal adolf hider
i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings
think carefully wilhelm maybe not in your own name but as privy councillor or vicepresident
i do not have to think carefully this is utterly ridiculous
von der null
yes von der null
von der null
and what did he say
he said  wouldo not mind him his job is to criticise your job is to conduct'
and what happened to von der nul
i have no idea
you have really no idea i will tell you what happened he died in stalingrad
i am sorry
you like the women do not you wilhelm
no i am not going to stop it hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter
i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter
i do not understand what you mean
no that is your problem wilhelm you understand nothing we will call you go
i believe that but just answer the question do not give me explanations
speaking to party members i used their language of course i did everyone did
of course i know what that is
okay so what is it
bruckner's seventh the adagio
who's conducting
it means i was not good enough to be a first violinist
me never  never
i will ask the questions helmuth
excuse me did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience
do i know hans hinkel
that is what i asked
do i know hans hinkel
you seem to understand the question now how about answering it
hans hinkel was in the ministry of culture how could i know such a man  i
do you know that is in this archive
how could i know that is in the archive
love 'em helmuth i give up what are you holding in your hand
the one he kept in his right hand yes you remember
yes you remember
how could i forget
show you
do it helmuth
exactly  replaces the baton gives steve the case
do not worry helmuth it will be our secret
so you wanted to see me
all in the cause of humanity helmuth or should i call you one zerofourninethreethreeone
major we are discussing a man of genius i do not want
of course you too like everyone else in this goddamn country
he did
one of your people told me
one of my people
sonofagun we will find the corporal and we will find the telegram
never heard of him who is he
edwin von der null music critic he gave furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan
who's he
his private life
yes dr furtwngler was absolutely clear about this politics and art must be kept separate
i do not know what you mean major
when you got to the crescendo
right claims assessor
conscientious determined dogged
they said i was dogged
first oboe
i have your questionnaire here it says you were never a member of the nazi party
absolutely not
hey hey slow up fraulein straube has to take down what you say
then how do you explain him being made a prussian privy councillor
it was beethovengs ninth
do you really think it was brave did not he bow to him and shake his hand
you are not supposed to talk about it who told you that
we do not even know you
well we are fbi agents
you are not fbi agents
does what
why do not you go home to the old lady 
sorry do not have one
you called 911 except the call was intercepted
they took her 
i apologize for making you wait  i have brought some new evidence with me 
evidence of what
yes i know
nothing completely conclusive 
working with
agent mulder
technically and biologically though he will never recover
the developing organism is using his life energy digesting bone and tissue we have just slowed the process
no nowe need to try our vaccine on it
and if it is unsuccessful
incinerate it like the others
this mangs family will want to see the body laid to rest
tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life and that he died heroically like the other firemen
of what
is it an emergency
strughold he is just gotten on a plane in tunis
there are complications
you got some kind of business with him
i am looking for him
looking for him for what
that is that
selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer
yeah i had an appointment for a pelvic examination
no do not bother
we were not expecting to find those remains of course they went right off to washington
was there anything in those offices that did not go to dc
no just fossils far as i know
show you right on a map
standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding
yeah i did
i know the name why
old friend of your father's
heard you come here now and again figured you would be needing a little drinky tonight
you a reporter
i am a doctor but i think i mentioned that obgyn
who sent you
i came on my own after reading about the bombing in dallas
sac darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb
he just let it explode
that is the question nobody's asking why that building why not the federal building
the federal building was too well guarded
before the bomb went off
that is what i am saying
and one little boy
do you
not according to the men in blue
for what because i am a dangerous man because i know too much about the truth
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write i knew your name was familiar i just did not know why
you know my work
you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency why
you cannot
yes on the texas border some kind of experiment something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks
 you saw this experiment
what did it look like
a transportation system transgenic crops the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus
that would be my guess
your guess
yeah well i do not have them all
you have been using me 
i have been using you
you did not know my father 
i told you  he and i were old friends 
you are a liar you lied to me to gather information for you for your goddamn books did not you
where are you scully
i am on the roof
did you find something
no i have not
that is wrong scully
i know that but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street
i think they have that covered
how is that
it is locked
no you did not
oh yeah had you big time
panic have you ever seen me panic scully
i just did you are buying
something sweet
where are you mulder
i am in the vending room
nice try mulder
thirteen fifty nine thirteen fifty eight thirteen fifty seven
hang on i am gonna get you out of there
 mulder get in the car
all i told them was the truth
they are trying to divide us on this scully we cannot let them
they have divided us mulder they are splitting us up
what what are you talking about
i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment
they were the ones that put us together
i was until about an hour ago
is that before or after you got the idea to come here
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting
is that what you would like me to do
get dressed scully
mulder  what are you doing
just get dressed i will explain on the way
according to this tag
and you are looking for
there's some kind of cellular breakdown it is completely edematous
i would been told as much
you are saying the bombing was a coverup of what
i cannot really talk right now
what did you find
evidence of a massive infection
what kind of infection
i do not know
 i will have you back for it scully maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away
mulder  i cannot  i am already way past the point of common sense here 
this is where he marked on the map scully where he says those fossils were unearthed
and you have never seen anything like that
no  it did not show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests 
it looks pretty green for this climate
all the equipment is brand new
no irrigation system somebody's covering their tracks
i do not know mulder
and where are they going with it
that is the first question to answer if we are going to find them
about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction
where would they be going
we have got two choices one of them is wrong
i do not know why i think they went right
this is great this is fitting
 of what exactly
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off to hide something bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself
they haul gas in tanker trucks they haul oil in tanker trucks  they do not haul viruses in tanker trucks
yeah well they may this one
what do you mean by haul  what are you not telling me here
this virus  it 
i have no idea
very weird
any thoughts on why anybody would be growing corn in the middle of the desert
not unless those are giant jiffy pop containers out there
for the purpose of what
i hear the humming like electricity high voltage maybe
maybe maybe not
come on
i do not know
salt lake city utah transfer effective immediately
you cannot quit scully
i can mulder i debated whether or not to even tell you in person because i knew 
we are close to something here  we are on the verge 
you are on the verge mulder  please do not do this to me 
after what you saw last night  after all you have seen  you cannot just walk away 
i have i did it is done
just like that 
i am contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers 
i need you on this scully 
you do not mulder  you have never needed me i have only held you back  i have got to go
i think something stung me
i think you are in anaphylactic shock 
no  it is 
where are we
you got me but i think i know what they did with jimmy hoffa
yes you can you are going to make it scully
that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel
on whose orders
general mcaddie's
well call general mcaddie
i do not have his number
they can patch you in through the switchboard
thank you
about what
 they are asking her for a narrative they want to know why she was in the wrong building
she was with me
 if it looks bad it is bad for the fbi 
 if they want someone to blame they can blame me agent scully does not deserve this
she is in there right now saying the same thing about you
where is scully
whoever they are  this goes right back to dallas  it goes right back to the bombing 
i do not know
i am not taking any chances
i have got to find scully
what happened to kurtzweil
he is come and gone
i have answers for you
is she alive
about the conspiracy
i think of it as an agreement a word your father liked to use
i want to know where scully is
a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with it must be administered with ninety six hours
you are lying
no for god sake you have got it all backwards
what do you mean walked
that is why you bombed the building the infected firemen the boy 
i thought it only fair you should know given how hard you have worked
what happened to kurtzweil
as your father knew things need to be sacrificed to the future
where is he
dr kurtzweil is in the trunk
find agent scully save her only her science can save the future
what about you
my life is over  go
i am sorry my grandson fell and broke his leg
we have been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual reevaluations for us about our place in their colonization
well without a cure for the virus we are nothing more than digestives anyway
and mulder
you need not kill a man to destroy him
no you need only take away what is most precious to him
a pocketful of rye
fourandtwenty blackbirds
almost  mockylock showed up
mockylock is the bogeyman mockylock wants me where i am
mockylock is a pain in the ass
lucien baines
she thinks i can bring edward back
someday you can  we all believe that
why not  just once  a trial run  what harm could it do
i do not want to find out
i have heard this argument before  it is not happening
it could take years for me to get past the barriers he is created
yes but you are a willing participant picture edward in a strange place lost frightened
i would be there for him
yes mother
i have got to feed my cat  besides i want to get to bed early
that is my girl
a pocketful of fucking rye  that is wrong
disorientation nausea migraines hallucinations insomnia paranoia

what then
the soul  the spirit  whatever you want to call it
ah the part of us that cannot be explained

just like we all have fantasies right things only we know that we do not share
that is what therapists are for right
what did you see
you are the shrink you tell me
as soon as i met him you knew i would say yes  he makes julia real for me
i did yeah
you were right  there's a part of him that knows the truth  about what he did about himself

if a leopard did not do it who did
i drink
and when you drink you get drunk
i sleep it off
that is just it charlie that is what i am driving at you could do anything in that time
of course not charlie i never thought you did
and my leopard   maybe he hurt the first girl  but no more
they do not say it to me
up at the museum
but he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl
yes i was drunk mr manning
here have a cigarette he was only kidding
no he was not kidding i am sick claw women hurt little girls no
what do you want to see him for
i want him to lock me up
look charlie you did not do it and you know you did not
i do not know i want him to lock me up
you found the leopard
where where did you find it
what arroyo  how did you get to it 
all men are fools they like to make a big show  shout and hunt 
you will meet a rich man and he will give you money
go on 
let me see it 
maybe not  cards mean different things different times 
you must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave

rosita  i have wondered 
what senorita
when you are going to see pedro does your heart beat until you tremble
you think be's pretty nice do not you

you are lucky i wish he would front page for me
i know i know you have got the talent i got the breaks
hey  i am over here
i will miss you too honey 
good evening
well now that you have had your history lesson i think i will get on to the museum
i want to ask you something
you are worrying about its killing someone else
yes i want to go out and patrol the town  be everywhere at once  be sure nothing happens to anybody
of course it is the way any decent man would feel in your position
you know about animals  their habits  will it come back
no i am quite sure
do not feel so concerned jerry
but it does not eat what it kills
caged animals are unpredictable they are like frustrated human beings i cannot answer your question
we are old friends
more or less
i will take you about got some nice things
about charlie's leopard
charlie likes his leopard
but he would have to know about leopards  have access to leopard claws and hair
i do not know
do not you want to see the rest of the exhibit
some other time
just barely possible   yes
all right  the dead then  in history there must have been men like that  men with kinks in their brains 
i do not mean that how would he act what would he do
not i tell you no
you shot the leopard we know that you killed consuelo you killed clo clo then tonight 
i did not do anything she screamed something frightened her
consuelo screamed too  and clo clo why did you do it why quick tell me why
it is better you do not know
tell me
why do yo&ampi accuse me you do not know what you are doing  you do not understand  nobody understands 
that was a calamity
miss walker  i did not expect anyone 
they do but  there are no lights out there  they will just be shadows 
thanks sheriff
it is not for me  i am literally and figuratively a tenderfoot
something's wrong with this whole setup 
nothing much  just that it might not be a cat this time
let me get one thing clear did galbraith make a direct accusation
no he was kidding charlie
professional hunters who rid the state of cougars
you think galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse
i am sure of it
i am not interested in what somebody else thinks you being me facts and i will act on them
yes and i am taking it to headquarters for examination
kiki  he will not hurt you there's nothing to be afraid of
makes no difference get him out
listen kicks you will never guess what i have cooked up this tine
that is easy me
no i thought that might be just a little corny i want you to lead him in on a leash
you are too good to me
look kicks have i ever done anything to hurt you
no  not yet
and i never will you know that is between us  we are a thing but this is serious competition
get it out of here
kiki  he will not hurt you there's nothing to be afraid of
makes no difference  get him out
listen kicks you will never guess what i have cooked up this time
that is easy me
no i thought that might be just a little corny  i want you to lead him in on a leash
you are too good to me
look kicks how long have we known each other
this is l939 cannot you subtract
almost three years is not it and have i ever done anything to hurt you
no  not yet
and i never will  you know that is between us  we are a thing  but this is serious  big competition
the red dress  no my black one then i will be just like him
now look what you have done
do not be soft
and i suppose you do not feel bad
i do not know  a witness he seemed to know something about animals  you know  expert testimony
what did he have to do  look at the body
we all had to look at the body it was awful kiki  awful
you remember the fellow this morning  galbraith you have got time before the supper show
and not a sign of the leopard
do they close up every year for this processionist business
he is a nice guy vie ought to keep in touch with him
i know funerals
you mean you want to take them to the cemetery
yes do you mind
maybe i want to feel badly
that does not make sense
you us
maybe there ought to be less racket and more us
if that is being a softie  there are two of us
you are positive of that are not you
absolutely sure
did not you take your cut out of the closing check
i got into a little crap game
that is funny  i never knew you to lose that much before 
what you cannot be 
i  i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise 
eloise does not own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check kicks
all right i am not ashamed of it i split it two ways 
half to the delgado family and half to cloclo's family
how do you know
we will 
i know  teresa 
i hated you that day  you and your flip talk  with that little girl lying dead
i know what do you think i felt when you said do not be soft
that is a good idea sire
what do you mean
let someone else pretend to be you and see if
majesty i cannot
why are you not ready to die for your king
of course i am it is just that
good  until then feel free to live like a king
so pretend it is not a game
10000 gold crowns
jeanne's been badly injured  she jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat
but not impossible gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her
tremoille do not  please
louis water and fresh straw
right  raymond a priest
well uh  this might take a little time  but let me see what i can do
this i can do  i was studying at the university of paris  till the english invaded it
i thought you were an archer
yes i am  i am an archer who can read and write  who do you want to write to
the king of england  i want to give them the chance to leave orleans in peace before i get there
jeanne calm down  you cannot blame the people  they have been hearing all about you for weeks
how dare you stop me doing god's will
how dare you tell me what god tells me to do
uh they said they will think about it
they have started the battle without me
jeanne you have been badly wounded
no it is it is nothing it is
i promise
jeanne no
yes  yes i am fine  we need more brushwood  why are you staring at me like that
because there's an arrow in your leg
so what am i supposed to do now
what what do you mean
it is been weeks since they spoke to me  since the coronation no signs nothing
maybe their silence is a sign maybe it is a sign to go home
but how do you know what you hear is the truth
i do not know it  i feel it
you make it sound so simple
the truth is always simple it is you jean who's making things complicated
jeanne i believe in you more than anyone
tell me
tell the king to give me more men
you listen to your voices i listen to my heart
he said that he is making a treaty with the duke of burgundy and
it is a trap  they are buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england
did your voices tell you that  you told me you had not heard them for months
no but
or maybe it is jeanne who's in a trap  her own trap  a downward spiral that she cannot stop
did you come back to marry me or to insult me
to marry you
to be killed in battle
it would not be the same without you
not yet
but why that is the point
do as i say
i want to stay with you
that is an order
just give me a moment and then you will be free
i am already free
yes yes any moment you are always so impatient
i  i do not understand
one day you will
jeanne you cannot leave us like this
sound the retreat
but i promised jeanne we would fight on
i made no such promise  sound the retreat for the night
but that was her order
you are afraid of displeasing god when telling the truth
no  but my revelations were for the king of france not for you
good advice for the french not for the english  do you think god hates the english
i do not know but you are all men of the church why not ask him yourself
i tried to
it was on a sunday was not it
i do not remember  maybe
do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day
i do not know
that is not what is written in the evidence look for yourself
quite a few
did not you also carry a banner
i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword
and why was that  did it have some particular value or power
no it is just a sword is a weapon
are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you would have killed more people
then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger too strong perhaps
yes probably maybe
so sometimes you were carrying just your sword
yes but
did you use the sword that you held in your hand
no i i held it up to
you held up your sword and flourished it about in the air like this
yes maybe i do not remember
and when was that
well at the coronation of king charles vi
thirty years ago  i am not surprised it is gone
performing a miracle
what are you doing  this is an ecclesiastical court  you have no right to do this
rouen is in english territory  i have the right to do anything i like  take them away
we want her burned as a witch
how can i calm down when i am made the laughingstock of the whole court  i have had enough
 and your prerogative is to find her guilty
but we cannot do that unless she admits to blasphemy
scared to make a mistake  supposing she is right supposing she really has been sent by god
am i am i dead
dead you are worthless darling
where where am i
and god who allowed you to be caught
no no i am fine really
i was so worried  we have all been looking for you  the english are everywhere  o thank you lord
what about you
do not worry about me  just stay in here and do not move
but where are you going to be
i will be right here i promise
who are you
your trial jeanne  on a charge of heresy
but the king  my king  did not he pay my ransom
it seems that the english care more about you than the french
the english
yes  they paid your ransom tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at rouen
in a village called domremy
how old are you
nineteen or thereabouts
were you baptized
yes  in the church at domremy
recite the lord's prayer
not unless you hear my confession
and you be careful you who claim to be my judges for you too will be judged one day
i assure you they do  so answer me when was the last time you heard this voice
not long ago
when exactly  a day a week  when
last night
many things
did it give you advice  good advice
and may i go to mass
as often as you like  now please  for the love of god  sign
you have nothing to regret
silence her  take her away
and you  why did you lie  you promised i could be confessed
i know jeanne it was the only way to save you from the fire
it is not my body i want to save it is my soul
i  i cannot jeanne i cannot hear your confession i am sorry
he is feeling wonderful
thanks be to god
and your duke  the duke of bedford
do not look at the cost look at what it brings  what is your last offer
who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions
you really think she is been sent by god
for the sake of france charles and for the sake of my grandson
then her faith will have to be bigger
i am i am not the king
i know you are not yet  but you will be soon
 you look wonderful
 and my crown does not fit and  really
now hold on  you are not captain here on the battlefield perhaps but not in the royal bedchamber
so how would you put it
tremoille i am not even king yet who would want to assassinate me
my dear loyal tremoille i know i can count on you
 as always majesty
 to ensure our privacy  i need to talk to her  alone
if there was i did not see it
then why did your king believe in you without any proof
go and ask him yourself
does he have hair
i am more interested in what he says not what he looks like
that is enough  you will answer the question or face the consequences
that is not a lot
20000 gold crowns
i must offer to the duke  i will give you his answer tomorrow
yes they were
good  where are the english
everywhere  where is the food
good  can you bring me to him
he is on the other side of the river
for what
jeanne put yourself in my shoes for a moment  how would you feel if you were me
knowing what i know  enormous gratitude
can we  uh  discuss this later
sooner is better than later
the wind will be against us
the wind will be with us  do as i say
we are taking back the tourelles
i know what i am doing so either lend a hand or go back to bed
we need another ten minutes
the bridge will not wait
not yet
the english will not wait
and it is not the first one  they say she saved a little boy who was dying of
as long as she brings food and supplies she will be welcome
that will put fire in my soldiers
damn right
oh but i forgot  it was a sunday that explains it  god's day off
me too
yes  we can pray
good idea
no good  this is a disaster
i do not think  i leave that to god i am nothing in all this i am just the messenger
but the bridge has been pulled down
the english are rebuilding it
no not like this
for weeks you have been asking for this well now you have it
i care  and i care because god cares  all life is precious to god  even his  even yours and mine
maybe i do not know but first we have to confess
i know but so is the enemy  they are falling back  paris is ours
jeanne we are not enough
so bring up the reinforcements
reinforcements  where
jeanne look behind you
never look behind  only ahead
of course i do  bring them up
jeanne that is not ten thousand reinforcements  that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers
but where is dunois where are the men the king promised me
the clothes are not important
so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man
i submit to our lord
but will you also submit to the decision of the church
i had been sold to the english  i would rather die than fall into their hands
did your voice tell you to jump
you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge
yes but
and you did not jump of your free will
nothing just taking his teeth
but you cannot just kill a man for his teeth
why not  he has good teeth
because because you just cannot
that is different i mean we were fighting for a for a cause
hey my friend  i am glad to see your ugly damn face again
la hire i am warning you  do not swear
sorry jeanne  did you both meet already
then lord dunois show me the way to the other side of the river
they will  and so will you if you go on swearing like that
god knows but it was a bad idea
were the men confessed  where are the priests
that is the use  the drawbridge is up
not for long
won  such a small word will never do  this is victory jeanne this is glory
 the smell of victory jeanne mmmmmmm  i love it
it is not possible
jeanne get up this is ridiculous
if you kill him you kill me
i said kneel
yes a halfsteed white
who gave you that horse
my king
how many did he give you
five steeds and a few hackneys
as much as for a lord  what an honor  did your king give you other wealth apart from horses
yes i was given a few but i never had time to wear them
still pretty wealthy for a peasant girl would not you say
and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god would not you say
i  i  i
i am that i am  you do not like my face  maybe you prefer this one
no no i am just a messenger he needs me a higher calling
you think god is not big enough to deliver his own messages
i do not know please tell me i am dead
who are you to decide if you should live or die
i do not know what do you want from me
nothing  i am here to set you free
i might ask you the same question
i i am leaving i cannot take anymore
and what exactly is it that you cannot take anymore of
everything  prison  humiliation  being abandoned and betrayed by everyone  i cannot stand it anymore  i would rather die
i do not know  i do not care anymore  i just want to be at peace
i told you already i am here to set you free
what are you doing here  please leave you cannot stay here
why  are you waiting for someone else
they are going to come and visit you in here
yes that is what i pray for
i want to see that  do you mind if i stay on the side  i will not bother you
no no  you cannot stay or they will not come
why not
because i have to be alone
what do you mean they will not come
why would they
yes lots of things
you mean god said i need you jeanne
no but he sent me so many signs
what signs
but it did not just get there by itself
oh  you cannot remember  let me help your memory
oh no  how about this one
yes  we fought and killed in his name the king of heaven
i agree
why are you doing this to me  do you get pleasure from hurting me
what are you doing on the wall
i am trying to make my cross look more beautiful
what for
because because i do not know what else to do to please him
do you think this cross will protect you
no i
good  but love your enemies body and soul
i do not think so
are you going to leave me too
yes of course when you do not need me anymore
are you sent by god
do you think you are ready
are you willing to follow all his commandments
yes my lord
let's see
i need to confess
but you already confessed this morning
i need to confess again
so alright  what terrible sin have you committed since then that cannot wait till tomorrow to be forgiven
there's no sin in charity jeanne
they were not my shoes  mine were too small
whose were they
my father's
i am sure he will forgive you
he already did but i want god to forgive me too
jeanne  if we were to ask forgiveness all the time we would spend our whole life in church

he is all right
you know how it is dad  he is sort of under mother's thumb

not at all
i am very interested in that body
yes yes
he said that father's in town he is been seeing julia right along
that woman
she could tell you where father is
not a thing
was there much blood
i hope you will not talk that way to the police when they come here
children will you go into the next room i want to talk to chris alone
what are you talking about gilbert you were not there
know  but i saw him 
we were looking for this bird
that is he want of you
wanted to tell me he did not kill julia wolf
that is that to you
ask him  i do not know
i am asking you
keep on asking
so you say   go on bob
i will have to try to remember
that ai not a gun any more  the firing pings busted  the   do not waste time talking about that
man to man i am not
it is a bargain then  anything you want to know
oh that is a phoney  the men did not even have to go down
nothing yet to cinch it
fifty will get you a hundred that he did not do it
what do you mean
for one thing he was too absent minded to hold a grudge
who's your candidate
what about jorgensen
i will check on that  i am afraid this is kinder dull for you
let's go and see  taxi
i think we are on the right track
who are you calling
she is ready to talk  it will not do any harm though  to find out where he is
fifty will still get you a hundred
this is enough for me
lucky thing for us they were not in that lime
extraordinarily lucky
i never saw him  i do not think anyone saw him
he said wynant tried to steal an invention
yes  but we figured it was just blackmail
i will take care of him
because i found out for certain that he did not commit the murders
was wynant's
yesterday  i gave her a thousand dollars
seen any signs of it bill
oh then you did hear from him
he telephoned me today
he did
i was not in  my secretary took the message  he left word for me to meet him at the plaza
when was that
about three
did you go
yes  but he did not show up
i did not know they had a fight
well thanks  we will call you when we need you again
i see
you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it until we came
why yes
did you see anything in miss wolfe's hand
that is nothing  i saw him myself
let him have his say out
good morning lieutenant   sorry
i do not mind telling you i would rather have you working with us than against us
looks like he planned something he shut up his apartment and his shop
i guess all the suspects are here
they will be here  do not worry  my men are picking them up
you are a great help to a hostess i wish i always had you for my dinner parties
that is the idea of telling me you just knew the wolfe girl by sight
maybe if you quit running around after other women you would not have so much trouble with this one
that is a lie lieutenant  anybody that says that is a liar
want to take a poke at him
i did not mean you mister
where were you
marian  marian do not go i will behave  i will do anything  do not go marian
how would you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering
how can i help but mind i am constantly humiliated  just because i have not money
i will get some
you have said that for weeks
i know
why do not you go to see julia she handles his money
i could not go near that woman
i said all right
just what i said i would do
you would not do that  you would not
would not i  just watch me
chris  chris  
why you said
never mind
so i see
he is not anybody  just a fellow i used to know
i thought you would given up that sort of friend
do not worry  you will not see him again  what happened did you change your mind about going
no  i just came back for a second i wanted to get those bonds
what bonds
the government bonds  the ones you took from the office safe
oh yes  why you told me to sell them a long time ago
i would never tell you to sell those i bought them for my daughter
do not you remember
no one else had the combination of that safe  you took them  what did you do with them
go ahead
they will be pretty rough with youwith your record
hello   give me   well   
i will give it back to you   all i have got twentyfive thousand
you are going to return every cent of it
i cannot i have not got it
what did you do with the rest
i never had it
then someone was in with you  who was it  who was it  i will answer that   hello   hello 
good morning i am afraid this is not a very merry christmas for you
oh he is sitting up
that is all right
so did we  i mean sherlock here

i do wish you would tell me where you are going
i am not telling anyone
but suppose some business comes up

i resent your tone sir i have men who are missing

36 hours they have already sailed from the persian gulf
you might say i have always been one of mr valentings biggest followers
which part the colonel's or yours
sir elliot
come let's get out of the noise   i will give you a tour of the building then we will talk
i tried to save her but she remained a manic depressive fits inappropriate behavior delusions of grandeur
i wonder if it runs in the family
the only difference between a psychopath and a genius mr bond is the degree of success
i can feel your pain
yes i can see you have hung the rest of your relatives
they are merely tools to disseminate information
sidney perhaps we should leave this to 
goodbye mister bond
chernobyl will look like a campfire
what about the gold
take the girl leave the handcuffs we will drown her at sea
i know pirates from sumatra want the cargo smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships
sometimes kill the crew other times   torture them
i am sorry
next morning both boats nothing wrong  my 90 year old grandfather thinks 'ghost in the computer  silicon dragong
i appreciate your time 
maybe you should talk to sidney winch owns a marine salvage company nobody knows more about the strait
where can i find him
him he is a she   at the bar
four o'clock m will meet you in the conference room

tsi tien chienpenny
ah james you always were a cunning linguist au revoir mon cher
hello james enjoy your meeting
 we all want what we cannot have
not all of us 007

i am sorry it was a national emergency 
not a clue i did not lose the ship  next your new personal communicator  picturephone fax beeper

i do not care who you dial so long as it is not me next 
 four wheel drive
do not even think about it 007 they are my granddaughters
get them out of here if he says one word shoot him
what are you talking about we went through all this and the ship is not even down there
yes the ship is down there but the gold is gone
that is absurd it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold
i know what i saw 
is that any way to say hello
i thought your specialty was goodbye
is this another one of your games
stop it you are hurting me cannot you just be nice
i have got half the british government breathing down my neck i do not have time for your nonsense
do you
it is on the boat he is holding a press conference tomorrow

q's retirement party i would just put the knife into the cake and 
come on i know better than that 
well if you insist
how is old q
gone fishing
not from forty feet
i see
i believe q's exact words were  hopefully nothing
hey  the world is my office
let's take a look at the body
something with an engine not oars
step into my office
tide and current charts work backward from the body  find where the ship sank  where did you get the boat
not if you kill us first  unless that is how you plan to leave muffy
she married a hockey player
i envy your 'undercover' assignments
we work in the dark we do what we can
spends his nights at the kuala lumpur yacht club
can you arrange a meeting
hell the cia built that club
he tied one on
who knows fog night
they would never sail this close to the shore

everybody who have been associated with harry end up with pennies over their eyes
what must i do
if it was left up to me i would poison him
why not harry says that is the only way to do good
when did you talk to harry
do not shout
harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock
where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends they all smell of moth balls
counting the gray hairs in your head
counting the what what does that have to do with the price of butter
i was just trying to make conversation
where is skip

i am sorry he got those birds
you know the man next door is near death

laundromats for the washing of money unfortunately carl had only one successful business
do not you have some good news  is not there something positive you could say

it is the same  what happened to what they gave you
carl i am running late  i am coming right now

so my wife is lying
drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world canada is completely overwhelmed
it is so frustrating
me too

should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is
this is different
i think she has to find out for herself on her own  we have to allow her space 
the first thing we have to do is present a unified front
if you start in on the war metaphors i am going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole
look i am as worried as you are

it is a death sentence  i will never make it to the trial
we can protect you
carl and i were friends from childhood  he was loyal that is not a mistake
when the dea gets into the narcotics business then we will stay at the four seasons

i hear these stories  your husband in jail  his business in chaos various people fighting over the scraps
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization not ours
you do not  listen to this woman in a mangs world a very violent world
there are plenty of other suppliers in mexico
but not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt
i do not know  perhaps i remember something
we have the ability to change the color odor and physical property of cocaine
you want to smuggle narcotics in mr espastico jacobo  that is nothing new
not in
i do not believe you
i am six months pregnant  i will not do it

that is crazy  my husband is on trial for smuggling
exactly and this is how i know i am not getting into business with the us government
deliver that safely to tigrillo in san diego  and we have a deal
i do not know  something
they would not do it in front of all these people  they would send someone later when we are alone
anyway i do not think we will ever see them again  everything's back to normal
the police will not find your car
your new friends
yeah  it should be fun  you wanna come
not this time
oh really  general salazar was there
no but a lot of other people  you should come  you should come out with us
we keep our mouths shut
we agree
so maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations
we thought maybe you would have that kind of information for us
this is a very different proposition
i feel like a traitor
javier rodriguez
well javier rodriguez you have done a very good job but we will take care of it from here
an informant
what is the name of your informant
it was an anonymous tip
if i can
i am trying to bust the tijuana cartel
what is it you want me to do
a small thing  nothing really
only if he can be trusted
he will do what i say
everybody has a weakness
so that is it doing in tijuana
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power
it is possible
which part getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities
we kidnapped noriega out of panama is that covered in your constitution because it is not in mine
noriega is a criminal
this is a business  get the fuck outta here

charlie nicholas david niven malcolm mclaren elvis presley 
ok ok so that is the point you are trying to make

yeah no more i am finished with that shite
well it is up to you
the sick boy method
yeah well it surely worked for him
he is always been lacking in moral fibre
he knows a lot about sean connery
that is hardly a substitute
you will need one more hit
no i do not think so
to see you through the night that lies ahead
your favourite dish
why thank you
stick it on my tab
regret to inform sir that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago
in that case 
as you wish
sure will pal sure will
such as sitting in a darkened room watching videos drinking smoking dope and wanking does that answer your question
it is really nice tommy can we go home now
it is fresh air
no joy yet
how long is it
six weeks
six weeks
she read it in cosmopolitan
six weeks and no sex
i have got balls like watermelons i am telling you
yes but then she finds out i have bought a ticket for iggy pop the same night
went ballistic
big time absolutely fucking radge 'it is me or iggy pop time to decide'
so that is it going to be
well i have paid for the ticket
but where
i do not know tommy i do not know if it is normal
it is i  the journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one
it was not the barrier stood between us  but we breached it
magnificent you are the first to find me
we sought only your infinite wisdom
and how did you breach the barrier
with a starship
this starship could it carry my wisdom beyond the barrier
it could yes
then i shall make use of this starship
it will be your chariot
you doubt me
he doubts me
bring me the ship or i will destroy you
the ship
bring it closer so that i might join with it do it or watch these puny things die horribly
my pain
it runs deep share it with me
rescued at last
return to prearranged coordinates for pickup
is there a problem gentlemen
sulu look the sungs come out it is a miracle
do not worry fellas your secret's safe with me i will send the shuttlecraft to pick you up
all right we are lost  but we are making good time
and we cannot see a thing request you direct us to the coordinates
plotting our new course
new course you have no authority  that is going on here
estimating destination in 67 hours present speed
but captain we are firing directly on your position
position bird of prey
raise shields
but the shuttle
do it go to red alert
i do not have a clue
a federation starship
i instruct you to surrender you are under attack by federation forces
do you realize what you have done it was not bloodshed i wanted
enterprise this is starfleet operations come in
i apologize for canceling shore leave but look we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus iii
on the planet of galactic peace
with all due respect the enterprise is a disaster there must be other ships in the quadrant
other ships yes but no experienced commanders captain i need jim kirk
oh please
no but you can bet they will
understood kirk out
it is all i have
what do you know of my pain
let us explore it together
the power was within you
i feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart how can i repay you for this miracle
join my quest
what is it you seek
perhaps i have a way to bring one here
but how
have faith my friend there are more of us than you know
i think you gave me too much time captain
very well mr scott carry on
aye captain  how many times do i have to tell you the right tool for the right job
i hope it will not come to that mr scott
if we could send a distress signal
mr scott you are amazing
beam up spock and dr mccoy now
er you forgot to take it with you
put it on the veiwscreen would you please
put it on the screen
captain we are receiving transmission from paradise city they are demanding to know our intentions
respond with static let them think we are having difficulty which would not be far from the truth
paradise city can you boost your power we are barely receiving transmission
transporter room status
go sulu
i am flattered twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me
because it is there
ah captain
spock i appreciate your concern but if you do not stop distracting me i am liable to be one
perhaps because it is there is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain
i do not understand
i have always known i will die alone
i am preparing to toast a marsh melon
are we leaving captain
that song did not come up in my research captain
i was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words
life is not a dream
go to sleep spock
yes captain
goodnight bones
goodnight doctor
the same he is apparently fallen out of favor with the klingon high command
perhaps i have captain perhaps i have
i cannot be certain
but he does seem familiar
he reminds me of someone i knew in my youth
who is it he reminds you of
the knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by vulcan belief
damn  let's go
that puts us pretty far away from paradise city
to land any closer would risk detection
mr sulu execute
we do not have 12 hours
be one with the horse
yes captain
an eternity during which we will be vulnerable to klingon attack korrdyou tell him
let me do something
captain what have i done 
what you have done is betray every man on this ship
worse i have betrayed you i do not expect you to forgive me
forgive you i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass
if you think it would help
if i had pulled the trigger sybok would be dead
i ordered you to defend this ship
you ordered me to kill my brother
look the man may be a fellow vulcan but that does not
no no no captain you do not understand sybok also in a son of sarek
i did not
there you see see
i have a half brother

he is sorry see he is sorry everything that makes everything all right he is sorry everything's
this is a new brig captain it is escapeproof
how do you know
the designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find he failed to escape
is what possible
that he is found it sha ka ree the reason sybok left vulcan
that is a little vague spock 
a t
a nuh d end of word
c k
the only problem is it is up there we are down here
it must be all those marsh melons
if i activate them now captain we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate

james t kirk captain of the enterprise
i will take you to the bridge
you cannot expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier
i have done nothing this is who they are did not you know that

starfleet are you aware of our currant status
uhura i had the strangest dream i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise
scotty dear he' not a madman
he is not
no sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we have always been afraid to express
it was not my intention to amuse you these are serious charges however if you surrender now
of course of course then i will take the ship without your help

what do you do anyway
a little of this a little of that mostly i tell fortunes
where would you learn to do that
from my father  he was the tribe's shaman
a medicine man
those are white words not ours
nice house for a shamangs daughter you must be good
come here
like you
i like them  i was sick of looking at this room  i think they add a little life
nothing like a little liveliness
i have ideas
such as
maybe i like to find out about a man first  maybe i like to know what he is made of
still playing
that is not an answer  what is it you want
you know what i want
maybe i just want to hear you say it
if he says that is what happened jake it must be true
yeah i guess you are right
and i take it things did not much work out the way you planned
i am still here are not i  see this
i do not know how
you just walk away
from here  i do not know  far  far enough
have you ever been there before
beautiful  beautiful beaches  blue water and clear skies as far as you can see
take me with you
i cannot
he does not give it to us  we take it
yeah a bird in a gilded cage
how much money has he got
near as i can figure must be about a hundredthousand
onehundredthousand  that sonof abitch lied to me
lied  what do you mean
i    nothing  just something he said  so if the money's in a safe we would have to get the combination
we would have to kill him
i do not know what i was thinking but i cannot do it
what are you talking about
kill someone  i cannot do it
is it so bad  it would be quick he would not even have to feel it
jesus christ  listen to yourself i cannot do it grace  i cannot do it
i wanted to talk
i do not think we have anything to talk about
what about us
there is no us remember
except i cannot get you out of my head grace
i have thought about you every second since i left  i can still taste you on my lips
stop it
why  am i making you hot or does the truth scare you
because i know you are full of shit
i mean it grace  i am getting out of here and i want to take you with me
i thought you could not leave  i thought you could not get your car
i could if i had jake's money
is that what changed your mind  the money
we do not have to kill him  just knock him out and tie him up untill we get away
after dark  i will leave the back door unlocked
what was i supposed to do
you could have hit him or kneed him in the balls
i do not know
you do not know  jesus christ do not you think you should have found out before we killed him
i am not sure where it is  not exactly  i never saw it  i just heard him talk about it
there has to be
you are calling jake stupid  you
do not yell at me  i know it is here i know it
i told you  i knew it was there did not i tell you
we are going all the way  together
what about him
let him watch  i want him to know what he is missing

had push it in  funny thing it would not start
funny thing
you liar  you wanted him dead  you seduced me into killing him
damn you  what did you do that for he cannot prove anything
no you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so i could go to a hanging alone
not me  us
it does not matter  he was there and he let it happen  he cannot take us in
give him the money
he cannot prove anything john  he cannot turn us in
he can kill us  i do not know about you but my life is worth thirty thousand dollars
you killed him
he was going to take the money
thirtythousand that is all  we would have been free and clear  you did not have to kill him
it is our money  he had no right to take it
just drive
he was going to
i know  he was to take the fucking money
you are tense  what are you all uptight about
you killed a man for no reason
you could give me the gun
now what
now we dump jake split the money then you are on your own
but you said we could be together
are you kidding  i am not going down with you for killing a cop
what difference does it make  you killed jake
i think i busted my leg
can you climb back up
i am here
where the hell am i going to go
john you have to throw the keys up to me
what for
the trunk  it is locked
it is not locked  i left it open when i took out jake's body
it is    it is locked
you closed it did not you grace
i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up
bullshit grace  you were going to drive off and leave me here
no  i swear it
and you are not one to lie are you
throw me the keys and i will pull you up
why do not you come down and get them so i can wring your pretty little neck
yeah they will find you  dried up and twice dead
you idiot  you will kill us both
at least i will have company when i die  ai not that right jake
for christ's sake john  throw me the keys
what do you say jake  should we trust her  no  i did not think so
fuck you  do you hear me john fuck you  john    john
i am her husband
i swear to you that is all that happened  i have not so much as set foot in your bedroom
a lot that means
grace tell him
yeah i know  more careful
i guess we have never been introduced proper  jake mckenna
jake mckenna  that is a solid name
i am a solid man
john stewart
what brings you to sierra
my car overheated  i pulled in to have it fixed
where you headed
i have got to make a stop in vegas then i am heading to santa barbara
live there
got work  i know a man who's got a boat  wants me to sail it for him
ah i can smell it on you
mad like a dog in heat i bet you were  i can tell you got a temper on you
would i what
would you kill her
how do you know if you have never tried
this is a joke right  you just want to rattle me  right
just ran into a little trouble
another accident  you have really got to be more careful  can i get you a drink
i had a problem getting my car back
you just seem to attract trouble do not you
i was hoping we could talk
talk  about what
about things  about your wife
sweet grace  what about her
about what you said this morning
i do
you said you would cut that up with the man who did her in
i did
i am not rambling
you are talking like a mad man
you are the one who brought it up this morning  in your car
that was just loose talk  i do not want anybody dead
bullshit  you wanted me to kill her
a man does not always mean the things he says
you meant it
what makes you say that
the slimy bastard who's going to do it for you
this morning i did not know how badly i would want to get out of this fucking town
and for that you would kill grace
for that i would kill a nun on easter sunday
just to get out of here  that does not seem much for a murder
how do you put a price on murder
i put it at fiftythousand dollars minus your cut of course  which is
make it twenty
maybe    tenthousand  and that is a maybe
i need thirteen
that is a bit much
if you cannot trust the man you have hired to kill your wife   
be quiet boy  i am thinking  it cannot be done at the house  it should be   
and tell her what
is the job done
the time was not right
i guess i have what you would call a lovehate relationship with grace
you love her but you hate her
came close this time and it scares you
drop it jake
and next time next time somebody is going to get dead
shut up
thirteenthousand dollars  had you done it  is not that what we agreed on
you think that is a lot of money
all i have in the world
that is what i like about you jake you are an honest man
trouble with the car again
you could say  i do not even have it yet
darrell giving you problems
he did more work on the car  he wants fifty bucks extra for it
maybe you heard old jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you would help yourself to a little
wait a minute  just listen to me
there's another reason  it better be good
i came for grace
you came to take my wife from me
i came to kill her
that is a thick change of heart
wh    what are you talking about
then maybe this afternoon  when i sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead
christ jake please
sense  if i had any sense i would have killed you this morning and been done with it
what are you    you cannot    you cannot kill me
twohundred dollars    that is how i put a price on murder

someplace else then
which is shit
no matter he will have to know how close we came
keyser sate or not if keatongs alive he will never come up again
i'11 find him
waste of time
a rumor is not a rumor that does not die
if it was a dope deal where is the dope if it was a hit who called it in

he was a corrupt cop verbal
keaton was a piece of shit
i just want to hear your story

i'11 be sure to mention that to him
you wanted to know what happened after the lineup i am telling you

come on keaton was a cop for four years who else would know the taxi service
what lawyer

to love you must be able to feel
if you knew how i yearn for that

it is too soon to know
but i could understand i want to understand
i love him

i love michael  michael
i only wanted to see as others do feel as others do  but marguerite could not help me  nor julien

as long as you get the hacksaw piece done by friday friday
you know that circulation is down for three months in a row
i heard something like that
i am sorry  i did not think
a person could get killed round here just for working late
do not mention it  now can i get back to my accounts or do you want to fillet me
chic magazine
yes it is
tell me brian what would happen if the client lost the key
then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
so there is only one key
that is right
and it cannot be forged
no it is no problem  i do it all the time
all the time
no  not all the time  i mean
no  i have been abroad for a long time
oh really  you must remember me from when i was a regular customer
i was not a manager here then mrs steckler  do not you remember
i am terribly sorry  i have a bad memory

is white an expression of innocence do you crave innocence leslie
let me ask you why do you wear black ellen carter what are you running from

i have something i have to show you
it seemed like a good idea at the time  why did you marry your husband
why should i
why not please  it would help me
tell me about your adopted mother
did you
did stephanie kill your mother
then make it stop
demons this would not have been possible without you you have given me incentive ellen  i can see clearer now

leslie i am sorry  i  i did not know what to think
i am sorry
yes  i suppose so
no thanks  
he does not need to
what was i supposed to do
there is not that much  you did not even taste it  that is wrong  do not you like my tea
it is not that  i just do not want any sugar
why whats wrong with the sugar 
nothing leslie  i just think we should wait
wait for what
you killed my friend
it is what you would do to me
no  i will have you after
at 200
i do not know  it is your house ellen
yes  but you live here too  if it were your house
i would prefer it if you kept away from leslie
yes i can
leave who the hell do you think you are
i am your landlady
i had an accident  i fell down stairs
is leslie here
no he had to  he is just  he is out
he saved my life you know  has he told you
that is this all about
so have you seen hubby recently ellen
at home alone  where were you
as it happens i was at home alone  maybe we could solve each others problems
get out
i think you had better leave
no  a dentist
no worries
do not worry about it 
and not just any novelist  a great novelist  it was an impressive piece of work ellen
yes  of course
no  she is not in any trouble is she
oh no sir  just making some enquiriesjust tell her that inspector taylor called on you  she will understand
i will be sure to
who said anything about surgeryit will only take a moment
you and your pep talks
that vibe is from your wrist pal you have been overtenderizing your meat again
she smiles at everyone ted  she is like a newborn with gas
one thing for sure christy malone ai not lookin that good naked
that is crazy talk
i defy any and all limits
any time any day a man can completely reinvent himself
poor freud turning in his grave
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation
nobody knows about your constant masturbation
and nobody knows you are a virgin  aw who are we kidding
well dad said
maybe he got promoted
cut it out before you break something
for a guy about to try his first dom perignon you are extremely uptight
wait a second i thought we were hamburger guys
be cool fake it if you have to
this is not some 80's porno film you dip shit there are no wild sex orgies
oh well maybe not yet
not ever never
i would kiss your mother with this mouth i mean if she was not you know
yeah whatever
i better go dad
check it out
beauty no we are talking goddess
and some really fast cars
it is a lot to digest imagine how you would feel
where they get all the really good porno channels on cable
take a whiff of heaven
how would you like it if i did that to your mother's panties
i would call you a sick twisted fuck but this is different  she was not your mother mother
give me those
yeah he is probably been serving cocktails so to speak at the orgies
sorry ginger got a little you know enthusiastic
you will never believe who's in there
it better not be my aunt trudy
with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip
chicks are like buses if you miss one do not sweat it there's another coming 'round the corner
no leave one somebody's grandmother might want one
and while you are at it i will take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads
i love those springy head puppies
brilliant  molly give me all you have got  for merk
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty we wanted to showcase women throughout the world
next time make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold
except the girl the only one that really mattered
this is a fun placebut we do not usually come here until after the orgies
oh god  look look
if it is not straight by now son you probably should see a doctor
these are real live women
we do not generally feature blowup dolls in our magazine but hey if you think there's a market for it
god i love being dead
we reinvented ourselves
new hushpuppies do not make a new man
you have obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers
that explains the emptiness that haunts me
jealousy is so unattractive
he kicked major ass and you know it
from your lips to god's ears
you go first
ladies first  i insist
well the prom's coming up
shut up  are you serious of course i willof course
you like me i like you i guess it is pretty obvious to everyone
i do not like you we are just friends
but that smile
oh ted duh  i smile at everyone since i got my braces off
so you will think about it
the answer is never ted never except maybe in your dreams
yeah you like
makes your shoulders look so big and broad
christy  you want to be in heaven
i turned eighteen over spring break i am eligible
i do i mean yeah i do
i have to admit i am so totally turned on we should do it now
do it
you knowtake the pictures
which you pulled hard
that was code for i like you
i miss those days when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence
things change now i am taking off my clothesall by myself
i mean what do you think
you expect me to think at a time like this there is not a drop of blood in my brain
oh teddy bear you are funny
come on i was hamburger you were porterhouse
maybe on the outside but inside deep down i have always been dripping with special sauces  are you hungry
then you better get in the water before you get burned
we own a small family grocery store
of course dumpling its very nice of ted but
i always wanted craftsman tools he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors
oh honey we cannot accept this extravagance
we wanted you and jimmy to have it someday something real and honest
we love our lives just the way they are
do not you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family
we miss our family
it is my private business mine
dad please
grandpa was so strong back then working from the crack of dawn so proud of his peaches
remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you
you are way ahead of me again
of course we are
they did not want me when i was born why should i care
they did do one great thing they gave us our boy
i guess we could go to disneyland or something
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood
like one of those national geographic specials with the topless chicks
whatever helps you cope
i guess it is better than having tribal patterns carved in my face
there ya go always remember focus on the peach
not the pit
i know they were simple people but did this trip help your college fund at all
dad let's just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore including the bookstore
well good every little bit helps
we are grateful ted it is not that those craftsman toolsthey are a dream come true
it is okay you need me
your mom said you have been ignoring your chores
you ordered a winnebago
watch your tone mister
i will not have my boys arguing
they are in the ignition silly
i do not have much experience with auhstick
want a lesson
got it
i do not even know if i should be doing this it is a very expensive car
it is your car these are all your cars
some of them have to be automatics
your father liked shifting he said it brought him closer to the engine like a woman purring with ecstasy
i know  i am ginger miss april
the one with the horses
that is me
i almost did not recognize you withoutyou knowthat stallion betweenyouruhlegs
shopping really i should tell my friend
do not worry  he found the chocolate room
hi ho silver
what do you mean i am ted nelson
and who is ted nelson
i always knew there was more i felt it
whatever you want
of course we were
what do you want me to do
this is humiliating we are being ejected from a prom
hang in there i will think of something
but if you are watching this then it means we bit the dust
before we knew it we created the most popular mengs magazine in the entire nation the rest is history
i am helen mcdole  your father's executive secretary
they kept this scrapbook of your life it meant the world to them
your parents would be crushed to think you were not happy with it
they are not my parents helen my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much
i understand
and the girl i love she hates heaven if i keep it she will never respect me
but how can you respect yourself if you do not
well jay they have been exceptionally supportive
are they hitting you up for donations asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee
what about the future you planning to rock the boat at all stir things up in heaven
you can call me jimmy again sheryl petersen said james sounds too pretentious
sheryl petersen is what nine years old what does she know
she knew exactly where you were staying which you neglected to tell me your own brother
it is really latedo your parents know where you are
most places are jimmy
they say money cannot buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile
so what brings you here at his hour
my new bike
very funny
i came to ask permission to take custody of your room
my room
better view more spacious new carpet it is a nobrainer
it is not up to me
mom and dad said it is yours they seem to think you are coming home
you can have it then i am not going back there
you want it in writing
just a formality
are they okay
funny you should say that my grandfather was a peach farmer
i meant biologically
that is a crappy thing to say
let me guess retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof
christy's a very talented journalist i see a pulitzer in her future
i did not know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job
i have absolutely no intention
do it i tripledogdare you
but you tripledogdared me
it was for your own good in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way
it is so nice to have friends like you christy
your article sucked
in what sense
come on julie do not screw up you have some real talent
i am still better than you nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account
that is not entirely true
really you wanna write about me
different how different like a dwarf at a basketball game or different like a lesbian in pumps
i do not get the distinction
could everybody else tell you were different or were you the only one who knew
i felt limited i felt confined i felt like i was suffocating
i see so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist
i guess
you never know around here
is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release
write what you want just try not to make it so obvious that you are crazy about me
life must be peachy on planet ted
funny you should say peachy
i did my homework your grandfather was a peach farmer
my adoptive grandfather who knows what my biological grandfather did
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort
see you are impertinent rude sarcastic
you are so twitterpated you do not even see the miner's hat and the pickax
you are implying she is what a gold digger
second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit
why cannot you be nice to me
you have got enough people kissing your ass
put your eyeballs back in your head william randolph i am on assignment a girl has to fit in
to the best hiding place in the world
he did not he had it built
he cared enough to want you to have it
he phoned it in
i see
i doubt it
i mean my father
a father is nothing but sperm ted it takes a real man to be a dad
it is all so complicated
it is incredibly simple
and then what
then you will see who's really holding on to you
you are amazing
i know
even when you infuriate me i still want to kiss you
but you never do
if we were a team we could do anything i mean anything
in a word merk exposed
you forget i dislike you at least as much as him
he shut down your paper  you are stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches
then you will not mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week
well where the hell are you
he is on the move
i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati
let's do it
you expected whips chains merk being cattleprodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood
at least it is not another 4h meeting or a big brother barbecue
amen to that
that has more to do with your proximity to me
my desire betrays me like goosebumps on my flesh
i have a bit of a goosebump fetish not many people know that
i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy
shoes if you want to know the truth shoes are my thing
wearing them  or humping them
my fantasy is a totally naked woman wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs
that is refreshingly deviant
what about you
i am very aural
tell me more
sounds voices music humming all of it can turn me on or off like a switch
i see
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me
a portuguese boyfriend sounds very cosmo
you live and learn i realized the most important thing to me above all is trust
turned out to be a scoundrel eh i saw that one coming
you lose trust in someone and it is over done gone forever
not a chance
come on
trust is something you earn over time you do not just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire
maybe someday
but absolutely true
i know their small town mentality can be maddening
i mean your pictorial it bothers me profoundly
aw julie it is my job it is like being a doctor
you have seen one naked breast you have seem them all
which explains the continued success of heaven for how many decades
you are quick i like that
you think you are working with chimps here
the thing is i made a commitment i said i would do it and i have to keep my word
keeping your word is something i can actually respect ted
i am not going anywhere ted you are the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams
i decided to let helen run the magazine i need to go to college learn a few things you know
very ambitious i like that
the thing is i will need a first mate
i know where you can find any number of naked girls who would love to hop on board
yellow pages
let your fingers do the walking
you better
no cursing in this house young man use the strong vocabulary god gave you
i do not have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town
what having spring break ruined by will readings
charlie at a will reading what did i do to deserve this
did you have a nice flight  are they taking good care of you
yeah i am doing fine  i have so much to tell you  i do not even know where to begin
what is all this when are you coming home
just a few tokens of my affection i will be back soon do not worry
everything is lovely ted but much too expensive
mom believe me i could buy all that and the factories they came from
only the best for my mother
you promise you will finish school
i will make you very proud
but how would we pay our bills
oh goodness
you are free  you can do anything you ever wanted to do
like what
like take that trip to buckingham palace go deep sea fishing in the gulf of mexico now's your chance
forget the store think big
oh teddy we missed you so much
do not say shit honey use the strong vocabulary god gave you
thanks principal merkin
i will be blunt i know you can take it
yes sir i will brace myself
are you kidding this magazine is my dream it is every redblooded heterosexual male's dream
i never figured you for a pimp
have you ever even looked at heaven
rules are rules
come on it is our only senior prom
deaf ears mr nelson i answer to a higher power
a statue in front of city hall dedicated to principal dick merkin
i am warning you
a new pediatric wing at the hospital a presidential campaign name it anything
mr nelson you disappoint me first you break our school board rules then you break the law
what law merk having fun letting down our hair on prom night
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking
you called the cops on us
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind
i have only one concern
of course i like girls
a lot i mean a whole lot
as much as possible
you are sure
seldom no kidding
indeed it is during the day visitors prefer to be outside au naturel as it were
iuhi think she is doing fine on her own
yeah  everything's cool
you nervous why on earth should you be nervous
all those people out there it is a lot of pressure
huh you laugh in the face of pressure
i do
you are a multimedia magnate the tycoon of tits the baron of bottoms
the supreme sovereign of sexuality
whoa butthat is the thing  i have never even actually
why look who's here
i was like a different person tonight
you were the new and improved you
i would have been laughed right out of xenia
no one will be laughing at you now ted you can take that to the bank
it is really going to be strange going home in a couple of days
i have been very lazy for a long long time
you seem like you are anything but lazy uncle billy
really so i am doing ok
he was in a league of his own
i cannot wait to see the pictures
it was incredible the light the crowd everything
seriously i am doing all right
i wish i knew you years ago when my brother was alive i wish he never gave you up
thanks uncle billy thanks for everything
you are a great kid do not you forget it
my job back off benedict
all is fair in heaven tedbaby
that is right and guess who's the new king of the unemployment line
aw come on kid throw me a bone i am your uncle for gosh sakes
people pay good money for that
i am just a messenger
it is about your parents
it is spring break i do not want to go to a will reading
i am seventeen i know it like the back of my hand
your fathered owned the entire heaven empire  you own it now any questions
i have the feeling they got it down already  they are a step ahead of us artie
kelly van ryan
 is accusing me of rape  jimmy told me  apparently i am the last to know
i you know i
eat a power bar
i was thinking antigua maybe
i love antigua  maybe i will come visit you
i would like that
we can get blood type right away dental records will take longer  you want dna that can take weeks
the teeth doing any talking
ray  stop calling  i told you the dental records will take time
what about the blood
could be hers  types match  could be a lot of other people's too
second you get something on those teeth i want it
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions
about suzie
actually i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette
he used to come around here  he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the glades
she still work there
she had it before she drank herself to death  was not exactly a love child
suzie  then you are not her grandmother
and the other girl kelly  suzie's niece
i am fine  nice tv
i just want to get it over with  my mom's making me do this i just want to forget it
i know you do
take your time
they were in me  both places you know
i understand
yes  i said stop  i screamed  i mean that is how it sounded in my head  he hurt me
i he had my wrists pinned behind me i remember my hands were cold'
then what
he kept saying let it happen let it happen  then he just stopped
you mean he withdrew
again  i think we covered this  i told her i was going to call a cab
suzie toller is missing
ray thinks she was murdered
you could tell me where you were last night
back to the land of grownups
the skinny brunette
it is a shithole  but she was dirty what was i gonna do
lombardo's settlement
unless you are setting up sandra van ryan for the big payday
you got it  the rich got richer  while the saps like lombardo went bellyup in the swamp
i net a guy in a bar
you could say that
ray  we do not know anything yet  she could be anywhere
you have someplace to be
just check out the car
those are suzie toller's teeth
where is the body
you do not think sam could have put it there
we do not know that ray
ray you heard him
and if the teeth are not suzie's  you will give this up
if i am wrong about those teeth  it is a promise
where is lombardo
he is leaving the country  and i do not give a shit
the blood type on the rocks matches suzie's
yeah maybe a little
why is that
he dropped jimmy off first
i guess
no  he stopped by himself  okay that is all  let me go
what was that
he said no little bitch can ever make me come
you know what that will mean for lombardo
i do not care  you heard that girl's statement  i think he is dirty  get me a case
the line i get on this guy is that he is done half the women in blue bay
what about witnesses
we have got three  guy mowing his yard couple of kids playing hoops
and what do they say
you heard kelly say sam  that was lombardo on the phone  and you saw the girls
i told kelly van ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder  i did her rights
you did not cuff her
suzie toller's  and that is the only thing saving your sorry ass
yeah okay he did
and then what he touched you  did you maybe flirt a little
i wanna go home now
shit what difference does it make nobody's gonna believe me anyway
suzie  did this man rape you
okay  he did  he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me  now can i go home
i am sorry you said it hurt  why
i said he did
ms toller  i am asking you now under oath did samuel lonbardo rape you
i am sorry
hey man at least in study hail i could meditate
yeah  but i got my bike
you and suzie used to come out here together
yeah sometimes  lots of the kids hang out here  you really think something bad happened to suzie
lombardo ever come out here
no  but i mean just the idea that mr lombardo would
way i hear it he was pretty tight with the kids one of the guys
yeah but
i am scared that is what  i am scared there's no one to trust
you can trust me
oh for christ's sake
you are
are you retarded or just brain dead from whiffing fumes out there in the swamp
what brain
i think we just need to get wasted
curiosity i guess
about what  how to improve your breast stroke
you all gonna go down to the caribbean together

this is a highly irregular procedure this is absolutely unprecedented
oh  help me the balloongs going up
yes viktor davidov miss
doctor jones christmas jones no jokes ive heard them all
dont know any doctor jokes
couldnt make it splitting headache
so who are you
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens
alright then brunch
then its no longer a bomb
its a bomb alright were still dead if the trigger charge goes off
i did kill us she thinks were dead and she thinks she got away with it
what the hell are you talking about
elektra king
elektra king  are you insane  this is her pipeline
makes her look even more innocent
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium
i was hoping you could tell me
elektra would control it all
we go down to the torpedo bay
hes going to insert the plutonium
like riding a bike
just wanted to put him on edge
count to twenty  ill be there
we cant
so isnt it time you unwrapped your present
i need you to pass me fit now molly
james  it wouldnt really be
perhaps after this  test
quite the opposite in fact
shes not a girl anymore
its barely a scratch the dome broke my fall
well at least it turned out to have some purpose
i took the initiative
you havent been given an assignment in this case
i was the one who brought that money in
im well aware of your stake in this 007 if you have a point get to it
the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra
now robert is dead he got his revenge
then robert was right about a russian connection
is maybethe inside woman
which is neutral no doubt
who did you get it from
i am just a middle man i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss
your last chance take the money
your last chance give me the name
stripped of all your weaponry you still threaten me
i cant tell you  alright alright but you must protect me
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva
consider me ungrateful
you even brought the plane for us  we really couldnt have done it without you
havent you heard the news  so is she
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs
a word im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover
you knew him well
im sorry
he died before he could complete his lifelong dream  i intend to finish it for him
funerals arent exactly memorable
partially yes
my bodyguard he follows me everywhere hes decisive vigilant  and he makes an excellent omelette
how long has he been with you
since the kidnapping why do you ask
its my fathers pin he wore it everyday of his life
you are wrong mr bond in fact i am the only person who can do it
always wanted to see the upper lines
you dont take no for an answer do you
were alright
youre not going to
its the only way out
i know
i think youre one of the bravest people ive ever met
you should rest
then take me with you
no youll be safe here
i dont want to be safe
i have to go to work
two shaken not stirred
you had your chance james now im looking for a bigger thrill
not at that price time to surrender
or did you steal it from your old friend renard
you can drop the act its over
i dont know what youre talking about
i think you do
you do what you have to do but ive called in m  shes en route from london even now
not interested
soon shell be everywhere
five more turns and your neck will break
just like youonly you were even easier
he killed me he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom
it is my oil  mine and my familys
elektra its not too late  eight million people neednt die
oh james
bondjamesbond what brings you here
you of course i need some information
how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with stateoftheart russian army weapons
what  this is not possible
where did you get this
off a highpowered paraski that was trying to kill me
how high up does thisarms dealing go
bond if someone wants you dead it is renard our government has nothing to gain by killing you
but you would have something to gain by killing robert king and stopping his pipeline
shes no innocent  this is my nuclear consultant
ah i see  a purelyplutonic relationship
whats your business with elektra king
i thought you were the one in her business
you are out of your league  shes working with renard
a rope
and the payoff on the tables
a special job  aaa submarine
no  get me out
this is too big for even you  where is it
the right kind of explosion in the right spot  it would block the bosphorus cut off the black sea
how appropriate
id heard there were some renovations thereno one would look for a sub in that place in a million years
former kgb surveillance post the dye factory was just a front now it turns a good profit
couldcould you come
is nothing  his kingdom he stole from my mother the kingdom i will rightly take back
who  bond  bond is dead
how would you know
of course
what do you think
no  it is the beginning the world will never be the same
yes  au revoir
and expensive  cost three million plus
anywhere in this circle  iran iraq pakistan syria afghanistan
its heading for the oil terminal
where it can do the most damage
still no contact yet
laurie i will have to ask you to come with me
why  that is the problem
i cannot tell you that  it is quite urgent
i would like to use the bathroom 
well sir    in a worstcase scenario    we would assume that twentyfive percent of the russian birds get through
what about the aftermath  this socalled    nuclear winter theory
we do not really know sir but bluntly our survival capability    may depend on a quirk of the weather
the weather  i see  keep me posted  i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions
you oughta see upstairs  it is a slaughterhouse
no idea who's behind this
small army from the looks of it  he put up one hell of a fight
walter  you are just telling me what you think i want to hear
wrong answers
who is she  do you know her
why doctor  i did  he was a bad dog
god is not there to do it
we do not know that
hello adrian
we have lost a colleague  the comedian is dead
that is your theory
life and death are unquantifiable abstracts  they do not concern me
you mean afghanistan  it will not require my attention  what i am doing here is far more interesting
jon  get back  you do not understand
yes  i heard this morning  washingtongs asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol
is it time  d'you have to leave for the funeral
not yet there's plenty of time
mm hmm
i could stay and go
   and just how would you manage that
collect me
it will happen laurie  i have already seen it  neither of us can do anything to change it
jesus jon i nearly choked to  where are we 
yes  in about    thirty seconds for example you will tell me you are sleeping with dreiberg
you  you know about me and dan
well i just you just said  do not act surprised
yes i loved you  i left the earth when i lost you
yet you must have known all along that you would give me cancer  just be being with me
i did not give you cancer laurie  not you not the others  i do not know what did
but you knew that i would  die
always  ever since the day i died
i am sorry  look  there's a gas storm on the valles marineris   
oh god  i am no more than a bug on a windshield to you
you are the only human being i care for
you have the power to do it  i want you to do it  please
i explained this  i cannot  that is not the way it happens
jon  if you ever loved me  if there's anything human left in you  then do it
cured yes
jon  what
the south pole  times flowing backwards
veidts complex
jon  for gods sake what do you see
i see what the watchmaker made  i see the universe
my god  murdered   that is this have to do with rorschach

we would better hope so   it is almost time
psychotic pig  he had it coming  mr ctu   
now wait  we all had the same option as blake  it was work for the government or do time
fine but the civil terrorism unit  it is a fucking gestapo  dirty tricks  political assassinations 
damn straight  we were heroes
of course we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits
oh yeah  the one that used to confess to everything  hoping we would beat him up
that is the one  whatever happened to him
he pulled it on rorschach    and rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft
you are sure
his    whatever
i am not his    whatever  okay
sure  it works  i mean look at this face daniel  i am thirtyeight years old
i do not mind getting older  i am obsolete anyway  why try to hide it
are you kidding  if they put him in jail he is dead  he will never get to trial
one more down  someone tried to kill adrian     first time i have ever heard him scared
i know what you are thinking  you would be a lot safer if i were not around
with any luck the world will end before we get ours
memory lane
 i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check
you and me
what are you up to
do not look  turn around
it is a peace rally  the ctu's just opened fire on the crowd
oh laurie  jesus  no

i do not want to take 'em out  just want to keep 'em interested

that detroit shit  i am so worried
yes you are

i think he is going to the john
my god  we bust him out of jail in the middle of a riot and he stops to take a 
will you two lovebirds keep it down
what now  fly south  hook up with adrian
trying to change the past  he said it was the only way to save the world 
where did he go
those cars  what year is this
everything's changed

control senator  we teach them control

enough for a test
and i will never understand terrorists
i am trying to save our kind charles you should do the same
not at the cost of lives max
still trying to make the world safe for our kind  still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves  definitively
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me max what is it like these days

i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble
yes my dear he is

a god

and i have mine
why do not we talk inside
well   perhaps for a few minutes
it would not be fair to her
yes i know
you have got to help me to remain faithful

why do not we all turn in  it is been a long day
you cannot expect to iron out all the kinks in one night
