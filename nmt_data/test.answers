fuck what the fuck is going on 
what do we do
did  did you 
what about pike
he is the only one unaccounted for
this is not our area whose area is this 
hey i   holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
you killed him you fucking faggot 
we got  i do not know we got separated
before or after the explosion  mueller 
west was one thing but this 
we finished the course and came here then heard an explosion   where is pike
what about you wandering around alone at least we have an alibi 
holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
yeah right
why not
i asked for a policeman
you are under military arrest it is not gonna happen that is wrong with baseball
it is too slow
well it is a game of anticipation that is the beauty
i just do not like it
i do not know i like the army
c'mon ray everyone hates the army during basic i will tell you straight i hated it here
there's no need
why would you ask for a cop ray
i am not telling you what happened
and those were the guys who went on the exercise with you
hey ray just had a nice talk with your buddy kendall  seems you killed three people
that son of a bitch
that would be my reaction too 
he is lying
well why did not you say so we will just drop all your charges then 
i did not shoot west 
i apologize 
you saw west's body
you shot childs and nunez
they would have killed us both you want me to write a confession i will write a confession
you saved kendall's life 
we are not finished yet 
we do not need the tapes 
oh you do not what else do you have on me you have not found any bodies yet have you
he  he made me do it 
do what
i guess nunez was not dead after all he came after us with a vengeance  you know the rest
and the bodies
i promised them i would ask you where west and the others are
washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead
that first night with pike i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
he said he worked there 
no did he tell you about it about the business childs ran
what business
what about the phosphorous grenade
back up
why did not you tell us all this in the first place
is that what i did now and of course you can prove all of it
ohhhh i do not think so
cadet that is your name
sir dunbar sir
you know how to work a pistol dunbar
sir yes sir
what the fuck is going on
he would not kill anybody
jesus what happened
pike and i got separated then i heard gunfire close
whose blood is that jay
what do you mean west's
where have you been jay
roberto what the fuck
you know it is not like that 
you gotta untie me  i did not do this thing ray
you hated west more than any of us
maybe but that do not make me a killer 
you are the only one missing a grenade
that is exactly what he says about you
you hated west mueller loved him 
combat grade morphine mueller sold it to me
you are lying 
why why did not you tell me
that still does not mean you did not kill him
you saw west right how was he killed
full clip to the body 
from up close or far away
i i do not know
what do not you know
a test will no doubt link you to the killing 
you i have seen you around the base but you  you are not army are you
i have done nothing wrong  i am the victim here
you said you wanted to know what happened  i am telling you the truth
what happened to degrees
i did not kill him 
but you did not
he admitted it
okay i think that is it he rises and walks to the door
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar 
how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten
epileptic attacks are murder on your system rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer
is it the truth
something funny levi
jail if he is lucky the gas chamber if he is not 
how do you know
or you levi when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him
i did not 
you lied to us levi you are going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them
i do not know 
maybe what 
how are you
been better  i read about that is been happening with you i should have called 
that bad
would i have called you if it was not if there was any other way 
this is warrant officer julia osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator
i am assuming that is what made him the dead one
which gives us about five hours why would you call me
the guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop
he is not done by a longshot i can get more out of him 
pike killed west dunbar killed mueller childs and nunez
who killed pike
we have already been over the terrain twice nothing
there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it
habeas corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime
okay then let's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car 
nevertheless what' kendall will testify and that will be enough
you mean not enough to save you
tom where are you going 
home i am done
what i said before 
that is horseshit and you know it
they are taking your command are not they
i am sorry bill
do not be i am not cut out to deal with the west's of the world
you are a good soldier bill
you are drunk 
stay where you are
or what you have gone round the bend 
for the last time i have no idea what you are talking about 
hostile and uncooperative
ah christ
you knew sergeant west
i did not mean that as a compliment
sergeant west's served for twenty three years he is the public face of the modern army
gotta be honest i love what you have done with the place 
you and the colonel go back
it was for suspicion of bribery it is really all in the wording 
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside i am not comfortable having you involved in this
hurricane knocked out our mainframe so all we have are their dogtags cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall 
levi who names their kid levi 
senator jonathan kendall of ohio
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which does not exactly put people at ease is he cute
excuse me
is dunbar cute
good copbad cop
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars 
you really want to make banal chit chat like that now
you are right we should sit in silence
we are in the middle of a murder case 
typical army brat story dad was noncom mom was a nurse there was never any real doubt of joining up
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
something like that you
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about is not it
the very same
you do understand that there's absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right
i plan to grow on you
you are off to a late start
you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here
imagine what it must have been like for them out there what do you think of dunbar
he is telling the truth up to a point
something wrong
being back here gives me the willies
remember he is the son of a senator so go easy kid gloves
that was kid gloves
but we have to question him   thought you did not have cigarettes 
too neat how long have you been an investigator
i just he came back for kendall i do not think he is capable of murder
why the fuck was not he in restraints
goddammit hardy you cannot just leave 
watch me
you did more than try you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator you are phenomenal 
at least you and kendall agree on that
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin 
that bugs you too
little bit
we are fucked i know 
are you sure
why do not you talk to levi off the record for a second
i pushed him too hard
you could not have known 
yeah i could have should have
so what now
now i go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
for what
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down
hardy what are you doing 
we can tie you to the chair if it will work better for you 
hardy for chrissakes 
no bodies no west
that is not true
there are degrees of truth officer always degrees
do i have a choice in this
what are you doing out here
leaving without saying goodbye what are you gonna do
go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
your phone number
he was your friend
the thing is we have got a real opportunity here you turn me in tomorrow and we are both fucked 
pike please 
maybe we should not go
the faggot speaks
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
they found him poor fucker was practically blown in half 
poor fucker my ass
pike and i got separated 
yeah and he does not know when 
i remember now it was before the explosion 
oh you remember now 
i was freezing from the hurricane 
we just want 
he could not kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own
he said what
you are gonna die tonight faggot clear as day
no one else heard it
nunez was chasing dunbar
because he would shot mueller
pike never confessed
running out of time are we tick tock ticktock how long till your witnesses fly the coop
dunbar says you were
dunbar's telling the truth
wrong answer 
what happened with nunez
hurricane's due after midnight and we are still going out
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first 
thank god
this place is going mueller we gotta move 
where is your shirt mueller
goddammit ray we gotta get out of here 
cadet michael mueller i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west 
the fuck are you talking about 
until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west's body 
tell him to shut up 
funny i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning
no no that was cadet dunbar 
this is totally unnecessary 
he asked to see a policeman we are getting him a policeman
he is not army it is not official 
what do you think
you want kendall do not you
we know
you never told me why you got kicked out of
cannot thank you enough mr sebastian if you had not come along
we are not used to the big city where we come from it is not so easy to get lost
you certainly have a nice place here
he knows what he is doing
if he will not cooperate
i am sure glad you found us sebastian  what do you think mary
that is the point
not to be trapped
one man  he must be good
then go get him
yeah  it might be better if we talk in private sebastian  why do not you go home
i am surprised you did not come to me sooner
it is not an easy thing to meet your maker
and what can he do for you
can the maker repair what he makes
would you like to be modified
had in mind something a little more radical
i want more life fucker
also you are too valuable to experiment with
i have done some questionable things
also extraordinary things
how about breakfast i was just going to make some
if it would not be too much of a bother a little bite to eat would be
oh no bother i would be glad to
why are you staring at us
what sebastian
what generation are you
show me something
we have a lot in common
you mean that you cannot come here and i cannot go there
not only that but we have smiliar problems  accelerated decrepitude but we do not want to die quite yet
of course not
you could help us
i do not know much about biomechanics roy  i wish i did but you are out of my league
what about your friend the man who owns this building
he is not really my friend  i just do a job for him now and then
tyrell could help us sebastian
he could
his company made us
i would be happy to mention it to him
when do you deliver your project
you are our best and only friend
where are you going sebastian
just thought i would
that is going on down there
this is my uncle roy sebastian
then we are stupid and we will die
i think therefore i am

nerves of steel

they will change the limit before i change my mind
you sure
why did not you go
too old
my job is here
i would like  you to take a look at these pictures
the girl that does not look like that girl
nothing  she wanted to know about suck night
book the good ones for where
lots of places  the tours the clubs the silicone shows private parties
there's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place
i do not know nothing about it
what the fuck for
it that mother real
of course he is not real  you think i would be working here if i could afford a real snake
it is a good job
the best
does it eat
you would be surprised what a guy will go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body
i bet i would
it is artificial
are you apprehensive
why should i be
i would not accept it  also i would report the person who gave it to me to the police
i would take him to the doctor
you are watching tv and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist
in a magazine you come across a fullpage photo of a nude girl
you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend and you decide to get an abortion
i would never get an abortion
why not
that would be murder mr deckard
in your opinion
it would be my child
is there anything else
i know you think it complicates your work but i am here to help
i have already got more help than i need
sounds like i am an asshole either way but the answer is still no
two of us might be more effective than one
i can imagine
do not just stand there looking at me  it is not polite
you ever take a bath with a man before
i told you i would come back
you did
who is this
me and my dad
how come you are not on the job
i am  part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out
how are you doing
what do people do in the afternoon
do you dream
yeah  sometimes
nobody is freer than when he dreams  i read that
have you ever cleaned your apartment
do not be fooled by appearances
they could clean around the arrangement
but if i do not plug it in how can i
never mind the plug just go through the motions
but then how can you
this feels stupid
you are sick deckard
have you ever known anybody a long time
that is a long time
ten years
why do you call it retire why do not you call it murder
because it is not
do not you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
andies only simulate suffering  if they are programmed for it
do you think i simulated what happened between us
do not leave here  do not open the door do not answer the phone
what difference will it make
where the hell you been
you know where i been  i been on vacation
next time you go on vacation do me a favor let us know where it is
that is up
severed spine  you would better get in here  bryant's waiting for you
may i ask a personal question
go ahead
but in your profession that is a risk
nothing is infallible but so far the voightkampff scale bas been foolproof
like you said mr deckard a machine can be a hazard  the voightkampff scale is a machine is not it
one that relies on human interpretation  where is the subject
if she is the machine works
she did not know
how many questions does it usually take mr deckard
we are going to have to start the sequence again if you do not stay with me deckard  concentrate
how do you know i am not

nice car
she is my baby
how long have you worked at the casino
coming up to two years now  but i was away for six months
you have done pretty well
i am off to a little watering hole why do not you join me relax
look matt there's something i have to say to you i saw you cheating
what the fuck are you talking about
that greek guy who won at the end you paid him out in 25s not 20s
i do not cheat jack you have got it wrong
what are you a cop
you are talking about complicity
who are these guys
mostly people in the casino business a few drug dealers
and the girls
just girls what are you drinking
vodka straight on the rocks
does bella come here
hey jack join us
no thanks
do not worry i will not report you
i cannot give you a lift back tonight
rough day
what happened to bella
i am sorry sir that is a late bet
what are you talking about it is 11 i have won with this lady
you have won with the two chips you placed earlier but the third chip was a late bet
i put them on together
you do not recognise me you had me barred you fucking little worm
wait a minute you got yourself barred
where did you go to school
i was at beadles
do you have a salon prive
i have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond
we check every four days
why four and not three or five
stacks of 20 rows of 5
any exceptions
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours
you use two alternating do not you
we do 
where is the magnet
have not you forgotten something
i do not think so
not with your own cloth besides your pockets will be stitched
what happens if i want to sneeze
what makes you so sure
it is a rule always stand by your first count the odds are you are right
you want me to check
what for
for the database it can be accessed by every casino in the country we have the same system for punters
next point friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden
we had the same rule at sun city but it was impossible to check
this is not south africa we would know because someone would report it believe me someone always does
does know or does report what would happen if i knew something like that and did not report it
this is our crow's nest i am showing it to you now but you will never see it again
very impressive
i just want the job
why do not you take a break jack
mr tchai always likes to play at that table and only with bella
does he win
he is paying out in stacks of 25
thanks for the information
a pleasure pity about bella
good morning mongrels
good morning
that is all the gusta you can musta i said good morning
good morning
now that is better but i still sense some students out there who are afraid just to say good morning
good morning
are you afraid
hi that is going on here
horrible accident my neighbour he got killed
what happened
what was his name
 and be able to find one of these wormholes
a wormhole with an einsteinrosen bridge which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man
like a delorean
each vessel travels along a vector path through spacetime along its centre of gravity
like a spear
beg pardon
could these wormholes appear in nature
that is highly unlikely you are talking about an act of god
if god controls time then all time is predecided then every living thing travels along a set path
not if you chose to stay within god's channel
when can i squeeze one out
why do i have to sleep with donnie he stinks
when you fall asleep tonight i am gonna fart in your face
what happens if you tell mom and dad about this samantha

but my sleeping is really fucked up
have you ever read any anna akhmatova
i think she is great
me too there's this poem 
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
i think before
seems too coincidental that way
do you know her poem that starts seaside gusts of windand a house in which we do not live
i wish we did you married
um no
what are you doing
c'mon man the water's fine nobody's coming here tonight believe me this place is closed up electricity's off
i hesitated for what seemed like forever
i knew
i knew by your nervousness that naomi was not the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
it is dark
ahha now i can look for candles matches and the liquor cabinet
what if you stay this time
i walked out the door there's no more memory
bye joel
do not worry it is really solid this time of year
i do not know what if it breaks

i am nervous too
yeah i would not have thought that
well you obviously do not know me
says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling
says you were a bully
a bully moi
that is what it says you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
well sounds like me sorry man  says you were jealous and suspicious
says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it
i do not know
does not sound like me
i cannot stop thinking about you
yay meet me after work by the old mill
what old mill is that somewhere we 
what took you so long
i just walked in
hmmm do you miss me

it was like nothing was there and then justin appeared and the core became metal
no he did not
you were not there i saw it
i do not know what happened to justin
i am telling you i saw it
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
is that an offer
that is happening
let me breathe let me breathe
how the bridge is gone
there must be a way what about engineering
can you shut it down
i do not know the process dr weir was the expert
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement
to conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity anyone who can should get some sleep
he will live if we ever make it back
what is it
i have been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
they thought it said liberatis me save me but it is not me it is tutemet save yourself
it is not a distress call it is a warning
do you hear it right there
hear what
it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell
dj the clark's gone smith and cooper are dead
what happened
oh god dj what do i how do i
please kill
that is wrong
that is happening
that is wrong
90 over 50 and falling 
intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood
his peritoneum has ruptured
you wanted to see me admiral
incredible these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this this happened this is not some kind of hoax
i would not bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and id codes
thank you
it is not that simple  lyle play the recording for dr weir
does he know that
it is been two years since she died he is over it
i want our best people on this where is miller
what justin what shows you
it will not stop it goes on and on and on
what does
it is inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left
the dark inside i do not understand
how do you know all this
you have reached the first containment seal the engineering decks are on the other side
we still have pressure the radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour
i have reached another containment door this thing's huge
that is the second containment seal beyond that engineering
everything green on my boards skipper
justin finish your sweep
but i cannot i gotta get out of here skipper please
this is weir
since the initial transmission there's been no further contact just the beacon every two minutes
the crew could they still be alive
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months they are been gone seven years
that is the hold up
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers  good for four months
we have got pressure
jesus its huge
that means they did not abandon ship
peters is right no one's here
i can see the hatch
the blood came from somewhere peters
okay i am on the bridge
everything's been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull it is intact
justin check the containment for radiation leaks peters
you okay
peters i want you to go through the ship's log see if we cannot find some answers
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up
peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us
i have been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space
where has it been for the last seven years
what does it say
that is the engineering containment and there's the main airlock we can dock there
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
dr weir i need you on the bridge
captain i did not come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
once the ship is secured we will bring you on board 
you are in the central corridor it connects the personnel areas to engineering
easy peters we are okay we are okay let's finish the sweep
no one
it beats dying mister smith
what could cause them  that is in the core
it is complicated
if it worked
i want this room sealed the second containment is off limits
you have something dr weir
the date
what about it
the event horizongs computer think's it is 2034
it is 2041
what the hell is that dr weir
we do not get the power back our air's gonna go bad
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
is that your expert opinion the only answer we have had out of you is i do not know
what do you want me to say
to what where did this ship go where did you send it
i do not know
where has it been for the past seven years
i do not know
we are leaving
do not do not do this
you you cannot do that
i told you she will not let you leave
your eyes
i do not need them anymore where we are going we will not need eyes to see
if you miss me you will blow out the hull you will die too
weir is dead
then who the fuck are you
what are you
you know
you want me to believe you are the devil well i do not that is bullshit
i am not the devil
then what what are you tell me
there is no devil there is no god there is only nothing
heading threethreefour
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings
i guess we are about to find out keep us slow and steady
yes sir
we have got some weather
1500 meters we are getting too close
put it through tacs smith you up for a flyby
it is now  we are locked in
captain miller
smith where the hell have you been
do we have enough time for a weld
no one's dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks
captain miller you copy
thank you
captain we got a problem
now what
she was right behind me i turn around she is gone she could be anywhere
what is it smith
smith get out of there
come again skipper
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock
no no we just got her back together
where is it where is it
ion drive will engage in tminus ten minutes
starck why are not you on the bridge
i just finished drying
crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
something's wrong with the bioscan
that is an affirmative
everybody okay
we are all here
it tastes bad
how much ohtwo do we have
oxygen is not the problem
carbon dioxide
it is building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot
that is causing the readings
i can reconfigure the scan for c12 amylase proteins
maybe one of the original crew
what is it starck
i ran the bioscan with the dnarna filter the results were bioreadings of indeterminate origin
bioreadings of indeterminate origin do not you have anything useful to tell me
you have got to listen
it is not bullshit it is the only conclusion the data supports
starck do you know how crazy that sounds it is impossible
if you knew it was impossible then why would you waste my time
what i want is to survive the next ten hours
miller come in
that is going on in there starck
he is awake he is in the airlock he is not wearing a suit
i am on my way starck
tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can
weir cannot be alive
weir activated the drive he is sending us to the other place
blow the fucker up
i will do it 
we are armed this fucker's ready to blow
repeat we are armed
he is been past mars
he served on the goliath
here's another one they are all over the place
dr weir that is this the door to
yes we can see some kind of mist what is that
blood looks like arterial spray
can you see a body
no i saw nothing
is not it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
there's no one in the corridor but us
he is engaged the override
yes yes justin we heard it
keep him talking
almost got it
we have to do something oh god
you got any coffee
it is cold
where is she
jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker
what the hell is that
the safety circuit is failed
i did not see anything and i do not have to see anything this ship is fucked
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
30 hours to neptune orbit
you cannot do that
if they are they are screening their calls
the scope is lit it is right in front of us
range 500 meters and holding turbulence is dropping off
what happened to his eyes
explosive decompression
miller do you read me peters 
get them back 
what if the air has gone bad we cannot wear these suits forever
a straight line
the reactor's still hot we have got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious
what is it
what is it
it must be hard being so far away from her
yes i miss her she died two years now
what are you doing
in our current environment dr weir selfcontrol is an asset
what is it
the forward airlock
justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean
what is that to you evil as you are
i am as he made me in his own image
you drove him to his torment
and he drove me to mine
then why weep for him
i have never been shown a kindness show me one now
what kindness
i am glad you finally came to the door a man should not have to scurry in the shadows
i am very very ugly people are afraid except you
you are an outcast
yes i have been seeking my friends
friends do they live around here
yes very close
people can be kinder than you think
come warm yourself if you like
the letters in your journal that and a geography book  your elizabeth sounds lovely
kill me and have done with it
kill you hardly that
fine words from a child killer you who murdered my brother
your crime as well as mine
how dare you you are disgusting and evil
evil  do you believe in evil
why victor why what were you thinking
materials nothing more
i do not know
what can i do
a companion a female like me so she will not hate me
yes i want this over and done with
why her

a brain extremities
this was not taken from a grave
what does it matter she will live again you will make her
you will honor your promise to me
she is beautiful
she is not for you
get away from her she is mine
poor william what indignant tears
that is the nature of all progress william do not let your brother sway you otherwise
elizabeth really he is quite mad
scandalous what would your dear mother say
you dance so beautifully together
must have been a terrible row
nothing still nothing
it is been months it is not like him
something's wrong i know it  i have heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg
so have i
he always was opinionated
have you seen willie
is he not back yet
claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time they say he never arrived
do not cry elizabeth
are you sure it cannot hurt us
how could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her
victor have a care you will make him dizzy
smell the air wonderful
quite a sendoff is not it
father's so proud
and you
prouder still you will be the handsomest student there
i will have to do better than that
i have loved you all my life
this feels incestuous
brother and sister still
i wish to be your husband
i wish to be your wife
only you
you make me weak
our decision together
your decision for us
i give you my soul
until our wedding night when our bodies will join
victor i love you
my mind was not playing tricks he was there in the storm gloating over his crimes challenging me to come
but why risk yourself has not this family suffered enough
i have no choice
if what you say is true it is a matter for the police
do you know this man is there something between you
i thought i would never see you again
what sort of task
it is not something i can explain now perhaps someday
what of our marriage victor we have had so much tragedy i want this family to live again
so do i
no not tomorrow not next week marry me today
why the change what about your work
it was misguided and pointless is your answer yes
it is
we will leave this afternoon right after the ceremony pack only what you need
does this have something to do with that man you saw
yes we are in danger here every moment we stay
victor tell me why trust me
brother and sister no more
it is going to ram us
captain i implore you the men are frightened and angry they want your assurance
they knew the risks when they signed on i have come too far to turn back now
a warming wind
this ice will break yet  how is our guest
he died raving about phantoms he was mad poor devil  gather a detail have the body removed from my cabin
you are saying all disease will eventually be eradicated
i am convinced not by treating symptoms but by diving nature's most jealouslyguarded secrets
do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes
no but someday
i was just clearing my throat
i am not mad
are you having me on
henry clerval
victor victor frankenstein
do you really think i am mad
rich old ladies and their daughters
can you think of a better reason
quite a few
the entire school heard it it was not something one could miss
you are a comfort to me henry
what now writing about it in your journal will not help
only you would think of that
and here's to him everything in moderation frankenstein
they just caught the man who did it
he was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance
they will hang him all the same
keep your voice down you do not know what you are saying
you are making a scene
why waldman he of all people should have cheated death
you cannot death is god's will
i resent god's monopoly
that is blasphemy
blasphemy be damned waldman spent his life trying to help people
all the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor
no he had more important work
victor this has got to stop  nobody's seen you in months you have not attended a single class
that is my concern  i am involved in something just now i want to finish it in waldmangs memory
how much longer
you have been going roundtheclock
we catch a few hours sleep where we can usually here at your bedside
everything in moderation clerval
no they do not
quite a place
thank you henry
for what
what happened up there
are you sure you will be all right
only if you will tell me who he is
all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave by my hand
i have always loved him
or albertus magnus cornelius agrippa
what is your name
victor frankenstein sir  of geneva
you seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum
professor waldman
victor explain yourself
krempe has a way of provoking my temper
you disdain accepted wisdom
i doubt that decision is still mine to make
reconfigure the leads
victor he was trying to be gracious
you are awake i have prepared some broth it will help restore you
frostbite gangrene a simple diagnosis
are you a physician
ah an explorer
wouldbe i am plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment
i heard
i cannot say i blame them we are trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of creature
creature a human like creature
you know of it
your men are right to be afraid
then explain it whatever it is it could save the voyage i have spent years planning this my entire fortune
you would persist at the cost of your own life the lives of your crew
who are you
miss me baby
it is a bitch
a bitch
did not recognize you
we have never met
i wonder who will recognize us first they will wet their pants
i hope the men do  i would rather the women did not
home  jesus  i am like this  home
home is important to a man
used to be against the law did not it
i suppose
you know what gets me
looseleafwill you get the hell home
at least we found the diamonds
at least
i would really feel stupid if we did not bring anything back home
it is enough that you have brought yourself home
i wish you would tell alice that  and that goddamn mrs wheeler
tell them yourself
you do not know my motherinlaw boy
after eight years in the jungle with you i know mrs wheeler better than i know anybody in the universe
i did not tell you everything
this room is full of ghosts

you know what gets me
let's talk about it some other time
how short the skirts are
good night colonel  it is been beautiful
i have been looking at motorcycles

and how were things
otherwise how are things
could have happened to anybody
first nagasakinow this
i dunno boy

that is funny about that
excuse me
how do you know that
when we were up in the tree so longwith the bats
oh  i would forgotten
go to the funeral
of course  not only go to it but go to it in full uniform  rent a uniform
that is against the law is not it i cannot wear a uniform anymore
wear your uniform and every decoration and let them despise you if they dare
i did not know we had any women left
the world is teeming with women ours to enjoy
i told you the uniform would not help
it helped more than you know  down deep people were deeply affected
so kidhow they hanging  or do not you say that to a little kid
of course you will go  you are going to fly the helicopter
i dunno
all the more reason to go to africa
i dunno you know  i used to really love that alice do you know that
you know her for what she is now garbage
hi penelope
go live in a safedeposit boxwith your things looseleaf jesusi would not want to be married to him  you know
that is this
i would not want to be married to me we are too crazy  you know
in what way pray tell
i did not like that violin thing that was sad
tit for tatas simple as that
you never played a violin
okay  okay
you are an imbecile
i know you think that
everybody thinks that
anybody who would drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb
the one direct decisive intelligent act of your life
i do not think so  it could have been
how are you honeybunch
is penelope in
the posies are for her
i wanted to apologize
you have come to the right man
i forgot my vacuum cleaner
i forget mine for years on end
i cannot get over how you guys are my friends  harold ryan and looseleaf harper are my friends
our pleasure
are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die
i would rather go to viet nam
would somebody please pass me the catsup
what you say is pass the fucking catsup
what an awful sound
it is possible of course that you will die in africa
i have considered that
selling vacuum cleaners is not the best preparation you could have
i just want one true adventure before i die
fifty years
you are making a joke
i am interested in longterm expectations
it is engineered to last about fifteen years
if i were married to him i sure would not walk out
we got to get another pilot
for what
for africa
do you really think that harold ryan would go to africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman
you invited me
to make an ass of yourself
gee whiz
it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us
i would not drop my gun
you are hollow like a woman
how do you know how i would act in africa
look how you are acting now  this is a moment of truth and you are almost crying  slug me
you are my buddy
out  out
youyou are not going to have any friends left if you do not watch out
anybody home
you were about to ask a question
are youdo you
ask it
do you know who wanda june is
life has denied me that thrill
dr woodly
dr woodly  i should make a little list
is anybody besides you here now
the doctor was called away on an emergency  i think it was birth
where is mom
you do not know where your mother is does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night
she went to the fight with herb shuttle i guess
you think you could find me a pencil and paper
man and boy
everybody says he was so brave
even thisherb shuttle you said
he worships father
ah  and what sort of man is this worshiper
that is good about that
harold the patron saint of taxidermy
what does he doof an athletic nature
nothing  he plays a violin in a doctors' quartet
aha  he has a brilliant military record i am sure
he was a stretcherbearer in the korean war  were you in a war with father
big ones little ones teenyweeny onesjust and otherwise
tell me some true stories about dad
oh hell
the sting
as in death where is thy sting he killed at least fifty men wounded hundreds more
tell me that
i saw your father fight major siegfried von konigswald the beast of yugoslavia hand to hand
do not care for cold steel  a knife is worse than a bullet
i do not know
the story gets hairier  should i stop
the name will live forever  it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia  mhravitch
when i grow up i am going to go to mhravitch
i wanted to go out for football but mom was afraid i would get hurt
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that
they are not engaged
he seems to think they are  he told me that were
oh no no no no no  it cannot be how embarrassing
you are a very good boy to respond that way
no no no no no
i would like to use the sanitary facilities if i may
wants to fix up her makeup no doubt
she is a real heavy sleeper sometimes
why do not you go to bedson
i cannot take my eyes off you

a hundred dollars for breakfast

some kind of animal
how do you do
how do you do mrs ryan  i would heard you were beautiful and so you are  am i intruding here
not at all
that is the matter
give us time
like hugging a lamp post
give us time haroldto adjust to your being alive
what sort of time period do you have in mind  half an hour  an hour
this reunion is not what i imagined it would be
a telegrama phone call might have helped
seemed the most honest way to begin life together againnatural unrehearsed
wellenjoy the natural honest unrehearsed resultsurgical shock
you feel that you are behaving as a woman should
that is that all about
we thought a doctor might help
your old beau
we thought it was an emergency
i do not want that chancre mechanic in here
he is a very decent man harold
we all are
should not you lie down
when i am dead  or fucking
paul said you were awfully sick
nothing would please me more
i am so glad you like each other  i was so scared so scared
awful  i cannot tell you how sorry i am
say hello to your mother
now that is what i call fun
ghastly cruel unnecessary
you will get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again  you used to eat it up
a trip you mean
he has not had breakfast yet
honeymoon  honeymoon  say it honeymoon
it is soso stark
you used to like it stark
nowturn around if you would
i am going to touch your shoulders very gently now  you must not scream  so tense so tense
i have some change
and lots of orange juiceoceans of orange juice
mrs wheeler is dead
all rightbring me a side order of mrs wheeler  oh hellsit down colonel penelope will bring you some chow
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips
which one
you are wrong
chow chow chow  god damn it nutriment
we are all going to have to go out for breakfast  the cook quit yesterday
cook by god  cook  you are the nigger now
you leave me soso without without dignity
people now have dignity when frying eggs
they do not have to feel like slaves
that is what you are supposed to say
this is not a coy deception  i do not want to be scrogged  i want love  i want tenderness
it could not
i would like to have the expert opinion of the fishalong with yours
such as
the whole concept of heroismand its sexual roots
you learned this in some college course
i learned a lot of things in college  actuallyit was norbert who told me that
and what is his most cherished possession
his most cherished possession  his violin i guess
and no one's there now
i do not think so
that is too bad  i would rather have him at hometo see what i am going to do
no you are not
why not
i came for my clothes
sneaking in the back door
i rang  it seemed like the proper door for a servile worthless organism to use
your clothes are at the city dump by now  perhaps you can get a map from the department of sanitation
i came for paul as well
if he wants to go
you took him to the funeral i hear
he would never seen a corpse  he is seen a dozen now
a dozen
it is a big and busy funeral home
he cried
about a broomstick and a cigar boxand the attenuated intestines of an alley cat
two hundred years old
he feels awful losswhich was precisely my intention
wellwhat have we here  a family
almost a christmas scene
goodbye goodbye goodbye
just one favor
money  there's plenty of that mildred got the brewery  you will probably get the baseball team
testimonials of that sort areare beyond my range  i do not do them well  that is a failing i know
see how you have upset him  he was so merry and hale before you came home
how unhappy he is going to bealone in his room
he is in east st louis with his mothervisiting an aunt
and you a supposedly healthy woman do not detest him for his cowardice
like what
he is a child
with an iron penis three feet long load it boy
you are begging him to kill you
if he thinks he is man enough
that is really what you want  you become furious when people will not make you dead
i am teaching my son to be a man
so he can kill you  you hate your own life that much  you beg for a hero to kill you
i plan to live one hundred years
no you do not
if that is the casethat is to prevent my killing myself
honor i suppose
and my son the only son of harold ryanhe is going to grow up to be a vanisher too
i do not know  i hope he never hunts  i hope he never kills another human being
i am going to call the police
i am turning off the alarm  i am turning off everything
whoever has the gun you see gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do  it is the american way
i mean it
then you would better fix your bayonet because there are not any bullets in the gun
help your mother find the bullet
how do i load
all right  am i exceedingly dangerous now
give me that goddamn thing  now get out of here or i might kill you  who knows
you have killed women
can iuhhelp you gentlemen
gentlementhat is nice
the door ws unlocked  is it always unlocked

and you come into mrs ryangs apartment as often as you please looking into various health matters
just her neighbor and doctor that is all
and her fianc
and her fianc  how nice  i hope you will be very happyor is that what one says to the woman
you wish the woman good luck and you tell the man how fortunate he is  that is how it goes
safe and sound i see  ohyou came back
how was the emergency doctor profitable i hope
a policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab
tough luck  you will have to split the fee
areare you crying penelope
i feel the same way  what next
ah  you are ambulatory
well nowwhat seems to be the trouble with the patient today  a touch of malaria perhaps
i know malaria  malaria is not caused by the bites of bats
you have chills
you can also describe its cure i am eating its cure
i was going to ask
pacqualinincheewa root
would you say that again
pacqualinincheewa root  means cougar fang cures anything but a yellow streak down the back
we have have we
that is an editorial we of course i have not turned up anything personally
i thought she was a widow
i am going to have to report you to the department of health
what for
it died for your sins
this little corpse is intended as a lesson
there's a certain amount of information there
this is man to man
it is healer to killer  is that the same thing
what brought you back
what an hallucination  oh dear dear dear dear  oh dearie me
you are a filthy rotten bastard
oooooo  that hurt
you are oldso old

hands and knees you say
you are in one hell of a jam  you realize that
i am high as a kite
glands  you are supposed to be happy when you die  call me comical again
you are a clown  you are a clown who killsbut you are a clown
i love you  have a cigar
evolution has made you a clown with a cigar  simple butchers like you are obsolete
i am to be left behindin primordial ooze
if you are at home in the ooze and nowhere else
this is going to become very physical  are you prepared for that
you are not such a creature of the ooze that you would hurt an unarmed man
i am an honorable clown
king arthur
you hope
in any event i will not beg for mercy
no quarter asked  no quarter given
do not you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew
cut me open  find out
i have struck my blow
don quixote
my violin is avenged
something seems to have happened to my selfrespect
and the hell with it  it was so tragically irrelevant so preposterously misinformed
the new hero is you
i hate crowds and i have no charisma
here  finish the job
i am utterly satisfied
you are making a mistake  obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded  you have wounded me
more clowning  do not you see
we never quit fighting until we are dead
you would be killing a friend  do not you know how much i like you
new dignity can be yoursas a merciful man  you can change
can i beg for mercyon my knees
if you want to be found that way
do not shoot

what do you want from me
you think i did not need you
i wanted to get this out of the way

it is already started
that kind with the garlic and the oil that i like so much
no the kind from kraft with the macaroni and the cheese
i have been craving that stuff all week

you talking about getting 'nekked'  shit i thought you were talking bout you know the m word
you crazy with all those people around

it is cozy girl holding on cozy girl and backtrack
stay up there girl
where is the damn wire
tell him to give me a raise
are you going to make this hard for me
depends that is up
there's been some concern about you continuing to work without backup
what if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it
is that what the guy in the sunday school suit is doing outside
great send him to the marines this guy's not a negotiator he will quit in two weeks
you let us worry about that
is there going to be an expression of your appreciation
what do you think would be in order
like ahh i do not know  five thousand dollars
and a car
hey you just got a five thousand dollar raise get a car of your own
you know you have got nothing but cars down there in impound
impound is not a rentacar company
the car is part of the deal
repoed this morning
i cannot do that
who's running it
what have you promised them
are these yours
yeah they are but
this is halden
halden how nice to hear your voice
what do you want
i have found in life that what one wants is not nearly as important as what one needs
what do you need
they have nothing to do with this 
goddamn you
yes i believe he has 
you are in there  everybody dies you go with them 
she said i have a son
how come i cannot remember
as long as it is not 'that is your signg
that is a strange question  you a strange man
there you are sitting next to the creator what do you say
your life that bad
no not me i have been lucky  but i have seen what happens to other people 
do you believe in miracles
you were right
who are you
but this is impossible
that is happening
it is time to wake up
wake up
the patterns were moved around but they were not changed
but what would happen to me  i have no body to return to
not my problem
you are not a god
god creates man man creates technology technology creates god  end into beginning
in a computer program
the new world
it is not real
you sealed off the system  when it crashes everyone dies with you
unlimited energy out there  enough to run this world for all eternity 
 but you will never be able to get it through the maze
with the energy from the net we can program this world anyway we want  redwood forests  oceans mountains 
but once the system touches the net all links are severed  everybody dies
only up there in the dream they called life
remember i am not the one who chose this
where the hell are you going
unfinished business
and what about the reconfiguration
you sure he is going to come
it is his nature
but what if he does not 
how long untill we can eject
we are going to have to reconfigure
how long
what about the customers with reservations
the maze has been changed 
where you pluggedin from
new york
the woman you are stuck on
take care
he had keys
get some internal police there tell them to run a perimeter
does not make sense  how the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys
will not be time if he gets access 
you are jumping to conclusions
try harder
christoph had spinal cancer  his body kept rejecting gene therapy he was desperate  it was him it was not us 
corporate fingerprints all over it
of course they are  christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on
the only way to eject it is from the inside
you have got the keys send someone in 
what is it
the terrace  first building christoph ever programmed for us
a hotel
christoph was in charge of designing building modules
that is right
then that is with all the staffing programs in his account
who did he digitize
listen to yourself  digitization  you know that officially that is a pure fantasy 
what did he tell you
the truth
not his style
then you had her killed
why would i do that
we drugged her  so she would not remember
try harder
there was no need to kill her
then where is she
what brings you inside
cleaning up a mess
then how do you know about 
 you told me
most nights you wake up crying never knowing why
we worked together on the inside you were on my programming team 
 the inside
identical  one's you  one's digital
that is not possible  no one can do that
but i do not know anything about programming
it was a test
i was not with you
i know
but you were with me
not you  a copy
care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program
look i am doing mute untill i have a mouthpiece here who's on my side
that is so funny
this  no point to it
why not
because you will never believe me
my uninet account  i log on  the program's there
just like that
connection approved  ready to transmit 
connect to public access
access established
select uplink for federal communications office  department of enforcement
i ai not no fucking kike

even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns

salvatore always holding himself above
we must be friends charlie

the terms will be mine
the guy doing the job names the price if you do not like it you can kill masseria yourself
i will be the boss of all bosses
tell it to the calabrian tell it to the jews
forget it that is past
why did not you tell me that maranzano had made you an offer
and if i had known i would have warned you to expect this we could have prepared
masseria's been after me too
thank you for keeping me informed
we can operate around these guys
not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants
talk english okay i did lousy at school
bring order out of chaos if you lead they will follow
and what do you want out of this
wanna know what i think
let 'em kill each other off why should we care

masseria's scared he might make our deal
so we are gonna knock 'em both off
maranzano wants you dead
everybody's talking about ya charlie first time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived
guess i am just lucky
i am coming for my twenty thousand
luciano is dead

awww deep down i am a bastard but when ya got eight kids ya cannot make enemies
take any one ya like
kinda early for christmas bugs
you are fucking crazy
but only on purpose tommy
i knew you would come i left that skylight open for you
i know you did
i knew you would know
i know you knew i would know
but did you know i knew you would know i would know
and i know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city
except for one little thing
and that is that
everything's going exactly as we planned
not quite you have not announced our engagement yet
it must have slipped my mind
where are you going
what are you doing all alone in the dark
i thought you were done
our guests are waiting
you two timing psychotic bastard
darling you have got the wrong idea
the bowler i remember him from when i was a kid he was killed years ago
so who killed him
we did not think this through very well
he was the last time i saw him
when was that
much less go outside
we could really use some coffee 
come on baby
atta girl
hey do i look like a man
who are you
and you cannot count horst buckholtz anyway
he was cute though
how about the savage six
but she is your mother you gotta tell her
i am her only son and she always had such high hopes for me medicine law
but you are a superhero
the cape the turban she would not understand
i know my girlfriends all dumped me after i put on the mask they thought i would lost it
it is late i am heading home
me too
no one will believe us
sounds good to me
but that place is huge and we do not know where this psycho thing is 
hey can i buy you a beer
that is two more than the fantastic four
what did he mean
eat your mustard
it is me elizabeth
how is your dad
he is dead
doc these are my friends we are superheroes and we need your help
snap out of it
he will never make it
i got it
should i kill them
that boy's got talent
what did you do with captain amazing
you are nuts
they always call the great ones nuts
and the nuts always call themselves great
thanks for reminding me which team i am on
you are dead
let me guess bullets do not hurt you
are you an actress
just a waitress
i would love to hear you read it could you stick around after the luncheon
i thought you would chickened out on me
how about giving me the tour
come here
i am not that kind of girl
i would better go
stay away
i guess are you always so angry
or talk
alone tonight
being a superhero wanting to save the world it is so unselfish
it is
most people just want to make money or be famous or something but you risk everything just to help people
i would not mind being famous
nothing wrong with being a waitress
me too i love this stupid old town it is noisy it is smelly it is falling apart
i have thought of leaving going to chicago or new york but
what have they got that we ai not got
championgs going to bounce back and i want to be here when it does
me too
you know what underneath all that anger i think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him
i just want to be a superhero
it is me
at the frankenstein center
are you nuts get out of there
i am going inside
and what if you get killed
so how do you know that you have ever been invisible
come on guys  we are fighting against evil
you are the sphinx
the wise snake coils before he strikes
you drink too much
when are you going to take off that mask
your rage is a very great power but it blinds you to your heart
my heart died a long time ago
leave him alone she is his mother not yours
we had an off night that is all
what are you talking about
and it would be the right thing to do
i am liking this
have you ever seen him
how could i see him if he is invisible
there's just not enough of us
there's a big difference
you know something those guys are really starting to piss me off
but there's still only six of us
so what else has superman got
this place is built like a fortress
get mad
your spiderman pez dispenser 
but she still might call
are you coming or not
i will drive
cover me
he does not miss a trick does he
he is lance hunt just take off the glasses  and it is him
there's a vague similarity
we need a break that is all nobody would ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein
why do they always fill stuff these things so full you cannot pull 'em out without ripping 'em 
i lost another fork tonight she is getting suspicious i know it
so why do not you just tell her
i cannot
why not
so you are chicken
maybe you should try a more romantic approach
like what cutting off my own ear
or flowers
i saw him go in  and he did not come out
let's go
maybe she is right
maybe there was traffic
roy remember it is all within your power the only thing that is in your way is you
so where is the art
that is that
he is turned into a completely normal person
the obliterators
firepower costs money
yes obiewan
you guys going to a costume party
we are superheroes
are you famous
not yet
so you are like struggling superheroes
usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill in his case it is entirely emotional
so what can i get you
oh hi mom
what are you doing in the silver drawer
it is on the television
jeffrey you thief
mother it is not what you think
and why are you wearing that silly costume
but the silverware
i use it to fight evil
jeffrey this is wonderful
it is
i always knew that you were special
you did
we take the licks and he gets the chicks
this is bad
who are they
we may be getting in over our heads here
this looks like a job for superman 
or batman 
be a mohican
do we have to
and there's the sphinx
the who
and a social life
to us
are you sure he is still lives here
but doc where is the machine guns
he busted casanova and sent the crooks packing
maybe it is time we checked that place out
that was too close
we are outnumbered twenty to one
oh no

here's my passport please give me a visa i have to leave for russia immediately
count leon d'algout a count a nobleman
do not hold that against me please

are you sympathetic to the former czaristic government  the white russians
on the contrary  i do not want to have anything to do with them
she must have her little joke  you are not going to take that seriously
the grand duchess swana active in the white russian movement
believe me i have no connection with her any longer i swear i have not
but you had
listen i want to be absolutely frank with you i have no business in moscow

that is impossible nobody has the right you cannot do that if you do not give me that visa
why should i take a chance
on what
how do i know you do not want to blow up a factory

how long do we have to wait here
well  until the policeman whistles again
how many minutes between the first and second whistle
that is funny it is interesting i never gave it a thought before
thank you

you might hold this for me
love to
correct me if i am wrong we are facing north are not we
facing north i would hate to commit myself without my compass pardon me are you an explorer
no i am looking for the eiffel tower
is that thing lost again listen if you are interested in a view
why do you need my finger
bad manners to point with your own here the eiffel tower
and where are we
here here we are here you are and here i am feel it
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points must you flirt
i do not have to but i find it natural
suppress it
for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale
madame it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is
you are very sure of yourself are not you
a russian i love russians comrade i have been fascinated by your five year plan for the past fifteen years
the foundation is one hundred and fortyone yards square  i hope you will forgive me but i thought you would
that is a strange angle
you gave me some very valuable information thank you
and thank you for getting me up here i have never seen this before beautiful is not it
yes it is
does that mean that you want me to go there
please do not misunderstand me
then you do not want me to go there
now i did not say that either naturally nothing would please me more
then why do not we go  you might be an interesting subject of study
good evening comrade  this man is horribly old you should not make him work
he takes good care of that
he looks sad do you whip him
no though the mere thought makes my mouth water
well may i offer you a drink or how about something to eat
and what is your profession
keeping my body fit keeping my mind alert keeping my landlord appeased that is a fulltime job
and what do you do for mankind
for mankind not a thing  for womankind the record is not quite so bleak
you are something we do not have in russia
thank you thank you
that is correct
ninotchka do you like me just a little bit
your general appearance is not distasteful
thank you
oh i see what do you use instead
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you
you do not have to do a thing chemically we are already quite sympathetic
you are the most improbable creature i have ever met in my life ninotchka ninotchka
you repeat yourself
i would like to say it a thousand times
the bayonet did you really
i was wounded before warsaw
wounded how
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade would you like to see my wound
i would love to  tsk tsk tsk
a polish lancer i was sixteen
poor ninotchka poor poor ninotchka

do you hear that
i cannot possibly think of a better reason
was that talkative
thank you
glorious analytical
the telephone is ringing
oh let it ring
i must go
ninotchka or shall i say special envoy yakushova
as a representative of moscow
tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves
it is out of the question if you wish to approach me
you know i want to
but ninotchka i held you in my arms you kissed me
i do not like your following me
i did not follow you
then how did you get here
i always eat here
just an old man his memory is getting weak
what are you after
must one always be after something
just smile
because we are an odd couple
then you should go back to your table
on which boat
well er let's drop it i do not think you would care for that one
probably not
do you like scotch stories
i do not think so
you see life can be so simple
for twelve francs seventyfive
it is nine o'clock
that is when one half of paris says to the other half what are your plans for this evening madame
well first i should like to take off my hat and jacket  then could we have some music
a wonderful idea radio or records
leon i would like to ask you something
anything ninotchka
if you do not want to answer you need not but if you do you must tell me the truth
i promise i swear
did you make any change in this room
ninotchka i love you
i suppose she is very entertaining it must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous
how do you do
quickly please tell me one of your funny stories
a funny story
you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names
wonderful  if one could believe it
you must darling

i am sorry i do not want to overstep my position  but please do not send me
please do not waste my time comrade do your duty goodby
this way madame are you alone by the window perhaps  or a nice little corner table
raw carrots and beets

but madame if you do not think about food what do you think about
the future of the common people
where to madame
can you recommend a restaurant
well there's pruniers if you care for seafood if you want to lunch in the bois there's
where do you eat
at pre mathieu's
where is that
it is just a place for workmen
where is it
your highness
how do you do my friend
your highness forgive this intrusion but
what is it rakonin did you lose your job
no madame something of the utmost importance it concerns your jewels
why do you bring this up after so many years
they are here your jewels here in paris
i am sorry i have to leave
how long do you leave him in there
wheelchair accessible
not anymore mr o'brien  the nanobot has changed that
if you think i would ever give you the nanobot after this you are deluding yourself
you cannot mean that
something to drink dr bright
no thank you
we will always love most that which we create  do not you agree susan
what are you going to do to him
what did you use
poison  i am surprised at you  you lack vision mr o'brien
i should kill you right now for what you did to me
how apropos
i know what you are doing
you mean besides kicking your ass
please o'brien do not do this to me  i will give you anything you want
you cannot do this  you owe me o'brien  i made you plastic  i made you
like rotting meat
oh no  smell this
icarus please if you want me to give you a bath just say so
she is working as fast as she can icarus  it will be ready soon
it is ready now i know it is
she says it is not
she is lying  she lost the first one on purpose
she did not  the mouse ran down the drain
icky  that is happening
it works poppy  it works it works
now icky i do not need you winding yourself up  i need you focused and in control
a containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention
gently ott  gently
do you think she will give us the designs
eventually  these things are always a matter of leverage
and you think o'brien is that leverage
and you still believe he is going to come here
based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable
do you think she loves him
poppy are you in one of your moods again
why are there two ottomans
yes  yes of course it is
then you still love me
can you feel it poppy  the presence of the moment  can you feel the weight of its significance
oh yes icky  i can feel it
this is what my entire life has been directed at this moment this threshold
it will be an ascension
i was wondering if you would finished considering
considering what
poppy please 
if you loved me like i loved you
did you feel that
did i  i have been waiting for that for years
facts dr nebbleman  facts you have been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment have not you
well yes  the replicators are not as active at low temperatures
then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control
that might work
she could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys
where did he go
they are here  they are here  we have the nanobot
dr makeo is working on it now sir i estimate at least another six hours
of course you understand dr argon that once the nanobot is inside of you there is no going back 
excellent work dr nebbleman  you have outdone yourself
it will be better for us if he simply disappears  the gardener will know what to do
wait wait can i at least have his body
you do not want this
yeah i do
you have no idea what this is doing to your body
here kid this is great stuff  why do not you give it a try
yeah  so what
so what  so what  for starters how about littering is a crime
what is it with you litterbugs  is it a territorial thing marking your turf with your garbage
what are you going to do  make me throw it out
this morning  i saw someone i have not seen in a long time
a man
yeah  i knew him when i was still in school
do you remember about five years ago that uh incident at purnell labs
oh yeah  they were working on molecular assemblers too were not they
they also tried using viral rna as the bonding element
yeah  but it was not a group  it was one man
what did security say
they will in validate the key probably nothing
well you got another problem
the replicators
worse  mrs argon wants to talk to you  she is waiting in the lab
you were never invited to my house
i do not believe this is happening
there's a guard outside my door i am a prisoner nigel  do you understand that
is that what argon told you
no  well not those exact words
nigel cannot you see he is using you
of course he is but at least there is not a security guard outside my door
you are afraid of him
it is sim  we are almost there
that is it smell like
smell  uh something like methylcyanoacrylate
like crazy glue
sir please try to hold still
he is probably right sir the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight
when did you
been out for six months now
really  what have you been doing
somebody has to
the big house
the big house
jesus daniel  it was not ryker's island  it was work camp for white collar criminals
i guess i should be flattered
i remember you said nanotechnology was going to change the world
it already is
i have read they are using it to repair cancer cells
and for cleaning up oil spills
do you ever wonder what happened to us susie
well it was good to see you daniel but i have to be going
nothing really worthwhile
yeah we will see
we will see  what does that mean
we will see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making agent orange
you are insane
daniel give him the trix
susie  you gotta help me
daniel what are you doing here
please susan  i need help something is wrong with me
sorry daniel i am a physicist not a psychiatrist
they did it to me
 just like the mouse
mouse  what mouse
my first organicpolymerization was a lab mouse
what happened to it
you do not know
it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment
we do not have time for hysterics
what are these
pills you know how i feel about pills
why do we need it
the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste
got it
the problem is the byproduct created by the process
the replicators start off like assemblers but the replicators never stabilize
that was an egg
three days ago it was
what do these replicators do to people
so right now there's little replicators spreading throughout argongs lab
that is right
i think while we are waiting we had better run some basic diagnostics on you
lungs sound fine  you did not have any preexisting physical conditions did you  allergies infections
is something wrong
look at this
just look at it
that is that supposed to mean
just giving credit where credit is due
you have no one to blame but yourself
this is what i deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists
you are not protecting the world you are obstructing progress
i do not consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress
and i am sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world
but lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate
come on i do not see you living in a cave
just like old times
i want you to know that i really appreciate you helping me
i feel very emotional right now  a bit out of control
probably the caffeine
do you have something to bring me down
uh oh  i remember that temper
that is wrong
the nanobot it is not here
how far can you stretch
what did you want my hair for
no cheese
that is pretty good
that is going to fit me
did you go
who is he
i do not believe it  you are here oh thank god
oh no  argon  we have to stop him before he uses the nanobot  we have to get the nanobot
where is it
argongs private lab
run daniel  get out of here
you saved my life
what in the
oh shit the meltdown  it is spread to the tower
we have got to get the nanobot
it is too late  argon injected it
what would happen if i threw him into the core
daniel just forget argon  let's get out of here  we will find another way to stop the waste
you are not going after argon
i have to
i remember i was trying to help
god what a fight that was
things do change
you  i remember you
what  i am not going anywhere
only this ai not no tranquilizer gun now let's go
this is wonderfully accommodating of you all  now i will not have to come looking for you
you were looking for us
yeah i have something i have been meaning to give you
yeah and what might that be
all the different ways that i could kill you
maybe you are ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof
that is impossible
mrs argon  it is sim
mr sim  do you have him  he is alive
oh yeah he is alive  technically
and you have him
i spoke to dr argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot
i am aware of dr argongs frustrations
is that a threat dr bright
i could have you fired right now
okay barbie let's get this over with
it might be paranoia but i have never lost my keycard before
what in the hell
i put blueberries in them just the way you like

you think you could do this like soon it is almost six thirty
gosh i loved that show watched it for years
that is not the reason i have got a date at six thirty
umhello i have got like a social emergency here
told you it was your lucky day bet you thought i was just a fan or something
what happened
dream come true hunh
this is not funny i happen to have a very important date in like five minutes
oh god 
saw you at the mall yesterday
welcome to charenton abbe du maupas
 and the listless ones do the binding
it is remarkable doctor the patients are so subdued so docile
of course everything's not as harmonious as it seems i hope you have a strong constitution
my years tending the lepers at st emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings doctor
we ought not be reading his nasty stories 
you have been to his quarters have not you
once or twice
i hear he is got a whetstone and chisel and he uses them to sharpen his teeth
he is a writer not a madman
if you are going to slander him then you do not deserve to hear his stories 
marquis is that you
for fuck's sake who else would it be the witching hour's arrived you have alerted the others yes
at your service count
with that fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue 
to seal the wound he took a poker from the fire 
then how can we know who is truly good and who is evil
yes abbe
has he hurt you
i was wrong to free him but so are you  for taking all his treasures  his quills and his ink 
had i known your taste in novels i never would have taught you to read
do not say that reading's my salvation
but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence
i put myself in his stories i play the parts each strumpet each murderess
in part yes
charenton has changed it is not safe for you here
do not turn us out abbe
it is a sin against god for me to refuse your kindness but my heart's held fast here
by whom the marquis
madeleine i there are certain things feelings we must not voice
why not
go back to your room quickly
what what have i done
do not come back not tonight not again 
if you would grant me a final favor i would like the chance to explain myself 
free his mouth
must not do that sir
i must grant him his last rites
i do not take my orders from you not anymore
care for a splash of wine abbe
it is not even noon 
i am entertaining you now are not i
i am not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption
yes it is the paper's cheap the type's too small 
what did you do bribe one of the guards
but you implored me to write for curative purposes to stave off my madness 
but you have no right to publish behind my back without my sanction
have you truly read the book in question or did you run  straightaway  to the dogeared pages
there i was taxed it is true
it is a fiction not a moral treatise
but is not that the duty of art to elevate us above the beast
i thought that was your duty abbe not mine
one more trick like this and i will be forced to revoke all your liberties
it is that doctor fellow is not it he is come to usurp your place here has not he
more than your writing's at stake the ministry has threatened us with closure
they cannot be serious
our future lies in the stroke of your pen
fuck 'em they are halfwits and pinheads let 'em die on the streets as nature intended
you have a touch of the poet too perhaps you should take up the quill
you mean to take us all down with you
he cannot do that to me
how can one man possibly be so selfish
what the devil 
i will die of loneliness i have no company but the characters i create 
i have a proposition
you always do
madeleine she is besotted with me she would do anything i ask she could pay you a midnight visit 
i do not know who you insult more her or me
part the gates of heaven as it were 
that is enough
you are tense darling you could use a long slow screw
good day marquis
my bed gone am i to freeze to death
his rug
that is a turkish weave you numbskull it costs more than you will earn in your lifetime 
virgin birth  ha an entire religion built on an oxymoron
why this sudden torture
i did not create this world of ours i only record it
if it were up to the doctor you would be flayed alive
a man after my own heart
what in god's name am i to do with you the more i forbid the more you are provoked
i could be convinced to abandon my writing quite voluntarily
what on earth would that require
a night spent with the partner of my choice
you expect me to pimp madeleine
off with your clothes
coulmier you animal
i do not mean to flirt marquis
oh but you must my pumpkin sex without flirtation is merely rape
it is a potent aphrodisiac is not it power over another man
oh i am to be blamed now am i
an innocent child is dead
it is no secret that you loved her
oh that is rich  coming from her lapdog 
i saw the longing in your eye 
 that was lust 
do not confuse one organ with another 
i know because i felt it myself 
i wanted to fuck her that is all
and did you
it is not your province to ask
you are no stranger to rape marquis and yet with her you cooed you courted you begged
go to hell
why was it you never took her by force
who's to say i did not
i fucked her countless times in every orifice and all the while she plead for more 
i dare you stab my flesh which one of us will bleed
abbe de coulmier
i am here
surely you will grant me a final word
of course
i will need an office on the grounds someplace to store my things
if you do not mind my asking why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my our affairs
i understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction
why is he in your care and not a proper prison
his wife's influence
his wife's
and he is never once attempted escape
what is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche
he no longer roars or spits he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards 
it is essential to his recovery a purgative for the toxins in his mind
do you favor its publication
you have to believe me i had no idea 
all france is aghast at this book yet you have not heard of it
shut down
in their eyes the marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here
but he is one among some two hundred wards 
have you tried bleeding him with leeches the calming chair maybe you should flog him at the stake
why so he will learn to fear punishment rather than pursue virtue for its own reward
on the contrary let me take up this matter with the marquis myself 
and place my reputation at stake
he is more than a patient doctor the marquis is my friend 
you keep strange company abbe but if you truly have matters in hand here 
i have
madame bougival mademoiselle clairwil  and of course  the marquis' wife 
it was fiction of course
of course
it was not inspired by circumstance
you ought to be ashamed abbe exploiting those drooling pathetic cretins for financial gain 
i will do everything in my power 
you will get more from her with kindness than you will with force
he will do no such thing
it is a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children 
this child let loose the beast from its cage 
if only blood will appease you then shed mine
as you say doctor
perhaps you will be so kind as to remind me of her name
i beg you doctor do not make me say it
my my you have exceeded my expectations
and my own
will you sleep soundly tonight
but i am history
charenton the administrator there is quite wellloved is he not
i am afraid so he is an idealist you will have to be politic
i will pass the word on then
i will pay you another visit with a share of the profits once its sold
i will be waiting
you asked my name once it is madeleine
quickly my suckling out of your clothes my scepter awaits how solid it grows
my darling eugenie dainty morsel get on your back let's try it dorsal
i will plunder every lovely pore until you are week and cry no more
i tremble with fear you are bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound
and then  to prove your truly mine  i will plunder you darling from behind
what of my lips will you soil them too when you have broken every other taboo
it is not your cup of tea mama
a habitu of cemeteries his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior deceased a dozen years
i am only a laundress not a detective
you are more than a priest you are an angel ai not he maddy
i am hungry for a proper visit
do not start 
it is the only frontier i have left plumcake
the peril of composing such incendiary prose
if only these coins purchased your other talents too
there's something else i want from you
you have already stolen my heart as well as another more prominent organ south of the equator
your publisher says i am not to leave without a new manuscript
the unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass the darling of the lower wards where they entomb the criminally insane
is it awfully violent
most assuredly
is it terribly erotic
a kiss for each page
must i administer them directly or might i blow them
the price my coquette is every bit as firm as i am
it is a long story this one
the climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap
the story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium
they have taken your clothes
surely you have seen a man naked
i must say in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations
he is a man of god he is true to his vows
it need not be not if you have another story
how do you propose i write it with dust upon the air
yes that is it a final volley from us both
yes you shall of course you shall 
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined
yes i have got that bit
your wife
tell him i am no fool a prisongs still a prison even with chinese silk and chandeliers
you would do that rather than forsake our love
it is customary to write first and request an appointment 
desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy
i beg to differ doctor you work in a madhouse your every waking moment is governed by the insane
i pray you be succinct
you are aware are you not that it costs a great deal to house your husband at charenton
perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them
i am not a wealthy woman
but you have a pension have not you from the sale of his books
it is tainted money doctor
what a beautiful thought marquise
what thought is that
if you are truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity 
oh but i am
 words alone are insufficient
do not toy with me doctor
i am eternally in your debt
and i in yours
doctor can i impart to you his cruelest trick
of course
public scorn carries a terrible sting trust me i am a woman who knows
hm tell me what other treats
how was i to know my darling
i beg you donatien as your wife your only ally you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself
you have come to lecture me
to flaunt your deviance in public upon a stage
they have put you up to this have not they
it is the way of all martyrs is not it
leave at once 
but it is just begun 
does not that please you
very much
i would prefer to have our brandy in the salon there we can sit sideby side before the fire
i would rather read thankyou
ever met walter winchell
no when i was but a tender lad
so you ever gonna do a picture
not you too
it is gonna be fine orson you are gonna do great
i wonder sometimes
you are just scared
we have known each other too long orson sling the bullshit elsewhere
carole you wound me as if i could hope to pacify you with evasions of
that poor woman
god these parties are the worst
you need to get outta here rapunzel
that is why he has the parties he says it is like bringing the world to me
why do not you come down to la stay with us for a while
it is not so bad here after all what girl does not want to live in a castle
mr welles certainly is a caution
yeah orsongs a real piece of work but deep down he is a good kid real deep down
listen you come down and stay with us for a few days just tell the old man that
i cannot

the character that is supposed to be me susan alexander
marion everyone knows you are not like that
who are you sir
my name is orson welles
the actor
and director
i see and you are in california for what reason
well i wish you luck it is a treacherous business
so i have been told
in hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed
i wonder do you have any idea what you have done
quite and this is why i came to visit have you heard about this citizen kane picture
and maybe we could get mr warner and mr goldwyn and mr cohn and mr selznick to play as well
you know that cannot happen
oh why is that
why is that louis
goddamn it i gotta have some kinda life
there's no call for that language
there that is right
she is a catholic she says it would put her soul in peril divorce is a very serious sin apparently
the journal was pretty harsh to roosevelt today
how bad is it
the sec has turned down my request for relief on the debts
how much
it is not really
how does one get 125 million dollars in debt
well  he got us did not he she stands and goes quickly to pour a drink a forced laugh
bought and pppaid for just like one of his goddamn statues well at least in the movie he married her
this picture
then you explain it to me
there's nothing to explain
a million dollars a year on art and stststatues and there's nothing to explain
i will not defend my life to you
i am not asking you to defend anything but we are in a pickle and we gotta talk about it
we are in no pickle  as you would euphemistically have it
you gotta wake up now pops
you are being typically theatrical marion i need the tribune to
that  did you need that how much did that cost
it is 12th century from deauville  in france
i know where deauville is for ccchrist's sake
you need not use that language with me
did you need it did you need any of it
i wanted it
there's a different between want and
that is right you have captured me exactly goodnight
you will not walk out on me
you are repellant when you drink
tough shit we need to tttalk about this
fuck you mr kane
i will not have this in my home
castle  still fighting old battles he will never win with pulitzer and roosevelt and hollywood
i do not want you to
thank you for your time
sir i
he lied to me
he looked into my face and told me it was not about you
i want blood
keep filming
i cannot remember the lines
you are not going to get another chance boy look right at the monster and you tell him
you do not care about anything except you you just want to persuade people that you
love them so much that they ought to love you back only you want love on your own terms 
we are using
you are not doing hearst are you
good god no the character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons
that is right a symphony of those vaunted and valued tellersoftruth those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties
orson hold on look into my eyes tell me you are not doing hearst
schaefer i gotta see this welles picture
louella hello i was just fixing a drink would you like
you drink at 10 am do you
no  no  i mean
cut the malarkey buddy the boss himself wants me to see the picture today
he personally asked you to
louella please be reasonable i understand you have problems with orsongs picture but maybe we can work something out
nix sweetie you shelve it
can i talk to hearst
i do not know what you expected with joseph fuckingconrad for chrissake i mean this is hollywood pal
what are movies about orson
forget it
what are movies about
not for me
then you better get ready to be the youngest never was in hollywood history
that is better than being the oldest hasbeen in hollywood history
we find the man and then we dissect him
like a bug
but with compassion and insight
how about howard hughes we could do hughes
i am not fucking with hughes that shitkicker would kill us dead baby just like jean harlow
howard hughes killed jean harlow
who the hell's manolete
the great spanish bullfighter
the man does not allow drinking or cigars this is monstrous
look at those hands those are the hands of an artist a modern caravaggio
in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree   how big is it all told the estate
mank you scoundrel what took you so long
here you are up with the birds for once you vampire
okay boy wonder what
oh christ
image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his
howard hughes he would just kill us hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved
so speaks the court jester
fuck you
i expected more from you
do not do this
where did he go he has not had a screen credit in four years
let me out
listen to me
fuck you
i am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again
he will destroy us
so who is he we have to know him
this girl on a dock white dress never said a word to her
why her
all men love but men like hearst  they do not bother with convention because
they do not have to
hearst looks down at the world at his feet everything has always been beneath him
it is 350 pages long
yeah but the margins are real wide
short enough but this is a grand start and i think we need to change the name
cain  like the bible guy
kane one strong syllable kane i
craig is one syllable
i um i do not know if i should i ai not been drinking since i started on this
jesus christ 
uh huh
i want you back
fuck you  you wanted me out i am out
i am sorry
did i ever tell you about my father
i do not give a shit about
hey kid gregg
mank sit down you missed the opening of the new picture but i will go back
hedy lamarr
what does this have to do with
believe you me they are gonna do anything  and i mean absolutely anything  to stop that word from getting out
if he had known about kane before you made it you would be dead already
it is too late the movie's made
they will not let it out not hearst not the other studio heads
you gonna watch
what have i done
he truly does not care if he ever works again
they came to me with an offer 800000 for the negative and all the prints
and they went to the stockholders in new york
thank you
not one of them today has what you had miss davies not one of them
thank you  bbbut i would really like ttto
of course of course how can we be of service
as i said i have some jjjj  that i might wish ttto sell and i wanted an estimate
very generous
and we gotta be clear here i need the negative and every existing print
to do what
that is for me to decide
you are going to destroy it
no maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it
you are lying to me
get out
you are betting on an inside straight this time you will never pull it off
please do not ask me to do this
for the title
this is an abomination there's no music and
they have all seen a rough cut
the magazines are one thing  but hedda why did we have to let her come
and this is the evening edition notice anything
then find another theater
do what you can that is not good enough i
well it' s all you have got 
you are with them are not you you are going to bury my movie they bought you
for christ's sake shut up
that soulless monster gets no tears from me
you are not still mad at me i hope
no we are jake but listen
look not a single scene shot in the studio we have found natural locations for the whole story
hold on a sec i got news we finally found somewhere to premiere kane but
i told you where graumangs el capitan or did radio city come crawling back
i think you better sit down
it is my birthday this week i will be 26
oh god  
it was fun was not it
it was the best kid
so on to the life of christ
orson you wanna take five
spare me the aria i know what you want
i need my shoes in total focus right here and also joe back there
i know what you want but it cannot be done
take apart the fucking camera rig  we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up
how about a real drink
he is christ
i am christ
that was quick
false alarm
we do not usually let people smoke in the house we have a patio if you 
oh uhhuh
are you uncomfortable with my appearance
no i think you look fine
oh i like it i like it very much
freelance you know
yes so you feel security stability like things are going to last awhile
oh uhhuh
anyway i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned
how long has it been since you have seen john
nine years
nine years
yes i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place
why did not you know him well
that is hard to believe the two of you seem so different
this food is excellent
mother father sister
i do not know
maybe you will understand this because you know john but he confuses me sometimes
i feel like they do
so what about kids
kids what about them
do you want them
yeah actually i do but john does not at least not right now
why is that
so that is your personal thing are you really going to tell me something personal
my therapist said that 
you are in therapy
well my therapist knows me intimately
you had sex with you therapist
of course not
oh see i meant someone you have had sex with that is part of the theory
excuse me for asking but how would you know
now you said never take advice from someone that you do not know intimately right
so since i have never had sex with you by your own advice i should not accept your advice
ann hello
are you in the middle of something
nothing i cannot finish later
i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished
it is a personal project i am working on
what kind of personal project
oh just a personal project like anyone else's personal project mine's just a little more personal
donna on this tape it says donna
donna was a girl i knew in florida
you went out with her
because i enjoy interviewing women more than men
why not
what what are these interviews about
the interviews are about sex ann
what about sex
everything about sex
and they just answer them
mostly sometimes they do things
to you
no not to me for me for the camera
i do not why why do you do this
i am sorry this came up
this is just so
maybe you want to go
john and cynthia have been fucking
i know
how did you know
she said it on her tape
why did not you tell me
but even if we had been speaking i would not have told you
do you think that is such a good idea
do not you want to make one
yes but i sense the element of revenge here
what would you know about a normal frame of mind
that is a good question
what do you have to do to get ready
load a new tape turn the camera on
how do you pay for all this i mean rent and tapes and this equipment
i have money
what will you do when the money runs out
tell me your name
tell me your name
ann bishop millaney
do you talk to him
sometimes afterward
you do not know what i am thinking
is he going to see this
yes i have i will
then as far as this taping goes you have nothing to worry about
i guess not
you are not like your sister you could not be like her if you wanted to
about who
i fantasized about you
have you fantasized about me
i thought i made that clear before when i said i would go down on you
why not
if i cannot do it all i do not want to do anything and i cannot do it all
you said you were not always impotent
that is correct
who was the last person you had sex with
her name was elizabeth
so what happened was it so bad that it turned you off
no it was wonderful that was not the problem
so you lied to her
yes i did willfully and repeatedly
and now you can
now i make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me
i do not know anymore i thought i was but obviously i was wrong
did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him
not yet i am not sure i will i just want out
interesting analogy
i am babbling
no you are not
god i m so mad at him
you are really never going to make love again
if you were in love with me would you
i am not in love with you
but if you were
i i cannot answer that precisely
but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you
that is very flattering
so why will not you make love with me why would not you i mean
ann are you asking me hypothetically or are you asking me for real right now
i cannot
why not
i have told you
but i do not understand 
ann it could happen to me all over again do not you see i could start to 
but how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig 
but you are planning to be
not entirely
graham i mean what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her
as i said i have not decided what to do exactly perhaps i will not do anything
do not do that
i cannot tell you like this
i am just going to keep asking until you answer i am sure there's plenty of tape
i do not find this turning the tables thing very interesting 
you are not answering me
well what kind of answer are you looking for ann what is it exactly that you want to know
tuesday i had a late lunch
yes i just got busy
then maybe i saw an old message there are a lot of them on my desk you know
who would you have lunch with
something wrong
are you having an affair
jesus christ where would that come from i have a late lunch by myself and now i am fucking somebody
well are you
there's nothing to know ann
my sister for one is that who it is
for god's sake ann i am not fucking your sister i do not find her that attractive for one
but i am not
i am not either
yeah jeez give me some credit
i did not say it was rational i just said i was convinced
is not therapy helping at all
i do not know sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world
quitting your therapy will not feed the children of ethiopia
where did you go when you left here
goddammit goddammit that son of a bitch  well at least i know you did not fuck him
you son of a bitch
i have thought about it yes
ann do you see a pattern here
but he asked you to quit your job and you do have housework
yeah i know
this unexpected visit notwithstanding how are things with john
what do you mean
did you masturbate
god no
so it was recently that you tried this
no i have not
well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you  i knew i should not have watered those plants
did you confront john about the visitor
what visitor
is he still at your house
no he left last week
did you find him attractive
what do you mean like physically
i guess
do you want to leave therapy
not really
i am glad you feel that way because i feel that way too
there are many things that can exert control over one's life good and bad religion greed philanthropy drugs
i just want to know what he looks like is all
why so you can go after him
besides even if i decided to fuck his brains out what business is that of yours
you know what you say it just to irritate me
ann you always underestimate me
oh for god's sake really cynthia really i do not think he is your type
my type what is this bullshit how would you know what my type is
he does not have a phone
well i will call him when he does
but he will not
what are you talking about
he is not getting a phone he does not like talking on the phone
oh please okay so give me the zen master's address i will think of a reason to stop by
let me talk to him first
why just give me the address you will not even have to be involved
i do not feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and
and what
lose something
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune
are you getting mom something for her birthday
i do not know i will get her a card or something
a card for her fiftieth birthday
will you stop jesus
i just thought it might 
good now if you will pardon me i have to go to work
i do not he does not want you to come over
what do you mean he does not want me to come over did you tell him about me
no i did not
why not
because i never got around to it
well why
because cynthia look john was right graham is strange very strange you do not want to get involved with him
then that is the story that is this strange bullshit all of a sudden is he drowning puppies or what
no it is nothing like that
well what is he dangerous
no he is not dangerous not physically
well what then
i do not want to talk about it
then why would you call me
he just asked me questions
what kinds of questions
questions about sex
why did you do that
because i wanted to
but why did you want to
he would not do that
you do not know that for sure
well it is too late now is not it
did he touch you
no but i did
in front of him ann yes
you are in trouble
listen to you you sound like mom what are you talking about
i mean i could not do that in front of john even
you could not do it period
you know what i mean you do not even know him
i feel like i do
that does not mean you do you cannot possibly trust him he is perverted
he is harmless he just sits around and looks at these tapes that is the big deal
so he is got this catalogue of women touching themselves that does not make you feel weird
no i do not think they all did what i did
i do not want to discuss it
here it is
what is it
it is a sun dress
it looks like a tablecloth
i was just trying to 
so that is my share of the dress
thank you
did he ask me to take my clothes off no he did not
no i touched me
i wish you would get an answering machine
there's a phone here
well why would she want a sun dress she is got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins
who are you
i am cynthia bishop
do i know you
i am ann millaney's sister
the extrovert
she must have been in a good mood when she said that she usually calls me loud
she called you that too may i ask why you are here
you want me to leave
i just want to know why you are here
she still is
how did you find me
oh okay i think i get it
not exactly
well either you are or you are not which is it
why do not you let me tape you
about what
sex your sexual history your sexual preferences
you just want to ask me questions
i just want to ask you questions
and that is all
that is all
would anybody else see the tape
absolutely not they are for my private use only
how do we start
i turn on the camera you start talking
how long will it take
that depends on you one woman only used three minutes another filled up three two hour tapes
do i sit or stand
whichever you prefer
i would rather sit are you ready
i am now recording tell me your name
cynthia patrice bishop
describe for me your first sexual experience
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse
how unfortunate so when did you finally get to see a penis
when i was fourteen
live or in a photograph or film of some sort
very much live
were you disappointed
what did he say
he said that my hand felt good
then what happened
would you like me to take my pants off
if you wish  you are not wearing any underwear
john does not have sex with ann anymore
is that what he tells you
no not even one more
i never do more than one i am sorry
i cannot talk you into it
no you will have to get somebody else
now who the hell is going to do that for me
i would
well what the hell am i supposed to do
cynthia i do not know
i cannot believe you are doing this after i let you tape me
i am sorry i cannot do it
i have got to get back to the office
who said i was jealous
i wish i could tell everybody that anngs a lousy lay beautiful popular ann bishop millaney
could be risky
well maybe i could just start a rumor then
no i mean doing it at my house
i am intrigued
cynthia john meet me at my house in exactly one hour
cynthia john
not today i have got other plans
oh  well when then
how about inviting me over to dinner
you know what i mean
john millaney
cynthia john
well this is timely your wife is here would you like to speak to her
i do not know i am not sure i can duplicate the level of intensity i had the other day
nothing wrong with trying
do you want me to stop calling
it is just so blatantly stupid i have a hard time believing you did it
that is so stupid about it
that you you do not even know the guy
i like the way he dresses
does not work he has to know the people he has to be able to interact with them
i felt like it so what goddam you and ann make such a big deal out of it
you told ann about this
of course she is my sister i tell her almost everything
i wish you had not done that
why not
it is just something i would prefer she did not know about
she is a grownup she can handle it
i just ann is very
you realize you have no recourse legally this stuff could show up anywhere
it will not i trust him
you trust him
yeah i do a helluva lot more than i trust you
what do you mean
exactly what i said i would trust him before i would trust you how much clearer can i be
look are we going to do it or not
actually no i have changed my mind i should not have called
well i am here now i would like to do something
if he had been under your prick you would have spotted him for sure
god you you are mean
i know will you please leave now
maybe i do not want to leave maybe i want to talk
john we have nothing to talk about
i knew it i knew it things are getting complicated
plenty of room for two people

what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit you are wearing
i am sorry am i prying again

yes this afternoon i was grilling ann about your marriage this afternoon
really how would it go
i wish i did not have to live someplace
get rid of the car when you get your apartment then you will still have one key

infantile regression
you got it

we have been hearing some bad things about you brad
i know i know it is just
do you watch  wouldentonvale' janet
i know he is boring but neurospecialists  that sounds pretty drastic
is it because i am becoming too popular
when do i get to see brad
dear old bert's settled everything
how did you come by this scenario
i am in farley's employ  and  we are discussing a network deal
why janet
everyone loves the girl next door particularly farley
in my time they used to call me the merlin of berlin
we are the experts
out of self comes selflessness
thank you so much judge wright for another wonderful interview
judge wright  now betty first name terms surely
oh oliver you are so tolerant time for a coffee before you rush off
delighted betty  that is if you do not mind being seen with an older man
a free thinker
macy struthers  god i must have been blind  still the weaker the man the dumber the blonde
conspiracy  that sounds a little farfetched
it is happened before  remember lieutenant orpheus  he disappeared into that underworld series and never came back
sounds like my husband  he never came back either  at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break
now betty do not overreact
overreact  you are the one with theories about conspirac  oliver
yes betty
clever of you to find this spot betty
a 'stately pleasure home' indeed
look  look at that  bert schnick can see  whyhe isdancing
did you hear that oliver
he was a president
president  past presidents betty this is beginning to add up

not at all  you have your life  and i have mine
i will leave you young things to it
shove it ralph
that is us
i do not want to get up there
i am not going janet
what are you trying to do  make bert look like a fool  he is made all the arrangements
i am looking for love
some people do it for compassion
some people do it for the fashion
some people do it to be funny
i have took as much of you as any man can you have lost your heart
i have took as much of you as any man can
you have lost your heart
some people do it for for each other
some people do it for for their lovers
some people do it for for improvement
some people do it for movement
some people do it for for enjoyment
you will find a rambling rose and a picket fence
mental instability
he was adopted you know
oh harry  what are we going to do
wellmaybe i could wear my black leather brogues
mr  flavors  may i have a moment of your time
sure thing
we have heard rumors that you are going to unveil more than just a new series tonight  is this true
absolutely correct
could you tell us a little about it
let's just say that i am putting sanity back on the national menu
could i do that later
but they only think they are happy
i will not be a party to this  i want to see brad
the question is does brad want to see you  quite frankly he hates you
brad  oh brad

rosomoff i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents
no  no thank you  i have work
i heard about thorkel's order
my self  i do not matter  this human life all life insignificant  bodies bags of sleepy sluggish flesh
all right we may be insignificant imperfect creatures but we are all we have got
creation or its opposite
otto we are mere mortals you must never forget your own limits
i will repeat the experiment  i will hold the truth that is the only thing that matters
life and death matter yours everyone's  by comparison our search for truth is only a product of curiosity a game
truth  truth alone exists truth must be released
mr parker
peter what can i do for you
an extension on that astronomy paper  because uh
your dog ate it

pretty lame for such a smart kid
fortean phenomena  anomalies in our socalled reality weirdness my boy and lots of it

explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles
you are sure you are all right
imagine how i feel
excuse me if i am impertinent but how did you become whatever it is you are
the usual  heredity and environment  that is the deal with doc ock
he will try to finish his experiment
loonytunes  and yet
do you live around here
spiderman be careful  he is quite mad
professor you ever fly one of these things before
up here docky ocky
the captain would make a much more valuable hostage
it is working
i thought he was the chief engineer
he is
target their bridge
actually captain your precise target area was thirtyfive meters that way
but that was not so long ago it could not have been more than
twelve years sir
according to our information the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 391 years
what do you mean
this is its current position
courage is an emotion too data  now can you project the course of the ribbon
are any of them inhabited
approximately fortyseven minutes sir
data you are not thinking about using that thing are you
it has occurred to me on several occasions but i believe this may be the appropriate time
i believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response
really what do you feel
i get it i get it
during the farpoint mission we were on the bridge and you told a joke that was the punchline
the farpoint mission data that was seven years ago
i do not see a control panel or an access port
data this is not the time
data are you all right
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays
that is it bridge we are all out
sensors show five life signs aboard the station captain
looks like you are stuck with emotions for a while how do you feel
i am quitepreoccupied with concern about geordi
we all are data but we are going to get him back
could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak
i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters attempting to level our descent
can you locate them
we are within visual range of the energy distortion captain
we are within range sir
deck 15 section 21alpha
do you remember him
soran does not care about power or weapons all he cares about is getting back to the nexus
guinan that is going on where am i
this is the nexus
for you this is where you wanted to be
but i never had a wife children a home like this
all of us
where is he now
guinan can i leave the nexus
why would you want to leave
can i
yes where would you go
i do not understand
what makes you think things will be any different this time
you are right i will need help  guinan will you come back with me together we could
i am captain john harriman i would like to welcome you all aboard
well may we have a look around
excuse me gentlemen if you will take your seats
no no thank you
we do not have a tractor beam
what about the gravimetric distortions they will tear us apart
beautiful day is not it
this clock i gave this clock to bones
so you are telling me this is the 24thcentury and i am dead
not exactly as i said this is some kind of
you said history considers me dead who am i to argue with history
captain of the enterprise huh
that is right
close to retirement
how can i argue with the captain of the enterprise what was the name of that planet8a veridian iii
that is right
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim
i will find a way to contact the enterprise you are going to be all right
did we do it did we make a difference
yes  thank you
i am not going  scotty help me with this chute
what do you mean you are not going we promised
you know scotty it amazes me
and what would that be sir
sulu when did he find the time for a family
their life signs are are phasing in and out of our spacetime continuum
the first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death  scotty
but i do have a theory
i thought you might
an antimatter discharge directly ahead8a it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away
captain it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish
keep her together until i get back
kirk here
that is normal
normal is what everyone else is and what you are not
i do not want a science lecture you were on that observatory looking for trilithium why
what about guinan what has she told you about me
do not you think you are taking this a little too far number one
there's still no indication of why they attacked the station
we think they were looking for something they practically tore the place apart
hmm  inform starfleet command this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector
you want me to contact starfleet
is there a problem
no sir
understood that will be all
sir is there anything wrong
a quantum implosion has occurred within the amargosa star all nuclearfusion is breaking down
that is a pretty big margin of error
i always thought i would have a crack at this chair one day
captain are you all right
counselor what can i do for you
actually i am here to see if there's anything i can do for you
you felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line
my brother had shouldered that burden allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs
or perhaps they are on the surface
doctor soran
you must think i am quite the madman
we are all mortal soran it is one of the truths of ou existence
what if i told you i found a new truth
the nexus
careful captain that is a fifty gigawatt forcefield i would not want to see you get hurt
the royalstuds
it looks like we are too late
these blast patterns are consistent with type iii disruptors
have geordi and data go over with the next away team tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium
sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago
they have found a way to penetrate our shields
it is a class d12 bird of prey they were retired from service because of defective plasma coils
plasma coilsis there any way we can use that to our advantage
as their cloak begins to engage their shields will drop
worf prepare a spread of photon torpedoes we will have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak
but dear lord are we intelligent enough to  suppose this thing were used where life already exists
it would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix 
are you out of your vulcan mind no human can tolerate the radiation loose in there
but as you are so fond of observing doctor i am not human
you are not going in there  
physician heal thyself
that is all you have to say
would not it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship
bless me doctor and what beams you into this neck of the woods
romulan ale bones you know this stuff is illegal 
i only use it for medicinal purposes do not be a pring
twentytwo eightythree
i am almost afraid to what did you bring me contraband klingon 
cheers bones these are charming
four hundred years old you do not find many with the lens still intact
uh  what are they
for your eyes for most patients of your age i generally administer retlax five to restore flexibility of the lens
but i am allergic to retlax
slide them down your nose now look at me over the top and you read printed matter through the bottom
amazing i do not know what to say 
say thank you
damn it jim what the hell's the matter other people have birthdays why are we treating yours like a funeral
spare me your notions of poetry please we all have our assigned duties and
bull you are hiding  hiding behind the rules and regulations 
and who am i hiding from
what about the rest of the inspection admiral
it never rains but when it pours 
i have got the sick bay ready will someone please tell me what is going on
there may still be time you gave as good as you got
khan could be down there
he is been there and has not found what he wants can you spare someone there may be people hurt
go uwhereu are we going
but what if they went  nowhere
do you have anything to eat i do not know about anyone else but i am starved
how can you think of food at a time like this
now that is what i call a meal
lieutenant you are looking at the only starfleet cadet who ever beat the nowin scenario 
until now
hours instead of days saavik now we have minutes instead of hours 
you okay jim how do you feel
 come in please this is reliant calling regula i repeat this is uss reliant 
commander we are receiving this is regula i go ahead
the order comes from starfleet command dr marcus direct from the general staff
but genesis is a civilian project under my control 
jim read me can you read me
message breaking up carol that is wrong that is wrong
 cannot read you repeat
repeat that is wrong that is wrong
 taking genesis away from us
taking genesis who who is taking genesis
 see you but cannot hear did you order
what order who's taking genesis
david was right was not he it is just to keep them busy
is that a poem
how can you let them pull that stuff on you they are just lazy
thanks a lot no respect from my offspring 
go back i am going to kill him
so are we it looks like
david please
do not tell me you have got something
we have picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner
damn are you sure maybe the scanner's out of adjustment 
i suppose it ucouldu be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix
all right let's get on the commpic to doctor marcus maybe it is something we can transplant
are you sure these are the coordinates
captain this is the garden spot of ceti alpha vi 
you are crazy  
i saw it  
ubotany bayu  oh no
but the child 
a criminal captain  a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering 
he left us  we were no longer of use saavik where is  the reliant crew dead
beyond what i told you sir it is classified information
umm and would admiral kirk have access to such information
i would think so sir he is on the fleet general staff
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis
to doctor marcus the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i
well done commander
i am admiral kirk
where is dr marcus 
why did not you tell me
it is a long story
he is on a build up to detonation
how soon 
we encoded four minutes 
we will beam aboard and stop it 
i do not mean to intrude
uh no  i should be on the bridge
i suppose i was  i poured a drink would you like it
no i  i guess i am not what you expected
i did not expect anything
it was just words
but good words that is where ideas begin maybe you should listen to them
i am trying david
so am i my friends were killed too
i was wrong about you and ui amu sorry
is that what you came here to say
let go  he cannot  
what are you looking at
the admiral's son
do not you believe it
what are uyouu looking at
they are requesting visual communications sir
let them eat static
careful not all at once utheu uengine roomu lock on target and prepare to fire
sir  our shields are dropping
they will not 
at them at them fire fire why cannot you
we will lose them if they go in there
no sir we have genesis  whatever you want 
yours is the superior
you still remember admiral i cannot help but be touched of course i remember you
genesis that is that
do not play with me kirk my hand is on the phaser control 
give me some time to recall the data on our computers 
khan how do i know you will keep your word
i have given you no word to keep admiral in my judgment you simply have no alternative
time's up admiral
captain we are waiting that is the delay
all is well sir you have the coordinates to beam up genesis
aye sir
we will be going to warp speed 
scotty  that is left
just the batteries sir i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes 
we do not have minutes can you give me phaser power
just barely sir
i will need ten minutes sir until the radiation dissipates
uhura cannot you augment
she is not responding
try the emergency channels
enterprise to reliant come in reliant
mr scott on discrete
 no response sir
saavik for god's sake tell her we are all right
enterprise to reliant you are ordered to surrender your vessel respond  nothing sir
mr scott you old space dog you are well
i had me a wee bout  but dr mccoy pulled me through
midshipman you are a tiger
give the word admiral
mr scott the word is given
the energizer's bypassed like a christmas tree  so do not give me too many bumps
no sir you will flood the whole compartment
if he had not we would be space by now
yes spock
kirk to enterprise damage report spock
admiral if we go by the book like lieutenant saavik hours could seem like days
meaning you cannot even beam us back
spock this is kirk it is two hours are you about ready
and who is this
your first training voyage mr preston
yes sir
is the word given
i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets
it had the virtue of never having been tried
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality
so you said at the time speaking of which your protg's first rare  a trifle emotional 
she is half romulan jim the admixture makes her more volatile than  me for example
i know of your fondness for antiques
'it was the best of times it was the worst of times' message spock
hrummm and where are you off to now
permission to come aboard captain
welcome aboard admiral i believe you know my trainee crew certainly they have come to know you
there's a first time for everything admiral
something may be wrong at regula i we have been ordered to investigate
like all living beings admiral each according to his gifts the ship is yours
but it may be nothing garbled communications why do not you
there are two possibilities sir they are unwilling to respond they are unable to respond
how far
twelve hours and fortythree minutes present speed
give up genesis she said what in god's name does that mean give it up to whom
it literally is genesis
the power of creation 
have they proceeded with their experiments
that is she doing here
is it possible their comm system has failed  
their coil emissions are normal wait their shields are going up they are locking phasers  
they knew just where to hit us
who who knew just where to hit us and uwhyu
one thing is certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power
visual  mr sulu divert everything to the phasers 
not enough against their shields
the prefix code
let's hope he has not changed the combination he is quite intelligent
scanners and sensors still inoperative there's no way to tell that is  inside the station
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area
affirmative admiral
 blind as a tiberian bat what do you make of the plantoid beyond
regula is class d' it consists of various remarkable ores essentially a great rock in space
reliant could be hiding behind that rock
a distinct possibility
all right join the party mr spock the ship is yours
what is working around here
not much admiral we have partial main power
that is it
uh oh
she can outrun us and outgun us but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four
estimating nebula penetration in two minutes reliant is closing
admiral they are reducing speed
sporadic energy readings port side aft could be an impulse turn
he will not break off now if he followed me this far he will be back but from where
 the good of the few
kirk here
i have an urgent commpic from space lab regula i for the admiral dr carol marcus
in my quarters uhura
uhura that is happening damn it
transmission jammed at the source sir
any suggestions admiral
well mr saavik are you going to stay with the sinking ship
permission to speak candidly sir
very well
i do not believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities
and why not
because there was no way to win
a nowin situation is a possibility every commander may face has that never occurred to you
 no sir it has not
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life would not you say
as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me
lieutenant are you wearing your hair differently
may i speak sir
lieutenant selfexpression does not seem to be one of your problems
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
you earned it
i did not think so
you are bothered by your performance on the ukobayashi maruu
i failed to resolve the situation
there is no correct resolution it is a test of character
may i ask how uyouu dealt with the test
that was a little joke
humor that is a difficult concept  it is not logical
this is damned peculiar  yellow alert
on screen
begging the admiral's pardon general order 15 'no  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort'
indeterminate life signs
it does not make sense these coordinates are well within regula  a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless
if stage two was completed it was underground  she said it was going to be underground
that is on your mind lieutenant
are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now lieutenant
i changed the conditions of the test i received a commendation for original thinking  i do not like to lose
but the damage report  we were immobilized
regulation 46a 'if transmissions are being monitored during battle'
that was close 
hold your course look sharp
mr saavik all stop
all stop sir
cease fire look sharp
power levels quite low sir
saavik get us out best speed
time from my mark
two minutes ten seconds
three minutes thirty seconds
aye sir
i will be in my quarters if needed but i would prefer
understood sir
admiral on the bridge
as you were mr saavik
aye sir on course to ceti alpha all is well
yes well why do not you show him around and
i really must thank you
i am delighted any chance to go aboard enterprise however briefly is always an excuse for nostalgia
i cut your new orders personally by the end of the month you will have your first command uss excelsior
stop engines
course plotted for regula i admiral
mr sulu the shields
mr sulu lock phasers on target and await my command
approaching regula and space lab regula i
admiral on the bridge 
phaser lock inoperative sir
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
may i remind the captain that if a starship enters the zone 
i am aware of my responsibilities mister
shields activated
we are over our heads mr sulu get us out of here
aft thrusters mr sulu
we are clear and free to navigate
prepare for warp speed
we commend the soul of our brother departed we love we commit his body to the depths of space
fire all phasers
he is not what i expected sir
what did you expect lieutenant
very well mr saavik clear all moorings
all moorings are clear captain
lieutenant how many times have you piloted a starship out of spacedock
take her out mr saavik
sir may i quote general order 12 'on the approach of any vessel when communications have not been est 
lieutenant the admiral is aware of the regulations
you lied
i do not understand the final question
you are half human the computer knows that
as you wish since you deem them of value but i cannot wait here to find them
where must you go
to earth to offer testimony
you do this  for friendship
i do this because i was there
spock does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one
humans make illogical decisions
heard there was some excitement
how are you doing
fine just fine
do not tell me fish stories kiddo i have known you too long
back home we call him the miracle worker
no  no what did you have in mind
you sure this is such a bright idea
it will come back to him
are you sure  that is what i thought
bones stay here
now wait just a damn minute
you are really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket
 that is the general idea
that is crazy
it does not look all that different
oh joy
an experimental device doctor
wake up man wake up
he is coming 'round jim
congratulations jim i think you have saved the earth
hi busy
 my shoes
forget it  how about covering a little philosophical ground life death life things of that nature
it would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference
you are joking
a joke is a story with a humorous climax
you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death
really you think this is its way of saying hi there to the people of the earth
there are millions of other species on earth doctor only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man
specifically humpback whales
you just said there are not any except on earth of the past
that is what i said doctor
angels and ministers of grace defend us
naturally  so what is your problem
acceleration is no longer a constant
well you are gonna have to take your best shot
 best shot
guess spock your best guess
guessing is not in my nature
 i do not think he understands
you are saying it is a compliment
who are you doctor adams was supposed to assist me
we are just  observing
what the hell do you think you are doing
that is your degree in dentistry
how do you explain slowing pulse low respiratory rate and coma
fundoscopic examination 
fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases
that is causing that
captain their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power
can you isolate the wave
damage report
captain all systems have failed we are functioning on reserve power only
find it
team leader this is team 2   come in please
i have the coordinates of the reactor
how long
all right commander you wanna tell us anything
like what
my name is pavel chekov i am a lt commander in starfleet united federation of planets service number 6565827b
all right let's take it from the top
my name
no umyu name
i do not know your name
you play games with me and you are through
okay make nice and give us the ray gun
i varn you if you do not lie on the floor i vill have to stun you
go ahead stun me
operational admiral cloaking device now available in all modes of flight
no sir and no federation wessels on assigned patrol stations
shields mr chekov
shields aye
no choice now scotty
yes sir
ah well done team 2
and admiral it is the enterprise
cloaking device is stable all systems normal
the mains are down sir aux power is not responding
neutralized how
we do not know it is using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand
can you protect us
attempting the hell to communicate
they like you very much but they are not the hell your whales
i suppose they told you that
so you were at berkeley
you sure you will not change your mind
despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return george and gracie to the open sea
i assure you that will not be necessary we were only trying to help
back to san francisco
came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies huh
there's really very little point in my trying to explain
we do not want to be any trouble
memory problems too
can i ask uyouu something
go ahead
they are gonna hafta take their chances
no ma'am no dipshit
in fact we may be able to help  in ways that frankly you could not possibly imagine
or believe i will bet
just a little joke see you later old friend
he is just going to hang around the bushes while we eat
so how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist
just lucky i guess
you are upset about losing the whales
 you are very perceptive
how will that be done exactly
they will be flown in a special 747 to alaska and released there
you know i could take those whales somewhere they would not be hunted
thanks cheers
my whales where could you take them where they would be safe
it is not so much a matter of a place as of time
sorry the time would have to be right now
that is that
that is what
wanna try it from the top
tell me when the whales are going to be released
 who are you
do not tell me you are from outer space
no i am from iowa i just work in outer space
well i was close i knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later
all right the truth
well why did not you say so why all the coy disguises
you want the details
are you kidding i would not miss this for all the tea in china
it would not be my first choice no
it is true what you said
steady now we need your help
have i flipped out  is any of this real
it is all real look  the storage tanks for the whales
but kirk
we will bring them up just like we brought you it is called a transporter beam
what kind of spaceship is this anyway
if we keep going up they will catch us
gillian would the whales be at sea by now
yes if you have a chart on board i can show you
all i need is the radio frequency to track them
what are you talking about i am coming with you
you cannot our next stop is the 23rd century
what do i care i have got nobody but those whales
i have no time to argue gillian or even tell you how much you have meant to us the ufrequencyu
all right the frequency is 401 megahertz
you tricked me
oh my god we are too late
you mean this is  goodbye
permission to come aboard
permission granted
thank you admiral
spock  you are suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man
a distinct possibility admiral the president did say the transmission was directed at the earth's oceans
where are you going
spock could the humpback's answer to this call be simulated
the sounds but not the language we would be responding in gibberish
is there any other planet where this species exists
the humpback was indigenous to earth earth of the past
that leaves us no choice we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth
that would be futile admiral the probe would neutralize us easily
but we cannot turn away is there no alternative
mr spock your computations
in progress admiral
ready to engage computer admiral
what is our target in time
the late 20th century
surely you can be more specific
not with this equipment i have had to program some of the variables from memory
you have programmed that from memory
earth but when spock
judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere i believe we have arrived at the late 20th century
home in on the strongest signal descend from orbit
admiral if i may we are probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time
where would we find these reactors theoretically
were not those a birthday present from dr mccoy
how do you know this
oh the complete works of jacqueline susan the novels of harold robbins
about those colorful metaphors we discussed i do not think you should try to use them
why not
well for one thing you have not quite got the hang of it
i see
and another thing it is not always necessary to tell the truth
i cannot tell a lie
you have done it before cannot you remember
the hell i cannot
what else did you learn from your mind meld
they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man
they have a right to be  do you think they will help us
i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions
the tank will be finished by morning
that is cutting it closer than you know what about team two
admiral full power is restored
admiral may i suggest that dr mccoy is correct we must help chekov
is that the logical thing to do spock
no admiral but is the human thing to do
mr spock where the hell is the power you promised me
mr scott cannot give me exact figures admiral so i will  make a uguessu
spock did braking thrusters fire
they did admiral
spock condition report
guidance is functional onboard computer will interface with federation memory bank
estimating planet earth one point six hours present speed
warp two three
warp nine nine point two nine point three
mr sulu we need breakaway speed
hang on sir nine point seven point eight breakaway threshold
mr sulu  mr sulu
 aye sir
what is our condition
sir braking thrusters seem to have fired
aye sir descending
ready sir
maintaining impulse climb wing five by zero helm steady
advise reaching 10000 steer threeonezero
threeonezero aye
10000 msl admiral
wing to cruise configuration full impulse power
10 seconds sir
i have no control sir
sir  i have got some back pressure on manual 
let's see what she is got mr sulu
systems report  communications
communications systems ready communications officer  ready as she will ever be
what is it
overlapping distress calls some from starships others
then this is what it would sound like underwater
admiral i am receiving whale songs
individual whale song getting stronger this is strange admiral the song is directly ahead it is coming from san francisco
we will stick together till we get orientated bearing to the whales
283 degrees 152 kilometers
any luck
nothing i should never have left him
i have found chekov sir he is in emergency surgery right now
uhura where
bearing 327 range 600 nautical
admiral i have a signal closing on the whales bearing 328 degrees
estimate range ship to whales
unidentified aircraft 40000 feet msl range 30 miles bearing 010
i cannot sir  nothing
mr scott how soon can we get underway
scotty how long is this bay
about 60 feet admiral
that should be enough can you enclose it to hold water
scotty we have to find some humpbacks
humpbacked  people
whales scotty 45 to 50 feet long about 40 tons a piece
admiral  how am i going to handle all that weight
they are giving out decrystallizing
what is it i thought i told you never to call me 
sorry admiral we just thought you will like to know we are beaming them now
it is going slow sir it will be well into tomorrow
i am ready spock let's go find george and gracie
scotty are the whale tanks secure
stay with me sir  i need more power curve
how long scotty
admiral there be whales here
well done mr scott how soon can we be ready for warp speed
i will have to reenergize
stand by sir miracle worker at work
mr scott do not make jokes we are in danger of 
full power sir
ironic when man was killing these creatures he was destroying his own future
you better get up there sir we are having some power falloff
the whales
no power to the bay doors
the explosive override  
it is under water there's no way to reach it
go on ahead close the hatch
excelsior why in god's name would you want that bucket of bolts
admiral i would like to continue my work on the ship until you leave
thank you lt saavik
and here is a deposition i have made if it is not sufficient i will return to earth to testify
do not concern yourself saavik your leave has been granted for good and proper cause  how are you feeling
i am well admiral
vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the federation
your vessel did destroy uss grissom your men did kill kirk's son do you deny these events
we deny nothing we have the right to preserve our race
professor scott if you will 
with pleasure
well that is different
if you will follow me professor 
i will can my assistant come too
i notice you are still working with polymers
hello computer
just use the keyboard
transparent aluminum
that is the ticket laddie
hi huey 205 is not it
right on you fly
oh here and there  i flew something similar in my academy days
all right then this is old stuff to you
i will be returning to vulcan within the hour i wanted to take my leave of you
it is kind of you to make this effort
it is not an effort you are my son  besides i am most impressed with your performance in this  crises
they are my friends
yes of course do you have any message for your mother
ojichan akira ojichaan dewa naino koko de nani shiteru no  
gomen nasarei hito chigai de gozaranuka na  i am sorry my son you have mis taken me for someone else
chotto omachi nasarei namae wa nanto moosareruka na  wait my son what is your name
benny god take it easy
right in line with that burning tree
i do not see anything
what did i tell you
do not you think you should call a backup
mike call for backup  benny you all right
i do not think so 
gate three it is boarding now
thank you
what can i do for you folks
how much are your rooms
i will take that
fill this out  will this be cash or credit card
credit card
i will have to run your card off now
we are only going to be here a few hours
do you have a good map of death valley
food eat i prepare food i work as a cook that is how i make money
i understand
what do you do
i make maps
hey that sounds interesting you like it
eh yes
what do you think of america
well here we are you go down that ramp there you are sure to get a ride
no no
where did you stop last
what the hell do you think you are doing
where did you stop last
stay right there
where is that
recognize this
it is a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes
houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit
it is real george
there's no mistake you are absolutely sure
i saw it with my own eyes we have killed an extraterrestrial and
we will need a lot of help george you could hide an army up here
i am going to the white house right now i will try and get you everything you need
contain it and get back to me
then it is not an accident that they found us
we do not think that is necessarily bad at least it is a point of contact
not necessarily bad if they knew we were here why did not they let us know they were coming
we will get those answers when you find the one you are looking for
george we have just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial
when can we expect containment
well we are in pursuit of a green mustang
why did you let it get into a populated area
it is taken on a disguise
clarify that
the extraterrestrial now looks like this
i am afraid the situation demands that kind of risk
i do not like it george
dammit shermin earlier you were asking for help that is changed
it is messy the thing's got a gun we are just asking for somebody to get killed
we do not know what else to do we need results
you will get results one way or the other that is for sure okay
i will make this as simple as i can george they disappeared
that is all this for
we have a new directive i am taking over
we do not have to do it that way we can catch him this time
that is the chance we have to take
no we do not
then you are going to have to do it without me
no deal
i just retired
mrs haydn
this is george fox
i want to speak to marc shermin
you can speak to me mrs haydn i am in charge of this operation now
i will not let anyone hurt you
is the man who kidnapped you there now

your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride
the car will stop
when do i get to lathrop wells
what happened
why did your ship land on this planet on earth
you thought we were a different planet
no my ship was doing a map of all the suns and
oh that is terrible i am sorry was he a good friend
i understand
sounds like your captaings going to get hell when he gets back home
what is hell
it is bad
what are you doing
i like this music
i have noticed do you understand what they are saying
i would like to hear it can you sing something
i do not want to
i am not a good singer

here are two quarters when you lose these you are not going to get anymore
this is crazy we do not have time for this
i want to get money for you and the baby
i do not need any money for the baby i will be fine
inflation tuition college children are damned expensive i know
it will tell you pretty much everything about us
this is very interesting we are born knowing our history we have other books but not a book like this
any words you do not know you can find in the dictionary
what will you say about us
i will say that we can be friends
this is yours
if you want to keep it you can
would you put some of your singing in this for the baby

i know
neither do i i guess
you fit in it is lonely it is rough at first but you fit in you got no choice
yeah sorry wizard
i am donald fettes
i am very pleased to know you master fettes
mr gray
dr macfarlane said i should pay you 
i fear he may have to
but cannot you give me any idea
oh you will have ample opportunity  ample   good morning dr fettes
you asked to see me ma'am
i want you to help my little girl
i do not know that i can do that mrs marsh
i did not mean it that way  i meant only that i am not in a position to ask favors
ask this one favor 
good morning mrs marsh
even so i could never think of going on  i have got to find some other profession
you must leave this house
i cannot do that  you heard macfarlane
save yourself master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned
you are overexcited mistress cameron
but that is long since  gray cannot threaten him with that
gray has no need to threaten you remember the trial
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums it was a famous case
he is not home
where can i find him
you do not went to find him your news will keep until i tell him
at pennycuik  i know the inn  i can be there in an hour
excuse me dr macfarlane 
but doctor i only wanted to speak to you 
dr macfarlane 
i am afraid i will have to give up medicine dr macfarlane
i thought only the best students were made assistants
well and are you not a good student
you know how we get the specimens we use for dissection
and that is why you do not want to be a doctor fettes
dr macfarlane  you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday  the lady with the little girl
it was about last night i wanted to talk to you  about the operation on the little marsh girl
you are a man of the world fettes you would not hold me to promise given in drink
but i  well you see sir i met mrs marsh and told her
really fettes you irk me with your lack of understanding
wilmont used up the last spinal section
you see it is completely out of the question
yes i suppose so
every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one
gray killed her
we cannot be sure of that
i would not do that fettes  i would not report it
here is where you must watch closely gentleman  closely  it is the very heart of the matter 
i just saw gray  what was he laughing at
when she is ready you bring her to me  i will show her how
dr macfarlane i wonder if you know what happiness you have brought those people
i suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor
glencorse  that is a lonely cemetery fettes not a soul around for miles
they will be thinking of that too
tosh  fettes  it is not their grief i am worrying about  i am talking of our own end 
where shall we put it in the back
this is not a woman
it was a woman when we put her in
are you a doctor too
not yet
what you really want to ask me is about my back is not it  about where it hurts
hear him
the white horse  the horse that is going to greet me when he sees me
why do you want the white horse to bid you goodday
he was a nice horse
aye but i still wonder how much
i thought this was a school day
you will not need that again georgina
he will not leave the grave  not since wednesday last when we buried the lad
not much danger here ma'am i would not think  right here in the heart of edinburgh
they are uncommon bold the grave robbers  and the daft doctors who drive them on
i am by way of being a medical myself
a doctor
come toddy  come  sit down here with me
mr fettes and i have professional matters to discuss
i will not have you use that name to me
you are a teacher eh  maybe you are afraid to be a doctor toddy
afraid of what
afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be
i am the best man for the job
i will not do it gray
it might be an interesting case
toddy hates me
do not call me that confounded name i tell you
oh it is you gray well come in sit down have a glass with me
you know something about the human body gray
oh it is the bit of a girl fettes was talking about
you cannot build life like you put together blocks toddy
what are you talking about i am an anatomist i know the body i know how it works
and you are a fool toddy  and no doctor it is only the dead ones that you know
the heart pumps it
did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot
the nerve centers  the brain 
but what makes a thought start
what are you going here have i not told you 
i brought you something tonight macfarlane  an interesting specimen  in very good condition
i have ordered nothing from you
this is a gift
i take no gifts from you
this is a gift you will not return
get out of here
gray i must rid myself of you  you have become a cancer  a malignant evil cancer  rotting my mind
so toddy you have made me a disease eh
surely you are not threatening an old friend toddy
have another glass of something good toddy
i have drunk enough tonight
i have other means of sustenance
would you bribe me to leave you be
i would make you rich
it would not be half so much fun for me toddy as to have you come here and beg 
well then  i beg you  i beseech you 
but why gray why
because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more toddy you are a pleasure to me
i presume you shall  this will not be my last visit here
i want to speak to you alone  i saw something  i heard
what did you hear
can anyone hear what we say
only brother
you say you have come here on your own account  no one knows you are here
i have made you give me money but you smile are not you angry
you and i should work together
you mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together dig them up
no digging joseph the churchyards are too well guarded we will burke them
burke them
you are lately come to scotland joseph
i come from lisbon
the ruffian dogs the hellish pair  the villain burke the meager hare 
i do not understand the song tell me plain how they did it
how long after that was the paralysis complete
nearly a year
any attacks of pain since
yes doctor
is her pain sporadic or constant
it comes at intervals  they used to be months apart  but they have been growing more frequent   much more frequent
child seems to take to the lad what sort of an accident was it ma'am

your father
all his years at sea he never stopped talking about these islands
i would have liked to have said goodbye
he knows
you sound so sure
you may not like what you hear
i can take it
why did we begin this
we were idealists
because we believed we could make an impact out here  self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing
i have not forgotten
phil he is not looking inside  he is just striking out at the world
what are they doing
oh i was walking down lime street one day
hey  weigh  blow the man down
a pretty young maiden she happened my way
so to all you sailors who have fought wind and whale
weight  hey  blow the man down
she said none the better you all go to hell
everyone aboard young bill

why was not i made aware of this bill
come in
skipper uh the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side
well that is all part of it
everyone out of the rigging now
carry on
yes sir
why did not you drop any sail
skipper called us out of the rigging
but your instinct was to lose sail
my instinct was to not get electrocuted
butler what would i ever do to you
it did not go over until i turned her starboard
there's still a way
what do you mean
make us proud
where is mom

hey shut up will ya

well that is just typical is not it
is it true phil
i gotta go
you were not there you do not know what happened

uh huh
would you um say it is a big storm
that is on your mind
well spit it out
why do you think i am sending him home
the dolphin was a symptom
of what
of a fight he cannot win out here
does phil know how you guys feel
i do not know
chicken is a fool's game captain
so is violating international law
but you invited is aboard
stow away
he left his passport in curacao it is being mailed to panama
then what do you think he was trying to do
i am francis boutillier  this is my son philip
your cable said you would not be putting out until midoctober
as you can see there's a lot to do
and i would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here
it will be more than that i can promise you
we will do our best  you are welcome to say goodbye
well we thought we would drop in and see if you were all still in one piece
and of course we are
what is it we can do for you today
that is wrong you do not like steak
i should be eating with the crew
humor me  eat it anyway
i can take care of myself
it has nothing to do with him
well what does it have to do with us
who is it philip
i think you were too hard on weathers
you do
what  that is happening
you are officer of the watch george
i guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be
that is that
spirits have a way of bringing that out
that is that
jesus  she is got guns
yeah well you are really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you did not
that is enough
how the hell are we gonna get outta here
we will think of something
hell they even kicked me outa vo tech 'cause i could not read a slide rule
me too
jesus  what the hell happened to him
that is your problem
why would you jump
because i felt like it  what do you care
i could not do it
do not ever call me stupid
i will read it  i mean i do not mind
if you have got a broad available i will take her
how would you know
trust me donut  i know
damn porkchop you sound just like a guy who ai not never seen a pair
they tell you that
it matters to me
why man
i do not
that is not a satisfactory answer
the rust will not wait for you to read conrad goodall
then he should not have written such a long poem mr lawford
well that was neighborly
that is wrong mr lawford
what do you think
we have got a problem
that is that
terry left his passport in curacao we could hide him
if he is a cuban castro wears a dress
you gotta be kidding  he is a human chum line
fuck off man  it is just a fish
you are the one who does not care phil
it hurts too much to care
about yourself
how long you been standing there
what are we supposed to talk about
you have gotta be kidding
but they do not speak english
phil  what are you doing
fandango junior  i am gonna do some limbo baby

i am not gonna kill it
that is it going to be
i am sorry
what are you blubbering about
do not look down  look in my eyes climb  we will do it together
are you hating this  are you
is it true that you forced robin weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic
he climbed when he was ready
sir were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew
what makes you so sure it was one
i cannot be sure
you really felt that your crew were up for the conditions
we would come twelve thousand miles together through every kind of seas imaginable
except a white squall  with all due respect captain sheldrake they are only boys
they are much more than that sir
is it true that the reason you expelled philip boutillier
for killing a dolphin
yes that is true
do you think this is funny  some kind of joke  you lost six people out there
i understand
how would you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as francis boutillier
it was not hard
i used to helm a school ship  a long time ago
the families want your ticket turn it in we forget the whole thing  everybody goes home
and you did not do anything about it
if this young man had responded instantly to your command do you believe the ship might have been spared
i do not know that anything could have prevented what happened

that is one girl who cannot take a hint
she asleep
pictures from the play jamie looks pretty 
i am sorry about how we 
no you are with who you should be it is like she chose you
and i have no idea why
what if they expel you
kelly would not do that
why not
i am not hanging i am fixing my car 
you do not need a car you cannot drive for a month go see marvin
about what
your father dropped off an extra check
i do not want his money
it could help with a new car 
out with belinda
that is over way over
you saw him
you look nice i should have dressed
you are fine like that mom
i have not seen clay or eric lately
to see your father
a late night or an early morning
late night  you
honey some of this is farfetched you take after me people skills and common sense good dependable qualities
i could take after dad too
you do you are handsome and charming
i could do it if i tried even kelly thinks so
but if it does not happen grab for something within reach life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment 
have i told you how proud i am of you  
i am sorry i did not know
what are you doing here
he wants to talk to you
now it is okay
everything's being done but it is not enough i have to find something  more
where is he he is supposed to be here
i am thinking
do not call him a dipshit
you do 
the address
she is like some puritan
belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real
and that you are scamming on jamie sullivan
say nothing nothing about her
who are you
i am very sorry 
get yourself a glass
he goes to my father's church he could have died 
 this your idea of small talk
you do not know me
you mean care what you say i am worrying about other things
like what the moons of jupiter
cannot you have a normal conversation
i do not want to have any conversation
'i hope your dreams come true'
'they will not'
'is it really me'
you are like this fly buzzing buzzing everywhere 
 this play means a lot to me
this play  
that is deep 
 your act only works with an audience
i know you do not want help
fire is like a living thing wild unpredictable
like me
what the  
that is with the friggin numbers
28 is do something illegal 42 is befriend an enemy
i am an enemy
you got some kind of list
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know
i will take a chance
go for it
so what else is on this list
it is private
get very wasted lose your virginity 
no problem 
i will get something for us to drink 
i know do not say anything
he is a softy got him wrapped around my finger
you think so
because i try to be nice to people
yeah maybe i dunno
cuz it is dark and quiet and you can see into another world
the world of the dead
what is that
saturn beautiful
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings 
but there are thousands of them made of floating ice 
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart
looking for intelligent life
do you believe you will see your mother again
i am building a larger one to see the nucleus of haley's comet 
the dirty snowball at its core
yeah  i am probably not going to be around next time it comes
you are really into god right
my relationship with god is my own
but you think about him  it  her
you have to believe to have faith
you do not believe in anything
the bible why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles
interpreted by another guy like my father
he does not trust you
the play's going to be really good
you are not in a very good mood
the play's in a couple of weeks
or anywhere where people might see us
belinda's a very jealous person
so it is like you want to be secret friends
that is it exactly you are reading my mind 
he okay
you were great the other night
i have not been nice to you
people can see
maybe you inspire me
all of it
it is not
okay maybe some of that is true 
you do not know the first thing about being someone's friend 
i do not want to be just your friend 
you do not know what you want 
you do not either take a look at yourself maybe you are scared that someone might actually like you 
and why would that scare me
it is a start
so you are talking to me
what does that mean
she great or what
why are you doing all this to impress me
yes but not as a date date
why not
i cannot believe you asked my father's permission
is there a rush
i have to get you home by one
it is only 730
before we do this
it is about working with what you already have  right now  at your fingertips  you know spontaneously
you are acting like a crazy person
it is places like this that make me certain there's a god
you are sometimes not sure
we can measure wind
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable
what do you actually know with religion
i do not understand
i might do it wrong
assholes this happen to you
that is wr
how do you know this place
from here he proved to me the earth is not flat  on rainy days we would be above the clouds
what would you do up here
what would you tell your father
when did you build this
it is an altazimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one
a thermos of hot coffee a blanket socks
you planned this 
are you trying to seduce me
what about your father
here why am i looking at this star
from citizen high to citizen low
i do not care

that what you do
one of your secrets
you are worried about your college applications

up to
i saw the way he looked at you the way he kissed you
it was a play
boys like him have  expectations

admiring your handiwork
touring the riot scene  gravely assessing the devastation upstanding mayor stuff

uncle alfred left for america  much to my mother's dismay 
you certainly will not
i guess they do not have fax machines on elephants
i have been trying to reach wilfred with no success  as one grows older one yearns for family
it is good to see you again uncle i have missed you
i am sorry  i was too late
uncle alfred

perhaps the truth is you do not really trust anyone
i must have dozed off  my sincerest apologies sir

well i hope you will stay with us
oh but sir  so much goes on
is there something wrong sir
but i cannot can i
i am as well as can be expected

attending to heroes  no sir  my only regret is that i was never able to be out there with you
i love you old man
alfred old friend i could use your help right now
it is good to see you
that sir does not compute
first ivy had an intoxicating effect on both dick and me  tonight my feelings spread to someone else
glandular secretions from animals scents that create powerful emotions  fear  rage
what is it
i am on break from
oxbridge academy
their new computer sciences division  how did you know
sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win
hey i am the one who kicked ivy's botanical butt  personally  me  i did
please be looking for me
al's main squeeze  is she here  i am about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue right
i could have made it you know  i did not need your help
this is to replace the bike i lost i will get you the rest

alpha  got it  what the hell is attack plan alpha
youwsa  nothing but air
this is easy
crimefighter's rule number two
i am afraid to ask
pow  what  kazow
what exactly are you doing
it will take the satellites about a minute to realign butdamn
damn  damn is not good
you were a great scientist once do not squander your genius on evil
after you have frozen your icy tomb will plummet back to gotham
go on kill me too  just as you killed my wife
nice suit  and today you are
nightwing  scourge of darkest evil
this is all about fashion for you is not it
 a giant drilling truck burrowing under the city 
mr freeze
the batcomputer tracks him heading for the gotham museum
the new antiquities exhibit  the second sun of the sudan
of course  he is going to steal the giant white diamond
i was just hanging around
i thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs
watch the first step
you think freeze will take the bait
you do not have two million  three million  
pull back  you cannot make the jump
i know  the feeling just vanished
i cannot believe we were fighting over a  bad guy
bad yes  guy no  this is one majorly beautiful evil person
i am totally over her  positively
how did you
can he save her
no beauty
remember the victim at the airport toxins introduced through the mouth
what are you talking about
we gotta get those locks changed
she knows who we are
i guess we will just have to kill her
no sign of the snowman
if we could relay the sunlight
winded old timer
they are overly protective  you are not going to hurt me are you ms
dr pamela isley
what can i do for you doctor  a research grant  a hospital wing
actually i already work for you or did  your arboreal preservation project in south america
we cut our support  a conflict of ideologies  dr woodrue was a lunatic
i see you knew him
that lab was consumed by fire last week  how did you manage to escape
acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet
physical perfection charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster how do you explain your behavior
umm  what i mean isno plans at the moment
you are not even listening to me
julie i am not the marrying kind there are things about me you would not understand
i know you are a dedicated bachelor that you have had a your wild nights
wild does not exactly cover it
but there's nothing you have done under the cover of darkness i could not learn to understand
you just called me ivy  who's ivy
that is gotta hurt
what happened to his wife
i need the wayne diamonds
we gonna trap ourselves a snowman
absolutely  just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator
whoa i made a mistake  i am sorry do not go all protective on me  it will not happen again
i got the diamond  quell problemo bruce
of course  alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room
he is dying  and i cannot deal with it
talk to him bruce  there's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel
i checked the medical database  no one else is even close
i am late for the dedication  then i go after freeze and ivy  alone
like hell you do
that is no batlight it is a birdcall
her name is pamela isley  i saw her talking to gordon  she must have stolen his keys altered the signal
and she did it all for me  for love
she is infected us with some kind of pheromone extract
is that it bruce  i am under some magic spell
she wants to kill you
an enticing offer  but what does the lady want in return
i love that belt  what are you about a fifty big and tall
no gun  how disarming
i wonder if i can get a cell with a view of the gardens
my reserves are exhausted  i must have the gems that power my suit
in my weakened state i am no match for the bat and the bird
trust me  vegetable magnetism
fine  while i retrieve my diamonds you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair  she is frozen in 
you will rescue my wife
make yourself right at home
where is my wife
there was nothing i could do  batman deactivated her  she is dead
you will distract the bat and bird while i prepare to freeze gotham
cannot we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry
the way to a boy's heart is through his ego  what strapping young hero could resist his very ownsignal
inspired ms ivy
prepare for a bitter harvest winter has come at last
freezy i am feelinghot
to be frozen  to never change  a life of perpetual iceolation there is little perfection in that
what say we turn up the heat
you are skating on thin ice  my passion thaws for my bride alone
forget your frosty femme  these lips are wet and ready to get frostbite
give it up  if you threw yourself
how about dangerous curves
of trust tell me your plan
kiss me and i will tell you
tell me and i will kiss you
freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun  he is about to turn gotham into an ice cube
i have got to stop him
bad luck i am afraid  it is time to die little bird
what do you mean
you should have heeded your pointy eared pal  these lips can be murder
you are too late  say byebye birdie
you have to tell me what you are doing with my venom
our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications he cut the funding for our work 
our work
dr isley  pamela  you look great especially for a dead woman
the dreams again sir
i think they are getting worse
would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment
then you would have nothing to complain about
how is the sonar coming alfred
a few hitches sir but i am confident we will have a prototype in no time
it will never work
scholarly research
she has an excellent mind
if i misinterpreted your interest in the lady i humbly apologize
i wonder if she would go out with me
do you remember the night i fell into that cave and the bat chased me
gee i am not sure  alfred how many rooms total
ninetythree including the sauna
what did you say
he killed them twoface he slaughtered that boy's parents
no you said i i killed them
sorry to bother you sir i have some rather distressing news about master dick
is he all right
i am afraid master dick has gone traveling
he ran away
actually he took the car
he boosted the jag  is that all
not the jaguar the _other_ car
the _rolls_
maybe they are right
which they' might that be sir
why do i keep doing this
why indeed
could i let batman go for dick for me could i leave the shadows have a life friends family
perhaps perhaps not why not ask the lady
how are you feeling young man
not that young it is been a long time since you have called me that
old habits die hard are you alright
perhaps the fall
i remember a bat a monster a demon chasing me  oh my god alfred
master bruce
all the answers are numbers
but 1 3 1 8 & 5 what do they mean
what do maniacs always want
recognition of course
letters in the alphabet
of course 13 is mmre
what now sir
claw island nygma's headquarters i am sure that is where they are keeping chase  are all the batsuits destroyed
all except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of but it has not yet been tested
welcome master grayson i am alfred
may i help you master grayson
how come this is the only locked door around this museum that is back there
up here al
just checking young sir
dual personalities abnormal psychology washingtongs poster child for the criminally insane i read your work
i am flattered not every girl makes a superhero's night table  you might have some interesting insights into twoface
he is home i sent the signal
i wish i could say my interest in you was purely professional
are you trying to get under my cape doctor
a girl cannot live by psychoses alone
now black rubber
try a fireman less to take off

bruce wayne in the flesh
mr nygma you will forgive me for being rude but what exactly is on your mind
call my secretary she will set something up  factory looks great folks  keep up the good work
wait you cannot go
we will talk some other 
so glad you could come

how can i help you mr wayne
psychiatrists make you nervous
just ones this beautiful
the infamous wayne charm does it ever shut off
still play with dolls doctor
she is a malaysian dream warden she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams  need one
my opinion this letter writer is a total wacko
wacko that a technical term
patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles work better for you
i think the question would be do you have a thing for bats
so this riddler he is dangerous
what do you know about obsession
it is a stretch but i will manage
the letter writer is obsessed with you his only escape may be
to kill me
you understand obsession better than you let on
no insights here doc just trying to get comfortable on your couch  oops times up

recognize him
from the surveillance footage in the bloodbank  he was one of the guard's nomak attacked
if that is true what about nomak  he is been alive longer than the others
like cancer with a purpose
he is right about one thing  we do have to survive
blade  we have got six reapers  they are all dead
anyone else make it
thank you
for what
it would have been easy for you to let me die back there today but you did not
because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends
why do you hate us so much
you are hurting me
it means bloodbrother
how does it look
what do you want me to do
how do you feel
you came back for me
did you think i would not
let's just hope you have kicked the thirst for good  i will be watching you close you start to backslide 
i agree  we play along for now we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks
what do you think
sounds like a plan
he is right  they will smell that you are human  stay here watch our backs
i do not like it
i thought you were supposed to be watching our backs
where were you whistler
you ask me you and miss muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste
pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy
your security's for shit kid
where the hell have you been
that is your problem whistler
and so will we
look i care about the humans who are dying not you got it
spare me the race card oj  we are not going out into the sun  it is too risky
put it back in park blade
thought you were dead
you want me to hunt them for you
the genetic material you spliced into nomak   where did you get it
and why is that
you got something in mind blade
gonna try and od whistler on a retroviral cure
so you are going to do this
that is going on
kiss your ass goodbye reinhardt
hey hey  the fuck you doing
getting your attention paco
listen hillbilly you are a cunthair away from cowboy heaven
we want to attract them not scare them off
nomak said something to blade in greek athelfiki singenia ex amato  where did he learn that
from his father of course
we are locked in
are you insane  he will kill us both
they have made contact with the reapers
any casualties
an inevitability i suppose  nyssa was not among them i trust
you worry too much stevens  i have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted
i see from your questionnaire that you do not have any immediate next of kin
not that i am in contact with
nobody to call in case of an emergency
no   does that mean i cannot be a donor
your blood has a very rare phenotype one that is quite valuable to people like us
gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping
fuck yeah  whole package will crank this betty up another threehundred horsepower
where would you dig up this shitbird anyway
the hell are you fiddling with there
tweaked the phosphor rod modified the collimated beam wanna concentrate the light get something like a uv laser going
you are wasting your time already been tried
yeah but you did not have the scudster working on it did you

so how long have you known blade anyway
going on twenty years now
blade does not talk about the old days much
what about you  you are not coming

so how do you know the owner mr bianchinni
i do not really  i was referred to him
do you know him
no but caesar does  he likes him says he is a good italian
caesar is your husband
oh no  shit  i did not know he would call you  god you must think i am a total nuisance
he said you lost something
i am sorry look forget it  i should not have called
thank you so much  you have to let me pay you something 
okay one drink
what do you want
a beer
curious maybe
you dropped that earring down the drain on purpose did not you
i had to see you
look i do not think this is a good idea
i wanted to apologize
  i needed that
caesar's mafia is not he
funny nobody calls it that anymore caesar calls it the business
how did you meet him
they took over a club i was working at  caesar started managing it
how long have you been with him
almost five years
five years is a long time
is not that what you wanted to know what i did time for
the redistribution of wealth
that is what i tell someone when i am trying to get them in my bed
i am already in your bed
you did not have to tell me if you did not want to
i guess i wanted to
i am glad you did
yes there is  i felt it this morning when i brought you the coffee
shit here we go
you did not want to see me did you
if there is one thing i cannot stand about sleeping with women it is all the fucking mind reading
what are you afraid of
i am not afraid of anything
i do not understand  
i know  you cannot understand because we are different violet  we are different
we are not that different corky
how can you sit in that bed and say that
oh no she is nothing like you  she is a lot smarter than you
is that what her daddy tells her
i know what i am  i do not need to have it tattooed on my shoulder
what are you saying  that you do not have sex with men
i do not
for christ's sake violet  i heard you  thin walls remember
what you heard was not sex
what about that guy this morning
you mean shelly
do not tell me you are a workaholic
no  shelly knows what i am  he saw me in a bar with another woman
fuck it  i think you better leave
for what
you made a choice once  do you think you would make that same choice again
what choice
caesar is going to get the money and bring 
how much money
that is why i need your help  you said you were good
all right let's say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying
all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected someone like me
do you think you know me like that
then what  exactly
and where is it now
it is in a case on his desk
it sounded like he and caesar do not like each other
gino marzzone
marzzone  as in angelo marzzone head of the marzzone family
yeah twice
does johnnie hit on you
johnnie hits on anything in high heels
has caesar ever seen him
he does it right in front of him
what did gino drink
what time did you say they would be there
the plane is in at seven so i would say about eight
any bodyguards
we want him to come down to relax feel in control again
where will you be
and as you do the bottle will slip from your hands   and shatter against the hardwood floor
an accident
what if he sees you
you cannot know for certain that he will not see you
i am just asking what if
there is no going back
when i get the scotch how do i know you will not take off
if it is real enough he will believe it because deep down he will want to
he will have to run
if he runs everyone will assume he took the money
jesus that is beautiful
thank you
i had a partner and she fucked me
i will not
it is me
he totally freaked  i have never seen him like this  he is out of his fucking mind
what if he does not run
that means he probably will kill johnnie
okay all right
oh thank god
i am still here
i was so afraid you 
i am sorry corky 
how would it go
hey caesar  you take care of this girl or i find out
done  we go now
unbelievable  can you believe that violet
you should not have to see this  why do not you get out of here  go for a walk
caesar wants me to stay
oh god
mickey  what are you doing here
violet it is gino and johnnie  they were in a car accident
oh my god  was anyone hurt

supernumerary it means better than expected
someone else coming

oh frankie that is this i hear about your brother
he missed three weeks
your own brother you could not send someone else to do it
i did joey two tons and nicky the rake did the deed
why did not you tell me about this
either you are incredibly brave or incredibly stupid which one is it
i guess we are going to find out
you rob an associate of mine a friend and
i do not think it will be a mystery much longer
he is recorded every conversation he is had with you for years
i assume you want something
we have got a lot of people looking for us we would just like to go home
and for my help i would get what
half the tapes
and the other half
i will destroy them when we get back to paris
i only ask so i can call you when the arrangements are made
this plane will take you to canada from there you can fly back to paris
thank you
i do not know
for what
laurant and vincent were in business with zammito
yeah   we just go home
we cannot
no one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison
forget the money we have got bigger problems than the money right now
why not just steal another one

why do i always have to answer the phone
because you are the closest
why is everything an argument with you
raymond grab the tapes    we are leaving

sami tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us

you think it is smart to tell him we are french
that moron
it was an honest mistake ridgeway ridgeroad ridgeway road
fuck you you know i would never go along with something like this
do i
you call being bastaldi's lap dog better
i am not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you are testing mine
we had a chance to walk out of zammito's house
we all agreed to it you had no way of knowing bastaldi was setting us up
we still have to get out of here
this is zero
we have got to be careful not to use our real names while we are in here
good idea

all right knock it off
that is he joking around for    he is been shot

hello jabez  i was just talking to stevens about a little extension on your payment
it seems such an obvious candidature to us all
you throw mighty far jabez  almost into the pigsty
mary  jabez 
well i guess we will not be going to church today
let her be son she will do all right you better get yourself straightened out
i will try hard  i just cannot take it all in
what a nice  and kind girl   who is she 
the new girl  jabez says she is from over the mountain
mary ready first bell's aringing
she will do nothing of the kind she is going to church with me right away
now ma  you just try to set an example for me and keep hold of yourself
me why look here mary stone  i am worried about you that is all
worried about me well you just stop it
that is that
so you have made up your mind to go to the party
you are not angry with me
be sure to let me know if daniel is over there
it is
you have got a smart man mrs stone hang onto him
i have heard some odd things about jabez lately  he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself
mr webster you must not believe all that people say
mr webster  you will help him
there is nothing like a good old country breakfast where is ma
someone to see you dangl
if it is the british minister take him around to the pantry and give him some madeira 
just someone from new hampshire
it is only a short drive mr webster
oh  it is you again what do you want
with the presidential election coming up i thought i could be of some help sir
i would rather see you on the side of the opposition
say that is pretty good young man
mr webster i presume
attorney of record for jabez stone might i ask your name
there is not enough medford rum in the whole of new hampshire to make me sleepy 
talk has never proved that question mr webster  cup for cup  what do you say
not so fast mr scratch produce your evidence  if you have it
foreign and who calls me a foreigner
then i stand on the constitution i demand a trial for my client
very well  you shall have your trial mr webster the case is hardly one for an ordinary jury 
let it be the quick or the dead  so it is an american judge and an american jury
the quick or the dead you have said it  may  the best man win mr webster
my congratulations  as between two gentlemen
that is not it it is  the loneliness mr scratch  the loneliness
the loneliness lonely with all your gold mister stevens that hardly makes sense
i want someone to talk to

bravo  bravo  magnifico
cris you made it  thanks a lot
incidentally you upromiseu you are not going to scratch my car
edward are you sure you know what you are doing
will he be okay
we thought mr lugosi was insured though the screen actors guild
is not he
honey what if i am wrong  what if i just do not have it
ed it was only one review
orson welles was 26 when he made citizen kane  i am already 30
ed you are still young  this is the part of your life when you are usupposedu to be struggling
eddie i do not understand  why are uyouu the most qualified director for the christine jorgensen story
sweetie you will not believe it  i have got the most incredible news
you got the job
huh  oh uh no i did not get the job but something ubetteru happened
better than not getting a job
yeah  i met a movie star  somebody ureally bigu
who  robert taylor
no  a horror movie star
boris karloff
close  the uotheru one
you met basil rathbone
oh the hell with you  i met bela lugosi
boy i cannot even remember the last time he was in a picture
it is a shame  he is such a rest actor and nobody uses him anymore
jesus christ  and you never told me
and what about this socalled barbara character  it is obviously me  i am so embarrassed  this is uouru ulifeu
of course it is  and that is why you should play the part
it is a damn good role
uthat is not the issueu  ugh  how can you act so casual when you are dressed like that
it takes me comfortable
how can you just walk around like that in front of all these people
hong nobody's bothered but you  look around  they could not care less
ed this is not the real world you have surrounded yourself with weirdos
ed who is daniel davis
from today on our lives are different  we will be swimming laps in the same pool jean harlow did
i do not know  it is so much money
who cares  we are on a roll  these are the moments in life you are supposed to grab
look on the bright side  if we miss the rent that is the worst they can do
i am no good
all i wanna do is tell stories  the things i find interesting
ed the landlord called again  he wants his money
tell him bride is in pre production
do not get angry at me  maybe you just need a day job
dolores do not you understand  i am a director now  i made glen or glenda  directing uisu my day job
it was the only way i could get the movie made
who do you think's been paying the rent  who helped type your script and did all your grunt work
i am sorry  what did you want me to say
i wanted you to say no  i wrote the part for my girlfriend dolores
but there's plenty of other parts
like uwhatu
goddamn landlord
i told you this was gonna happen
maybe if you would come to the backers party i would have gotten the money
that is moronic  why would a bit player impress a backer
look how many times can i say i am sorry  i blew it  i thought she was rich
that is a good reason to dump your girlfriend
you are a fucking mess
so what  look we gotta figure out where we are gonna stay
i am going to my mother's
honey you made it i was not sure you got my message
of course i am here  today is the file clerk's big scene
that is right
that is tony mccoy  he is playing lieutenant dick craig
oh really  how much money did he put up
none  but his dad gave me fifty grand
wood productions  the mark of quality
eddie that is umyu motivation
oh  er well you are the file clerk  you are hurrying into the next room when you bump into janet
but that is our relationship  are we good friends or is she just a casual acquaintance
dolores wait
ed it is over  i need a normal life
i am tired of living on the fringe
but you used to say 
pleased to meet you  i am loretta king
i understand you just moved here
so my associate mr marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture
perhaps a small amount of money  how much do one of your motion pictures cost
for this one we need $60000
eddie which dress do you like better
sorry to bother you while we are shooting but the guy who owns the stage needs his money
well then you should pay him should not you
i kinda need it now
what are you looking at me like that for  i already gave you my three hundred
yeah  well i need the other sixtythousand
what other sixtythousand
the other sixtythousand you said you would give me
hey big shot get off your ass  they need a potted palm over in the carl laemmle building

but bela lugosi's in it
mr wood you have bounced your third and final rent check
hmm so you are in the picture business
raising money is tough
would that work
graverobbers from outer space it is umoney in the banku
i do not know this is all a lot to absorb
it is a guaranteed blockbuster
um i understand that this science friction is popular  but do not the big hits always have big stars
yeah well we have got a big star bela lugosi
yes but i have got the last footage he ever shot
what would you give him all the lines for  he is unintelligible
and perfect  cut
perfect  mr wood do you know uanythingu about the art of film production
i like to think so
that cardboard headstone tipped over this graveyard is obviously phony
glad you could fit me in your schedule
could we moovf to table
tor  have you ever thought about becoming an actor
mm not goodlookink enough
i think you are quite handsome
well i think you would be a sensation in pictures
but what bout accent  some people tink i haf too much accent

edvard   i haf question about script my vife greta she read  and she no like
really  was the third act too intense
no  she tink lobo is waste of my time  lobo do not talk

yeah but if you took that crap and put a star in it you would have something
yeah  crap with a star
yeah  ulugosiu

why would lugosi want to be in a sexchange flick
i thought this was gonna be a sex change film
there's still a sexchange 
yeah  five pages right before it ends  the rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters
i do not think he is a schmuck
do not worry  we are not gonna film any of it
i think it is fiftyseven minutes long
um i guess 
good  and one more thing  i think your written directed and starring ed wood credit is a bad idea
but i am proud  i wrote directed and starred in it just like orson welles in citizen kane
georgie that is with the stag footage  you said you were cutting in uestablishing shotsu
where is the ads  the ads are in alabama indiana and missouri  you schmuck it ai not gonna play la

this is our choir director  he is gonna play the young hero

mr wood  uwhat do you think you areu udoingu

ah c'mon  nobody does all that
my goodness you are embarrassing me
eddie i am just a smalltown girl i have never done this before

is he coming
there is one thing left to do excalibur and you must do it perceval leave my wounds i command you
i cannot
when you threw it in what did you see
good day to you sir
move aside this is the king's road and the knights you joined arms against were his very own
that is a wild boast you lack a knight's humility
not a boast sir but a curse  never have i met my match in joust or duel
move aside
yield i have the advantage
fight me from your horse or on foot but fight me your avoidance mocks me
so be it to the death
then make me your champion and i will always fight in your place
but your life and lands are far from here
your deeds set an example for all other knights for your gift ask a gift of me
they miss the battlefield i think we do too
has not merlin mended your wound
at last
merlin will i live  i was dreaming
of merlin
he can be no other
who is merlin
whose son am i
you saved me from the arrow
but not from your destiny
i want to thank you
merlin help me i need your help i do not know how
it is just that i have no experience and no men to speak of how can i
how where
in the great book
then as knight to knight i can offer you mercy
a king must marry after all
who will it be put your mind to it then
so you were stealing their honey they should have killed you
come now so much anger for such a little crime are you sure there is nothing else troubling you
excalibur is it true
the knights of galys approach the camp it would be politic
where hides evil then in my kingdom
merlin tell me now that guenevere is returned to me
what  the greatest they blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword
that is my destiny i have a destiny too
i must do it myself i must kill them both lancelot and guenevere will you ride with me merlin
quiet you will wake the men and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives
i know i have heard noises and echoes through the stones
but i am here
rise mordred
i have come to claim what is mine father
the very spear that pierced the side of christ as he died on the cross
i will muster a great force of knights and i will return to fight for what is mine
i left it in the tent sir
sir kay needed a sword his was stolen i saw excalibur and i took it
you freed it son
he is the mightiest and fairest of knights
but i have to leave tomorrow the forests are thick with rebels invaders plunder our shores
and damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued
i did not know leondegrance had a daughter
no i think it is better if you just stay here to heal at least a week
i am going
he must stay for the feasting days of our wedding and tell his deeds himself
i will ride with sir kay lancelot rest here
do not start a war on my wedding day
the queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf
and you cannot love me
who does it serve
because you and the land are one
i am wasting away and i cannot die and i cannot live
i am a fighting man and i am married to the quest that is enough
and there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you
yes i would swear my love to you
the law forbids it
why did not he kill us
the king without his sword the land without a king
just a man a knight in the king's service
very well climb up
i will run
listen boy it is more than twenty days from here
you left your husband's side you left your brother's wedding
is that mandrake lord merlin
it is
no no of course not you are young
i am not jealous
a lovestruck page
i showed you all my conjuring tricks
the deepest secrets the forbidden formulas
merlin the powers of summoning the true name of the charms of doing and undoing show me
what do you want you must desire it for me to weave it
you provoke me merlin
i am the cloudburst that quenches the flames
i am the desert where water disappears
i am the sea which covers the desert forever under its weight
it is done a truce we meet at the river
i should butcher all and every one of them merlin what is this wagging of tongues
i swear it by excalibur and the holy
what issues from your lust will be mine swear it again
the oath you did not say
it is not for you uther hearth and home wife and child
you know you could'a run an ad in the personals
sensual blind chick seeks threeton rockhard heman for deep spiritual relationship
i would not know anything about that
i do not think she is real big on hate
such a sad face you know sometimes being different is not a bad thing
how would you know it was me
i am not really dressed for a party
relax it is casual

it is easy for you to be patient
uwhere is reedu
your tissue your organs your entire biophysical structure is changing every system is still functioning somehow 
and they are changing into
i do not really know  a compound organicmetallic alloy  stronger than titanium or carbon steel  harder than diamonds 
like the shields reed said would protect us  how long
at this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks 
butthis diseaseis progressive degenerative
victor's right  johnny get to the command center  close the shields
he is not responsive 
now what is up with ithati
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna
oh you dawg you  better not be my nurse

material made from selfregulating unstable molecules  i have been working on a formula for this
feeling better
yes thanks
that is good  that is uhgood
you are uhappyu for me and victor
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship 
uh sue  i ucannotu
what  what do you mean you 
it has to be the cloud  it is fundamentally altered our dna
sue  your clothes  lose them
how come ben cannot turn it on and off like us
that is what we are here to find out
you should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better 
anger  rage  frustration
okay  is there any way to duplicate that feeling  some memory or
i mean uyouu broke up with umeu right
are you kidding
reed  i was ready for the next step you were not ergo i walked
i think it was a little more complicated than 
if we can build a machine to recreate the storm we can reverse the polarity 
and reverse the mutations 
but uwe areu the focus right reed ureedu
of course  of course
and you sure you can control this thing  last time did not work out so well
reed  how close are we to a cure
do not let victor push you into making a mistake 
he was going to take away all my data equipment 
which is why i am working utwentyu hours a day checking every variable 
every variable but uyourselfu  you do not eat sleep  you cannot live in your head like 
i could get ben to tap into the baxter's main power to generate enough voltage 
remember our first date here  god i was so nervous
you know i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late
when i walked out i waited utenu uminutesu outside your door  ten waiting for you to come find me
why did not you say something
i canmake it work
reed stop you need to rest your 
the poweri needmore powerto controlthe storm 
sue i need some of that anger rage frustration 
i found a broken gasket from space 
it is just business
surprised i agreed to reed's proposal
i understand the ibusinessi reasons
what are you doing
raising the shields
that is going on
victor i am sorry i 
victor your scar 
i told you i am fine  it is uyouu i am worried about
you said it was urgent
he is working round the clock  but the data needs to be tested analyzed before 
please do not make this personal 
oh i think you already have
reed's gonna fix me up 
that would not interest you
where is tyler
the first rule of project 
he was killed in action
no  look at you  you are you are running around in ski masks exploding things
i need to know where tyler is  cannot you help me
sir you are disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior
there's no one else here
i am sorry i have not the faintest idea what you are talking about
you are a moron
this was a support group for men with testicular cancer  the big moosie slobbering all over me was bob
we are still men
cornelius  how are you
bob  i am okay  how are you
better than i have ever been in my life
no  i found something new
really that is that
and the second rule about it is you are not supposed to talk about it and the third rule
bob bob i am a member
you are
that is a fucking great man  fucking great congratulations
i am going to need you outoftown a little more this week  we have got some redflags to cover
it must have been tuesday  he was wearing his cornflowerblue tie
you want me to deprioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade
you need to make these your primary action items
he was full of pep  must have had his grande latte enema
after fight club everything else in your life gets the volume turned down  you can deal with anything
is that your blood
i must have left the original in the copy machine
you do not get paid to abuse the copy machine
abuse the copy machine  there's an image
we need to talk
okay  where to begin  with your constant absenteeism  with your unpresentable appearance  you are up for review
no i was not aware
i am jack's cold sweat
does this sound strange to you
yes  it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride do you know what that means
what does that mean
it means it was homemade
who do you think could have done this
no you cannot die of insomnia
maybe i died already  look at my face
you need to lighten up
cannot you give me something
redandblue tuinal lipstickred seconals
i am in pain
and i saw you practicing this
practicing what
telling me off  is it going as well as you hoped    mr taylor
i will expose you
why are you doing this
it is cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee
these are my groups  i was here first  i have been coming for a year
a year  how would you manage that
i i do not know  i guess when people think you are dying they really listen instead
look i cannot cry with a faker present
candystripe a cancer ward  it is not my problem
we will split up the week  you can have lymphoma tuberculosis and 
you take tuberculosis  my smoking does not go over at all
i think testicular cancer should be no contest
well technically i have more of a right to be there than you  you still have your balls
you are kidding
i will take the parasites
you cannot have both parasites  you can take blood parasites 
i want brain parasites
okay  i will take blood parasites and organic brain dementia 
i want that
you cannot have the whole brain
so far you have four and i only have two
so we each have three  that is six what about the seventh day  i want ascending bowel cancer
that is your favorite too  tried to slip it by me eh
looks like this is goodbye
um marla should we maybe exchange numbers
should we
in case we want to switch nights
how did you find me
the forwarding number  i have not seen you at any support groups
that is the idea  we split them
you have not been going to yours
it is for men
like testicular cancer
look this is a bad time
i have been going to debtor's anonymous  you want to see some truly fucked up people
picture yourself watching marla singer throw herself around her crummy apartment
this is not a forreal suicide thing this is probably one of those cryfor help things
this could go on for hours
so you are staying in tonight
except for their humping tyler and marla were never in the same room
i got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar
like sex crime victims underwear insideout bound with electrical tape

there's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation
he is an italian
for you she is beautiful  for me there is only my wife
some guys from ninth avenue jumped fanucci today slit his throat from ear to ear

within the compound will be fine
i was supposed to take the children to new england next week
that is off now
how long does this go on
i do not know  i am sorry kay
am i a prisoner
he is not the same as when i met him
if you told michael what i have told you today i am a dead man
he does not want my help any more he does not need it
we do not know that is true he never said that
talk to him  tell him how you feel
why did not someone tell me
will you tell him
she took a flight to san francisco we figure she is going to connect to new hampshire her parents' place
me too tom
i am sorry of course you know that
twothirty  that gives me time to see my boy
tom is not going to sit in with us johnny  he only handles specific areas of the family business  tom
if you need anything just
but your people neri rocco you do not think
but if you are wrong
did the boy get something from me for christmas
i took care of it
what was it so i will know
my information is that fredo thought it was a kidnapping  roth assured him nothing would happen to you
they can come in now
go on tell me
was it a boy or a girl
mike at three and a half
what is it cannot you give me straight answers anymore
it was a boy
and kayshe is all right
she took the senate investigation worse
does she blame it on me  the baby
he says he does not know anything and i believe him  roth played this one beautifully
sit down tom  have you heard about our friend and partner mr hyman roth
they will not take him not for a million not for ten million
his medical condition is reported as &quotterminal&quot
he is been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years
that plane goes to miami
i want it met
mike it is impossible  he will be met by the internal revenue the customs service and half the fbi
i do not like it when you use the word impossible nothing is impossible
are you so hungry for traitors do you want to find them everywhere
why do you hurt me michael  i have always been loyal to you
fifteen percent skim
it might show
that is up
al as far as you are concerned i am the don
i think i prefer to see my client privately
the room has a bug in it
everything is going to be okay frankie do not worry
did my brother go back
yeah but do not worry
he is ten times tougher than me my brother  he is oldfashioned
you are right
do not worry about anything frankie fiveangels
and the tape will be running
no one can trace anything to me i pride myself on that
do you gamble
a little that is so thought provoking about that
do you owe markers
there's thirty grand worth of paid off markers  i never owed that much
our mistake  but what does it matter it was our money  we do not even expect thanks
you paid off thirty grand i never owed
we will keep it quiet the people who know are trustworthythe committee need not find out
and that is the price of their not finding out
senator my client would like to read a statement for the record
mr hagen would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand
yes sir  his name is vincenzo pentangeli
is he related to the witness
senator kane
this meeting is adjourned
this committee owes an apology
i am sorry mrs corleone  we are not to let you through
i am going to the market
if you could just give us a list we will pick up anything you want
whose orders are these
anthony daddy's busy
how is the baby
sleeping inside me
does it feel like a boy
i had no idea
why do not you sit down
why too late
tell me michael  what really happened with pentangeli
his brother came to help him
i did not even know he had a brother and where is he now
on a plane back to sicily
i will bring the children up now they want to say goodbye
kay i told you
goodbye michael
if that is what it takes then yes i will
at this moment i feel no love for you at all  i never thought that could happen but it has
we will go back tonight  bring the children
are you klingman
who's asking
where can we talk
who do you think you are talking to
you said you were klingman
you do not come in here talk to an owner in las vegas like that
you missed my point you are no longer an owner
it is michael  how are you mom
i am alright  will you stay home for awhile
there are still things i have to do
you talk about the baby  she can have another baby
no i meant lose his family
your family  how can you ever lose your family
sit down this is almost over  you follow the baseball games
you are a considerate young man
you are a great man mr roth i have much to learn from you
however i can help you
the rosato brothers have performed services for you in the past i understand that they are under your protection
nothing is more important
pentangeli is a dead man do you object
it is always bad for business but you have no choice
then it is done  i must choose his replacement it cannot be rosato
i still do not speak spanish michael
i would not consider anyone else
terrible  i would give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting
who had frankie pantangeli killed
whythe rosato brothers
this is it  we think it makes vegas look like the corner crap game
very impressive
you know my lawyer tom hagen johnny ola
i just left our friend in miami
how is his health
not good
is there anything i can do anything i can send
let him gamble
that is a complete falsehood
mr corleone do you have any hotel interests in the state of arizona or any gambling interests in that state
i do not
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york
i know
when do we talk
sure pete clemenza died of a heart attack but the rosato brothers gave it to him
you were unfair with them
says who
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died and then you took over and welched
clemenza promised them nothing he hated the sonsuvbitches
your family still carries the name corleone and you will run it like a corleone
the rosatos are running crazy taking hostages spitting in my face because they are backed by the jew in miami
no  there are things that i have planned with hyman roth  i do not want them disturbed
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood
frankie you know my father respected roth did business with him
don corleone i wish you let me know you was coming  we could have prepared something for you
i did not want you to know i was coming  you heard what happened in my home
i want you to help me take my revenge
michael anything  what is it i can do for you
i want you to settle these troubles with the rosato brothers
i was just going to contact you michael we just had a 'sitdowng  in fact i just come from there
i want you to settle on their terms
mike i do not understand  do not ask me to do that
i know
then why do you want me to lay down to them
frankie roth tried to have me killed  i am sure it was him but i do not know yet why
my lawyer tom hagen  he arranged this all through your man turnbull
i thought we would meet alone
i trust these men with my life they are my right arms i cannot insult them by sending them away
we are all part of the same hypocrisy senator  but never think it applies to my family
they are still on the property maybe you better stay inside
we will try
on the phone
rosato where is your brother
he do not want to talk
we worked it all out beforehand
are we going to eat or what
sure on me  i got diner's club
forget it i am suddenly without an appetite  you are making big trouble carmine
you were not straight with us frankie what else could we do
we could have talked first saved a lot of running around
you was not listening you did not want to talk
pari persu what the fuck is pari persu
my lawyer went over this beforehand
what assurances do i have that there will be no more kidnapping no more hits
the same assurance we got from you
what if i say shove it
then carmine fucillo and tony blue derosa will need to be fitted for slabs
you want a war
we got friends in the commission
i am talking about italians

baby goddamn scared me to death
they just wanted to say hello
let's head to the gate and work our way back
that is a lot of ground to cover
it is romantic down here
oh yeah  very
you know on our honeymoon we should go scuba diving
 if nothing's wrong why are we stopping here
 electrical connection malfunctioning
you sound like houston mission control  what the hell does it mean
that we swim
swim where  out there  oh no forget it not me  you go i am staying
michael the sub's dead
yeah and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle
and leave me down here
make up your mind
what mind  if i had a mind i would never have let you talk me into this
i talked you into this
i would have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber
you would would not you  i would end up whale shit you would not care
you all right
i think so  i am not sure are you
how the hell did it get in here
god they are horrible  i hate them  did you see its eyes  how black they are  the look in them
do not think about it  it is over
after what happened to us
i know i can capture it
oh yeah  really nice  who's your designer  sassoon shark
fine piece of engineering
should protect you a little from the compression  if that thing gets ahold of you
would not this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime
it is easier to lure sharks at night
you amaze me  i am more scared than you
i can use a shot of what he is got
sounds wonderful
you want me to stay
get some sleep  and tell sean i am sorry
how is your patient
recovering nicely
mmmm you smell good
you do not
they said you would be here
that is up
i want to make sure the white is getting enough flow  would you do that for me
no we will go through here
 mean through the tubes
yes  it is faster
i am not going to walk through that shark arcade
they are not going to hurt you they are encased in plastic
calvin wants me to move the white for tomorrow
 he ought to put him in here
it is too soon to move him
so tell calvin
i did  he wants it on exhibit
michael take deep breaths
i have to get out of here
come on
i cannot take water kathryn
put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will 
that is the big deal  a shark got overman and we got the shark
that is just it michael  we do not
what do you mean we do not
this tooth is from another shark a shark that could be 30 feet long
what did you just say before about water flowing through them
that is why they are always moving they have to have it
somebody better get down there
come on
how is he
couple of fractures lacerations they say he is gonna be all right
that is right
michael you are not going down there
i am  you are not
but you 
michael you do not have to go down there
i want that shark kathryn
you do not have to prove anything
are you okay
go where
on the telly  we are to film him for the evening news
nobody told me
i just did  can you make them do tricks
they are not tricks  they are behavior patterns
fine  have them do some
i do not know  they are nervous and skittish right now
okay now  have flipper flip or something
it is no use  they will not come into the lagoon
well then can you have them jump to the camera over here
wait a minute  these are not kangaroos mr hutton  they are dolphins
i thought they were clever
i can have them walk backwards
no no  that will not do
unhappy combination  most likely one's inside the other
i think we can capture it  i would like to try
you can get killed
i have handled sharks before bigger than this one
it will chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes
calvin i insist i be allowed to capture it
three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known
i will
well then i am going to film it
like hell
i want that shark alive
you look like an orange worm
shark bait  draws them over for closeups
lunch for whitey  something to munch on in case things get dicey
we are taking that shark alive
let's hope he knows that
i insist you get rid of that bomb
afraid i cannot do that
how is sleeping beauty
still sleeping
kiss him maybe he will turn into a frog
should be coming out of it soon
could be a new dance  walking the shark
thanks for helping
not at all
why are you
i like it when they wake up
so do i  but for different reasons
you were quite daring in capturing him  very skillful indeed
skillful  i missed my first shot
some miss all their shots
somebody could have gotten hurt
that is what life is doctor full of chances to hurt yourself or somebody else
i think that you and i are natural enemies
hello  i think his nap's over
get ready to go
believe me i am
well doctor  you have got your shark
i have heard of a white that big in australia
he is big as a bloody bus
we can assume he is back in the water intake passage
she mister hutton
a piece of pie on sunday
i think they will come out now
they still seem nervous
he is a young one
when did this happen
i knew it  it is my fault  we moved it too soon
do not blame yourself
no one's ever done it before it was a good try
not good enough
he is missing
kelly could you look after sean for a while  show him around for me

last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring  gang of kids were using slugs in the pacman games
big bust  he confiscate their water pistols

yeah he will really go for that
she still talking to you
no really  i have never met anyone like her before  this is it
yeah right  that is what you said about janet and beth and barbara 
we will shoot this with an 18 boys
that bugger moves fast
give me a 400foot magazine  we may be down there for a while
i would not mind going down with her
you want to show this
you work in the insurance department
where do you live
it is only majestic from here when you get closer you see it for what it really is
my assistants i presume
you look like brothers
yes  we do
have you worked here long
fine  terrible
heralds of a new age  does that sound immodest
preliminary investigations may already be underway
yours is a very powerful and important firm  it has a lot at stake
i have read your stories  they are fantastic
i do not know what you could have read
just what you have published
 in magazines nobody reads
i read the one about the penal colony
did you
gabriela was right  it is easier for me to understand suicide i am a practicing suicide
these strange stories you write  they come naturally do they
that would be even worse  it would be a compromise
you work in the cemetery
a man must eat   and drink
 oh yes determination runs in the family
there is uoneu thing i would like you to tell me
i am trying to find things out myself  that is the whole point
i was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day  and i found this
an empty tomb
will you do me a favor then
what an extraordinary request
it is my last and final one
then its authority is in doubt
a true friend would do it
the keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the erlanger claim
i gave it to him yesterday
you did not give it to umeu
no i left it in his office
did you see him
burgel i thought it would be easier as long as i was passing 
but ui amu the messenger  an error like this damages my credibility
good morning   or should i say good afternoon
say what you like  no one pays the least attention
you are just doing your job
it is what i am paid to do
you are detestable
you wanted to see me sir
to do my work well i have little time for 
you must make the time  where do you go off to in the lunch hour
well i 
i understand you fancy yourself an author
in a small way
excuse me sir  i understand you have eduard rabangs file
i see  it is just the erlanger claim then
the uorlacu claim
i am kafka  i work upstairs in accident 
i know
you are a friend of eduard rabangs
why would you suppose so
oh  well i thought he once mentioned 
i am sorry but i just wondered 
hello again
i have never seen you here before
he would have  you were his best friend  a better friend than me
that is funny
how long were you and eduard 
no i do not  i am amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all
eduard did not see it as something that needed bearing
the police would know the difference would not they
do you think people in the new town care what happens over here  this will always be the ghetto
he was not robbed  he was identified by his wallet
and you believe everything the authorities tell you
there are some people i would like you to meet  can you come to the musil district at eight o'clock
you almost married recently did not you
last year  i  it was broken off
eduard wanted to marry me
 i do not know the musil district
ah  we are back to the authorities you spoke of
i nominated you as a possible candidate  you were eduard's good friend  he read me some of your work
the day he died eduard was called up to the castle  did you know that
and you still maintain  what that he was murdered
you are shocked at the thought of eduard tossing a bomb through a window
i have no right to be i know  my experience with real life  is practically nil
when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day it is liable to create a false impression
my only concern is the human tribunal  is not it yours
i am collecting eduard's things if there's anything you want take it or i will give it to charity
burgel gave me this  what does it mean
burgel  i did not leave it with him
why were you given notice
they are not obliged to tell
you do not believe that
burgel hated eduard  and me  i am sure he knew about us  and i am sure it drove him mad
burgel does not like anybody
he used to like me  very much more than i liked him
now you are saying eduard was lured there
how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records
i have heard of it happening
gabriela  you did get away
i knew you walked this way to work  i wanted to find you before they did
only two steps back  even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that
kafka  is that your real name
yes  yes of course  why would not it be
when was the last time you saw mr raban
wednesday  we left the office together
did you go anywhere afterwards  to have a drink perhaps
no we said goodbye outside the building  he went off as usual toward his house
your office is the workmengs 
 accident and compensation association
where you have been employed for seven years
eight  and seven months
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of  pills and so forth
well  other departments are yes
would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close
yes  since he came to the office almost three years ago we have been quite good friends  how was eduard 
he was found in the river  could he swim
i do not know
was he depressed
no  he did not seem to be  do you think he drowned himself
grown men do not normally fall into the river do they
no i suppose not
he might have had a drink or two despite what you think
can i ask  how you found me
his landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to
i do not think he really had any he had no family either
he was not a lonely man though
what makes you think so
i will bear that in mind
that is been noted  but where does it lead us  unless you have something more to add
maybe it is true then what she said
what did she say
do you
i did not realize you would been here that long
 i was just trying to finish some work
that is the matter with you
i cannot make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
 just doing our job
still we are probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings
 why take me into your confidence
that is umadu
why are you so aggressively unimaginative  eduard is no longer the only casualty
accident and compensation  no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises
may i ask where your two warders are
raban  that will be nearly at the back of the alphabet
i am overworked as it is  raban did you say
wait a minute  raban  where have i heard that name
if it was accounts you wanted why did you ask for employees
what good are records if they are not open for public inspection
these laws have been with us for centuries  how can you doubt them
where do our records go to in the castle
we are a medical firm are not we they go to the medical records section
he cannot sit still  just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one
you look tired
women are all you have on your mind
they keep switching us from department to department  he does not mind because he cannot sit still
we used to be in the supply section carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them
it is not our fault  we are naturally nervous
we have been together too long  his personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa
this is filed incorrectly
we could go back to the office explain ourselves to the chief clerk
they would drive us away  that kafka's made things very hot for us
i understand he was wounded in the lung
it does not matter  it is too late for all of us
then that is the place for us
is not this jack groppi's place
yeah  but he ai not here now
know where he is
it is obvious that the girl does not want to accompany you is not it
look fellathis is private
whether she wants to or notshe is not going
we went down to chinatown but they do not have any
well i do not know if we want to buy all $40 worth
that means it is good
no all we got is $40

you have got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason i would like to hear what it is
put the sensenet police on it the matrix is their turf
my days of punching deck are over for you or anybody else

who's running the show armitage this a government sting
i will think you will find everything in working order molly's just having a little fun
thanks but i was enjoying that dependency
why would you do it armitage
the disturbance in cyberspace it is an ai
anything rated higher than a pc's got a hardwired suicide switch it will self destruct
i have heard about rogue ai's but there's only one guy who actually went up against one
dixie mccoy
right best cowboy that ever punched deck the old man taught me most of what i know
i have arranged for him to work with us
that is gonna be tough because dixie mccoy's dead the ai flatlined him
i know  you ever work with ghosts case
and then
then we rendezvous with the final member of our team for now that is all you need to know
you ran without us
i cannot tell a lie sorry
sorry bullshit we have not even begun and you are already jeopardising this operation
that is this
could be your ai's calling card
did you trace it
fried air tram in the process not to mention half my gear
prepping your trip
that could work but the timing will be a bitch
yeah well it is working
let's hope she does not expect me to swim upstream
that is lord frederick tessier owns most of freeside wintermute's mainframe is centred in the royal family's villa
that is nice but we cannot dodge this kind of heat for long
okay the floor plans will be a piece of cake
then once she is in you can guide her straight to the mainframe
as long as you cooperate  i want it now armitage
what are you talking about
you have got your orders
you find out in exactly two hours and fortyfive minutes
an odd selection mr case
i prefer distrusting you it will keep us honest
honesty almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil
are you even really alive
tell me the words
the words
that is inside me wintermute what did your doctors do to me
ah herr case and how is the artiste tonight
i saw your girl yesterday
i do not have a girl

how are we doing
that ai of your's got the whole matrix humming sticks out like a spider in a web

the run is tomorrow night dixie can you crack its ice pattern
where the hell have you been

you did not think we would let you go alone
kincaid  we should find the others first
that is happening
i am glad things have worked out for you
i think new york was just what i needed  so many people  i never feel alone
the city that never sleeps  so what will you do now
i do not know  i am busy with school new friends  but i will never forget the old ones
to old friends  and your new dreams
it was great seeing you again  i am glad you dropped by
do you stillsee each other
you pulled me in somehow did not you
that man in my dreams  he is real is not he
you like gymnastics
i was on the team at school  i was never very good though
we are not always as good at things as we would like
i have not been able to do that since i was a little girl
you did it the other night
that was different
joey needs us  i can feel him
that is that
kristen can you pull us out
they sedated me  we are stuck here till it wears off
are you okay
he is gone  it is over  please do not die nancy  please
hi sweet stuff  good news
cannot be good news coming from you
the dispensary  i am talking clean pharmaceutical high  a night at club meth
what are these beauty marks
those are ancient history
oh yeah  well if you are ever in the mood for a history lesson i am your teacher understand
stay out of my face or i will go straight to max
now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you
the whole wing's devoted ot this program  that is your office
a little basic but nice
this is phillip  we call him the walker
max where is kristen
putting in soem late hours i see  if you are trying for ot you are in the wrong place
i just wanted to be here for the kids how are they
you need me i will be here all night
i do not know
you got five minutes
nothing like a little cheery news to start the day
say listen doc  i got a new theory about all these suicides
do not hold back on us max  we need all the help we can get
fucked up chromosomes man  think about it  their parents all dropped acid in the sixties
it beats dr simm's theory  she thinks it is nothing but sex drugs and rock & roll
well if it is not my little girl come to visit her daddy
fred krueger's dead  you always had a little trouble understanding that princess
crossed over
tell me about the kids
you will get to meet them all tomorrow they aresurvivors  in a way  all severely sleep disordered  insomnia narcolepsy bedwetting
i would not be so sure they have not
i have had some experience with pattern nightmares
so i have been told  practically an obsession of your
call it a passion  i have got to get going
ms thompson
call me nancy
only if you call me neil  what was that nursery rhyme all about
you are late
did not get much sleep
this is nice
never been here before
must have opened while i was away at school
most authentic mexican food in springwood which is not saying much  your parents still live around here
my father an iwell the family just seemed to fall apart
sounds like a rough time
it was  neil do you believe in other realities
i have been to pittsburgh  does that count
what if i told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams
that is a new one  is that what they are teaching now at stanford
that is what i know
the nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems
all right  then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being
with hypnocyl
that is right
you want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers
just until we get things under control
dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with  you have no business taking it yourself
i used to be like them neil  i know what they are going through
so do i
do you  you told me they are survivorsand they are  but how much longer they survive is up to us
i cannot believe i just did that
do you think we can get the hypnocyl in by tomorrow
to who
does not matter
then maybe you are ready
for what
the truth
try me
only if you are willing to put aside everything you have learned and trust me can you do that
you sound like peter pan
remember  open mind
we can try again
what are we going to do
do not you think i know that  i do not have any choice
bullshit  getting yourself killed will not do the kids any good  besides we do have a choice
assuming your mysterious nun in right
i have heard crazier things this week
all right  whoever she is i will admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do
the question is what happened to freddy's body
they burned him to death in his boiler room but they were smart enough to hide the remains
who would know where they were hidden
neil it is no use  you saw how he is
your dreams
what would you do take the scenic route
okay straight talk only in here
what about kristen
and you will not make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are
and what are they
we will begin sedation tonight  starting with him
you cannot  they will be defenseless against their dreams
that is precisely what they need  some uninterrupted rem sleep to release all this negative energy
how do we get in
we have got work to do
what are you talking about
somebody else is out here
sciencei suppose
a sad choice
there are times when it does not offer much comfort  i have seen you before  sister
mary helena
you do volunteer work at the hospital
my god
you said something beforeabout laying him to rest
how is he
cooling down
if he continues having these outbursts i will have to have him isolated permanently
what did you think
frankly i do not understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro
elizabeth i am prescribing hypnocyl  it is a dream suppressant
i know what it is  i just cannot believe what i am hearing  what has she talked you into
nothing  they are my patients  it is my decision  i want the dreams stopped until we get some answers
i will not allow it
i am sorry neil  you brought this on yourself
for god's sake elizabethjust try to help the kids will you  listen to them
i am will stanton and umi have had a little accident as you can see
okay you are attacked by the bog demon go ahead

and the one driving the other car
glenn michaels
oh is this adele
yes it is
i want to speak with you please
you were ibothi in the trunk  together
the fbi did not tell you i was with them
they did not itelli me anything they asked questions
but you know what i am talking about do not you  about glenn do not you and the second car
he did not hurt you or anything did he
you mean did he try to jump me  no but he was kind of talkative
you did not visit him in prison
he did not want me to
but you spoke to him on the phone
he would call every once in a while
he called the day he escaped
he did  i do not remember  did he say about me  in the trunk
he said he wished the two of you could start over live a normal life
huh  problem is jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks  it is all he is ever done
ask him his name
you are good
oh  uhhuh
you did work for emil right
yeah i was emil's boxjumper for almost four years
you were his what his box
you say you perform in the miami area
i am not dressed
wait in the hall  i have to get dressed
go away or i will call the police
it is richard ripley
i bet that is all the hacks they send out  otherwise nobody's left to mind the store
where in the hell are we
that is the turnpike up there  glenngs waiting with the other car
jesus christ what were you doing in there
wait a minute  let me have your raincoat  somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes
why you brought glenn into this i will never know
i do not know why but every time he opens his mouth i want to punch him out
i want to talk to her again that is all  see what would happen under you know normal circumstances
i am just saying she was not scared
you are just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you
i have been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months  soak the prison off me
there's some lilac oil you want some a vanilla candle under the sink
i know exactly what you mean  it is just a feeling  you know i could go for some wine tonight
there's a store around the corner i will be right back
they pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want nobody will know you
i was not feeling my best that day i would just drawn thirty to life
paper says there's ten grand each on you chino and lulu
say anything in there about karen sisco
just that she got away
yeah but what happened after she drove off with glenn
think this old guy is her boyfriend it is the only picture she carries
chino's gonna wanna talk to me
so call her up  tell her do not talk to any cubans
her phone's probably tapped
nice disguise
i am a tourist
you at least bring the gun
i guess adele's in good hands
sure looks that way
let's go to detroit
i been thinking if i was glenn i was up there to take down the ripper where would i go
well first off if you were glenn you would not be thinking
remember snoopy miller his old pal from lompoc
whatta you think
i think glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner
is that snoopy  in the purple doo rag
i think she is after glenn  the girl still with you
they do not stay the night jack 'less you pay for it
you tell your sister about it
just hung up
how long you talk to her
two hours
how long were you with the girl
fortyfive minutes
now that is a really big house
jesus look at that wall  place almost looks like a prison
they put a gun on you you will go back
it took you what seven hours to buy a pair of shoes
and she saw you
yes she did
so how is that work a wanted felon socializing with a us marshal
you know how i felt about her
did you give her a jump  if you did i might begin to understand where your head's at
it was not about getting laid  i just wanted to know what might have happened if things were different
you find out
they want to go tonight before glenn gets in any trouble opens his big mouth
you know they gonna set us up
i get that feeling yeah
half for doing what
getting me out of glades for starters
there's still time take me up on my offer
you ever wear one of these
i do not ski
they found the safe
you remember buddy do not you richard

that part in the movie where they get shot  warren beatty and i cannot think of her name
faye dunaway
yeah i liked her in that movie about tv
inetworki  yeah she was good

another one faye dunaway was in i liked ithree days of the condori
i mean romantically
how would you get this number
who was it answered the phone
none of your business

how do we do that
let's see  you could come on by my dad's place drop 'em off
you will not do that
why not
my dad's retired  he was a private investigator  forty years  i used to work for him
i can just picture that a cute girl like you following slipandfall and whiplash cheaters

those guys bother you
you like bourbon

is that how you think of yourself
what as a sales rep
a girl
i do not have a problem with it
i like your hair  and that suit
i had one just like it  well it was the same idea but i had to get rid of it
you did
it smelled

who you talking to studs  me or buddy  i cannot tell you got those shades on
you guys come on this is too heavy
i guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights
detroit  snoopy miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash
ever seen an uncut diamond studs they look like plain old rocks
so  that is your point
my point is that is probably what you are gonna end up with
oh hey studs  we thought you were somebody else
studs  man i have not heard that since lompoc  that is going on
take your sunglasses off
wait in the car
in the trunk
were not you expecting us
what happened to your shades  someone finally step on 'em

you want to sue wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown
i misplaced an important complaint that is their story want to hear mine
my lover and i
your lover
i buy that
they sabotaged me
i knew you were going to say that i do not buy it and i do not see a case
look i know i have a case if you do not want to take it for personal reasons
thanks for your time
beckett i am sorry about that is happened to you it is a fucking kick in the head
find a lawyer
i am a lawyer how is your baby

how did they find out
they did not fire her
there is no relevant precedent
we are friends of beckett's
beckett you seem better energized more alive
i am a law suit
not bad
get it
what do you want
beer  we need to go over your q and a
excuse me i am having a goddamn party is that allright with you
sure it is fine
no we have to do it but later allright
thank you for sharing that with me joe
then we establish how wheeler's boys recruited you after law school
what have you prayed for
for a healthy baby for lisa to make it through the delivery for the phillies to get into the playoffs
there's a possibility i will not be around for the end of this trial
i have considered that
what happens
i know a good probate lawyer
i will look over the q and a
particularly charles
what impressed you about him
he was the kind of person i thought i wanted to be
a regular allamerican guy
i suppose you could say that
except you were gay
i still am
in the years you worked at wyant wheeler did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay
no i did not
are you a good lawyer
i am an excellent lawyer
excellent work joe i thank you
i better get home lisa and i are having some friends over
thanks for coming by
what can i do
you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had an adventurous spirit is that correct
something like that
do you take risks
in my work yes calculated risks you have to
in general do you take risks in other areas of your life
not unnecessary ones
what kind of movies do they show there
gay movies
when approximately what year did this event take place
it is impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv
but you uwereu having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985
that happened once people were not talking about aids then the way we are now or safe sex
that is unotu correct i never lied about it
some do i did not
as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality is that right
you could have infected him is not that right
you have testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with correct
do you have any lesions on your face at this time
by the time i was fired there were four lesions on my face much bigger
answer the question please
no i cannot really see it
andy this is a nice surprise how are you hon
i am fine
that is dr gillman say
where is dad
were you recently promoted
yes i am now in charge of the paralegal department
ms burton you are black
is that a question
in what way
well one time mr wheeler's secretary lydia told me mr wheeler had a problem with my earrings
what did you say
i said my earrings uareu american they are africanamerican
you had contact with someone who has aids and you are worried
we are going to draw blood
why are we going to do that
joe i do not care a whit about your private life
a homosexual encounter
get real
unprotected sex with a prostitute
uh no not really
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990 is that correct
but andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit
that is correct
were you pleased with his work
we won
did that thrill impress and overwhelm you
andy before we begin i would just like to say everyone in this room is your friend
let's put it this way andy your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure
and i hate to rush you out of here but
but he is got lots of other people's lives to ruin
sometimes it seems like society is urunu by these kinds of people
what kind of people
whoa whoa whoa whoa do you think  you think ui amu   gay
are not you
that is the matter with you do i look gay to you
do i look gay to you relax
relax i ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you
do not you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys
fuck you you want to kick my ass you want to try  asshole
you are the asshole buddy
you load the film  no on this side or this side do not move the baby
you have a problem with gays joe
how many gays do you know
since when
probably since she was born
allright i admit it i am prejudiced i do not want to work with a homosexual you got me
have you changed your aftershave
two men making love  now tell me again uwhyu is that disgusting
did i ever tell you i hate costume parties
i will see you in an hour max
why did not you cross at the crosswalk
now that you mention it
whoa whoa  what do you expect them to say you are alan dershowitz
anywhere from two weeks to several months
going on like
yeah but we took care of him
how did you do that
you taught him a lesson
yes we did
usheu did not try to conceal it
so you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise is that correct
attorney for the plaintiff
i will take that under consideration your honor
reinstatement at full salary back pay covering the period of unemployment and
in this courtroom mr miller justice is blind to matters of race creed color religion and sexual orientation
with all due respect your honor we do not live in this courtroom do we
let's continue
this would be a good time to break for the day
it is good to be king hey charles
andrew brought aids into our offices into our mengs room he brought aids to our annual goddamn family picnic
you will be sorry beckett
 to suit their personal desires and the rest of us have to live with it
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to  what is it bob

perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them
i tell you this station will be operational as planned
the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation

i want to talk to you
off the record no cameras
please you owe me
you owe my mother
your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case somebody was gonna write a book about it
he was convicted in a court of law your testimony put him away it does not matter what i think
during the trial you did all those stories about me you called me a liar
i think you falsely identified him yes
have you talked to cotton
many times
has his story changed
he was drunk that night he left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him
she was never attacked i think she made it all up
why would she lie about it
what if she did it what if sidney killed casey and steve
and why would she do that
why would sidney want to be with steve she has her own bubblebutt boyfriend billy
you are evil
where do you get this shit
aha randy you gave yourself away are you calling from work tatum's on her way over
do you like scary movies sidney
i like that thing you are doing with your voice randy it is sexy
that is your favorite scary movie
do not start you know i do not watch that shit
are you alone in the house
that is so unoriginal you disappoint me randy
maybe that is because i am not randy
so who are you
the question is not who am i the question is where am i
so where are you
why would you call me from my front porch
so where are you
good try randy tell tatum to hurry bye now
looks like you fingered the wrong guy again
are you okay
can you knock
i heard screaming
out at the airport
so call if you need me

fuck you nut case where were you last night
working thank you
the fog terror train prom night  how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies
stop right there
do not shoot it is me
do not come any closer
only if it is a nice meg ryan movie
that was an ice pick  not exactly the same
for about two seconds
and are the police aware you dated the victim
what are you saying that i killed her or something
besides   takes a man to do something like that
i am gonna gut your ass in a second
jesus this place is packed
we had a run in the mass murder section
you coming tonight
if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section
it was all a misunderstanding he did not do anything
you are such a little lap dog he is got killer printed all over his forehead
the why would the police let him go
so that is his reason
maybe sidney would not have sex with him
she is saving herself for you
could be now that billy's tried to mutilate her you think sid would go out with me
and what would be your motive
i thought everything was checked out
that is leatherface doing here
he came to make up
there goes my chance with sid
his movie nut mind has snapped sid he is gone psycho
come on sid give me the gun
you heard billy  shut the fuck up
why are they doing this
and to celebrate this impromptu fall break i propose we have a party tonight my house
remember there's safety in numbers
yeah okay whatever
if tatum sees you  she will draw blood
guess i will not be needing this anymore
why are you doing this
you are crazy  both of you
the official term is psychotic
do you believe this shit
oh god you do not know casey becker and steve forrest were killed last night
no way
and not just killed sid we are talking splatter movie killedsplit open end to end
casey becker she sits next to me in english

it is okay she was supposed to pick me up
just another sleepover at the riley's
just like old times ai not it
do you really think billy did it
he was there tatum
take a message
come on sid
just relax you are at school now no one can get you here
this is a mistake i should not be here
shit what is he doing here
i bet he is pissed
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh
this could be good what do you think sid
i do not know
maybe cotton weary is telling the truth maybe he was having an affair with your mom
if they were having an affair how come that cotton could not prove it in court
you cannot prove a rumor that is why it is a rumor
created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers
it goes further back sid there's been talk about other men
and you believe it
you are right i am cracking up ignore me
hey sid just think if they make a movie about you who's gonna play you
no way
what secret meaning like a satanical thing
hunt why would they ask if you like to hunt
because there's no way a girl could have killed them
i thought you dumped her for me
you know if i were accused of carving up two people i would take the opportunity to skip school
is this not cool or what hey sid what happened
for once stu drop it
that is mature
with that set of lungs  she should be
i got it tatum get me a beer they are in the fridge in the garage
what am i the beer wench
why else
say it anyway  come on how much do you love me
i have to cut his windpipe
you are not a doctor you will hurt him
ellen move aside
stop that
oh the muse we are still having our differences  you know how it is with women
what kind of a horrible thing is that
it still worked in town
i mean the armchair
maybe the antenna's broken
hey the fuse
do you know where fuse box is
look at this  we will have to fix the whole wiring  this stuff is dangerous as hell
we will call for someone from town first thing in the morning
are you crazy  that costs a fortune
do you have a better idea
my father was an electrician already forgot that
hey flower child the sixties are over  and this stuff is hazardous to your health
where are you going
what are you doing
is everything alright  are not you feeling well
maybe i should talk to dr roth about it
i have a funny feeling  do you think we will get over all that is happened
we just have to make a new beginning
i miss tommi so much
so do i believe me
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before
maybe different  i do not know ellen
who was that
now what did i do to deserve this
so did you sleep good
hey you are still here  i suppose you like it here with us
do not tell me you have made friends with that wandering flea circus
where have you been all day
but that is not the point what if all these things are somehow connected
where have you been
events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals
it is just a feeling  do not you sense it too
what what am i supposed to sense
who's that
she was old
old  come look at this  she has wounds  wounds on her head  like thrashes  or bites
maybe an animal
let me guess  another short circuit
martin what
you know what i have to do now and believe me  i do not enjoy doing this
oh ellen  my sweet ellen of course i knew
i told you there is no way out he will not let you go
it is important  he knows the last chapter

anything missing
do not know if it will do any good mr cuthbert
why not
we all love the museum  i come here myself with my kids  we are trying to work with you
i am telling you something's wrong i still have not heard from pendergast  i think you should call it off
it is too late now  guests are arriving  the mayor's car is pulling up
i will go down and speak to him
sweet jesus
if the party goes forward and that is a big if i have arranged for a large police presence
i got it after i was mugged in the subway last spring
where is the walkin safe
behind you
that is the combination
forget it
battery's dead  shit
hurry up
for chrissake i will do it  that is the combination
to the left twice then five no sorry i think it is fifteen it is been a while
fifteen that is next
the whole system is shutting down we have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall
what doors
i told you  they seal off all the cells  they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure 
ippolito  get back here
d'agosta  ippolito  come in
where the hell are you
who are you  the undertaker
special agent pendergast  fbi
vince d'agosta  am i out
the body
that is left of it
we need light in here stat
careful  that mess on the ground is brains
cannot really focus on birds at the moment pendergast  i am trying to keep my breakfast down
in this violent world i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things
i drink  after hours of course  on duty i smoke  do you mind
not at all  i enjoy the smell of a good cigar
so the method of death is the only connection
if you do not mind this could be important
you are kidding
i have got to admit that was a damn sight better than the dog ate my homework
how do you explain the part about beauregard
they heard the victim's name and wove him into their story  nice touch
what happened to them
how big is the subbasement
apparently it is huge
i think i should come with you
pendergast  help  it is right behind us
the subbasement
i smell it  it is here
go out the north exit  there's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases  run
nice to see you lieutenant
this place is a maze
look  it is some kind of letter
did you hear that  my god  he says that mbwun is real
pardon my french but bull shit
lieutenant  it is me
what is it
dr green has to see you
got my hands full here
what happened
it is still back there
how much ammo do we have to make a stand
all right  kawakita cover the rear
i believe in you a hundred percent vince but that is the second time we have been at that intersection
that is that
what does it say
dr john whittlesley
that is that doing here
dear god  where are we lieutenant
we have met  the hacksaw murders  '89
oh yes  who could forget  afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte
what are we talking about here
someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa
curious  there's something missing
the thalamus and the hypothalamus perhaps
please  do not humiliate me further
how can you say that  you know it is not true
yes it is  i am tired and i am no longer needed 
come on  i will walk you back to the elevator
i am not giving up
this is not a death sentence  greg has promised to teach me fly fishing  i will garden  i will write
you are this museum  it will not be the same without you
a blow dart  seed pods  a plant press  pretty unimpressive stuff
whatever it is it must be common on the tepui  john used it as packing material
margo these are not seed pods
what are they
like the claw
look at this  an ambyloid reovirus protein  that explains why the computer's confused  the plant's infected with a virus
with the intelligence of a human being the speed of a greyhound and the strength of a grizzly bear
that is going on
some kind of power failure  maybe it is the storm  do you have a flashlight
dr frock  did you hear that
that is that
i am coming with you
come back and get me
dr frock
do you mean dr whittlesley
something tried to get into this room
and failed  these doors are solid steel
this means there must be an animal loose in the museum
are there any hidden rooms or staircases  places where someone could hide
where is that
i do not know  it was walled over  no one's been down there in years
we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate
dr frock i was wondering  what happened to the rest of whittlesley's plants
you work here
yes i do
what do you do
i am an evolutionary biologist  what do you do
nothing  i am in third grade  that is a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit
evolutionary biologist  i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years
way cool  then you know where the dinosaurs are
this room sucks
she is never going to take us to see the dinosaurs  that lady said they were on the fourth floor
we are not supposed to go back there
i do not want to go this way
what is it
we were just lost okay  and we went down this curvy staircase  at the bottom was a big shadow
big as a house
not that big
and it snuffled the ground like a dog
it had a long tongue teeth this big and yellow eyes
they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's
they were yellow
hard to read in this light  the ink is so faded
the dogs have lost the scent mr pendergast  maybe we should head back
they have got something
shut them up
argo  hobbes
there's something out there  let's go get it now  that is why we came down here is not it
look  it is hobbes  he is all right
jesus what is this
oh no  i smell it
what do you make of it margo
turkish gecko i believe  a lizard
lizard dna and human dna on the same strand  impossible  the sample must be contaminated
what kind of egg is it
these plant fibers are loaded with hormones
4monoxytocin is a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland
so what
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains
is dr frock safe
got to finish this thesis sometime
how about lunch
somehow when all this happened i knew it would come back to john  is he really dead
maybe not
if he were alive he would have contacted me
and john
disappeared  his body was not among the victims
you were going to be married
that was two years ago  john was still in love with me  he would not leave me alone
tell me about the last expedition what was he looking for
a legendary monster called mbwun
what happened
what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there  was he desperate enough to create one
i do not understand
something came up in autopsy tonight  imbedded in beauregard's body we found a claw
my god  then it was an animal
where would we find it
i am not sure  we should split up you take that hall and i will take this one
what happened
i do not know
i heard you calling and i ran after you but you kept disappearing and i could not keep up
where did you see it
that is not what i saw
dr green
i did not imagine it  i know what i saw  are you sure there are enough men in there
what was it
pendergast  are you all right
that was d'agosta
is there another way around
hide quickly
what is it doing
it did not want the fibers  what does that mean
i think it means it is full
then it will not go after the others
no  it is still hunting but not for the hormones
for what
help someone
you smell that
just like john  he will not listen
i have to shoot
he has to look here or i will not get a clear shot  call him margo
i cannot
i am sorry to keep you  how can i help
i want to book a flight to fiji
iwherei in fiji  what island
i am sorry erthe biggest one
i am sorry  i do not have anything for at least a month
ia monthi
it is the busy season
why would not i
i thought you were in a hurry
that is right
you want to book the flight
close up
why is he in the basement
he moved down there after meryl packed up and left
why was not i told  any unpredictable behavior has to be reported  is that the best shot we can get
that is to see
give me a shot from trumangs ring
we have declared a curfew  everyone else is at first positions
all prop cars accounted for
i am sure we will get him on this next sweep
what have we missed
we are not watching the sea
why would we
cue music
what music
he does not care
that and a fat new contract
a window onto the human condition
not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth he gives us a glimpse of ourselves
are we talking emmies
certainly a nomination
we should remind viewers that truman especially as a child presented a challenge for the production
he was curious from birth  premature by two weeks as if he could not wait to get started
that is correct
and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country
all products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value
there's nothing on the show i do not use myself
who are you
the creator of what
a show  that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions
ia showi  then who am i
nothing was real
that is he doing
they removed all physical trace of her but they could not erase the memory
but why did not he just follow her to fiji
because his mother got sick  very sick  he could not leave her  he is a kind boy maybe too kind
how can they have a child
it is not gonna be his you idiot
why not
you think she would go through with it
sure she would
you take japanese
oh yes

turn the car around
please i beg of you  the american army is there  i am iraqi  they will kill me
think we are going to do it  think we are going to war
that is it say
it is a map i think that is what it is
a casual one
damn this is sweet  we are going to be home in no time
yeah  welcome to beautiful iraq  land of enchantment and riches
why yes jaeger  i believe it is
what are we going to do
they should not have been here
we should not have been here epps  there is a war going on
this is miles from the battle lines they were probably deserters
deserters would have run they would not have engaged
what are you doing
you two fighting's not going to get us anything
not much chance of that  jaeger's an idiot
he is not so
what kind of mine
i do not know and i was not about to mess with it
we have got rope
for climbing
all right  let's get out of here
we cannot just go off and
the us army  always an adventure
should be easy going from here  stay on the pass straight to the dot
what do you figure it to be
otherwise whatever we are looking for could be anywhere
where would they go
i do not know  there's a lot of space up here  they could be just about
and they cannot fly around out there forever
you ready
what about the gold
what about it
maybe we should split it up now
we started this together and we are staying together so there's no point in splitting things up now
you are the one with all the ideas
you have had your say wes  now leave it
maybe you have got ideas of your own for the gold  maybe you have already got things worked out
maybe i do
you got no reason to hit me  i am getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around
what happened
stop it
says he wanted food  liar  he wanted the gold
how is he going to want the gold  he could not even know we had it
we cannot just leave him  he will run back to his outfit report our position
you said he was a deserter
that is what he says  he could be a spy or something
you do not know that
you are out of your mind
he is an enemy soldier
i am not going to let you kill him
we are not at war  you and i and jaeger are awol  we have no authority
i have got no stomach for murder
it is a combat action
it is murder and i will not be any part of it
you have got an awful lot of orders in you always giving orders
no navicom  a lot of good you are now epps
lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge
i am the one's got the big stick
suppose i do not go for that
then i suppose it would be insurrection and i suppose i would have to kill you  i suppose
what about jaeger
thanks for taking care of this for me
you disappoint me epps  always figured you to be a man a real bright guy  i had respect for you
they will kill you  you will not make it ten feet before they cut you down
just keep quiet
i have to answer him
so you can give us away
give it to me
atatatatat  atatatatat
what are you doing
knock it off
do not get pissed at me just 'cause i want to be ready when this war starts
ready for what  what are you supposed to be doing
i told you i am shooting iraqis
blow me
do not worry about jaeger  he uses his personality as a form of birth control
oh man you are not going to fall for that
there might be something in there
yeah the deed to the brooklyn bridge
you all want to lay off  god  i hope the iraqis shoot me put me out of my misery
what  what
everybody's got a job to do  figure it this way  at least you get to go home alive
do not even  you are not going to show me that tired map
wellllll if you read it it must be true was it in the star or the enquirer
it is war  people get lost all the time in war cut off
we disappear for awhile  we disappear we came back nobody knows nothing
it is going to be cool wes  it is all all right
now this is war
you are such a pussy you know that how would you get in the army
but that is the great thing about gold  a little goes a long way
you are getting gold and you are going to blow it on wheels
what are you going to do with your uthirdu
invest it
and i am talking about enjoying myself
take the binoculars
whwhat do you think
shut up  both of you shut the hell up
we have got to do something  we have got to turn around
they are not going to
figure they do not want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them
steady it out
she okay
yeah  yeah she is fine
you cannot tell anybody about this
it would make their heads explode
i know
what do we do with the humvee
say it
heyhey  slow up  you do not have to go so fast
faster we get there faster we get back
i am gonnai am just gonna stop for a little water
do not drink up all of yours 'cause you are not getting any of ours
you did not step on any mine
i heard it click
if you stepped on a mine you would be dead by now  nobody uses delayedfuse mines anymore
oh god  oh god
just be cool
it is a mine is not it
just relax
how'm i gonna relax standing on a mine
where you going
me and wes are just going to talk
why you got to move away to talk
we are going to be right over here
you are moving away because it is going to blow up is not it  it is going to blow up
i said nobody dies  nobody dies
my leg is falling asleep
it is not falling asleep  you have only been standing there for three minutes
i am the one who can feel my leg and it is falling asleep
you are going to be fine
when we start running suck up your breath  you are going to get the wind knocked out of you
you do not know that  it could be a trick
this  whatever it is
you are not losing trust are you
i do not hear any
do not
it is a fire fight
iraqis  a bunch of them
they are doing more than slapping
not enough  we are out numbered and out gunned  they would cut us to shreds
x marks the spot
something like that
but the white dot in the middle that is got to mean something
where is it  where would it go
stay low
where the hell is it
what are we going to do  what the hell are we going to do
we are not going to do anything
they are going to kill us
if they land
think there might be more iraqis
a whole lot of nothing
what are you doing
what does it look like i am doing
it looks like you are not doing anything
i am not  and i am not doing anything because there's nothing down here
maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore
it is just a mongoose
is it dead
it is not like i figured  it is cold  and it is heavier than i imagined
we send the gold up that is to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here
he is not going to leave us
why do i have to stay down here
jesus jaeger
i do not see how that plangs any better
all right  you go up i will send up the gold then follow
what the hell took so long
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line  it did not seem that long
wes might be right about that
we should head northeast
what are we going to do  how are we going to find our way back
we got to go back  we got to go back for wes
forget wes
we cannot just leave him
wes is dead
what do you mean no  they can fly us home
they will ask questions want to know why we were out here
we will lie
first wes now you
i am not like wes  wes was crazy
i am sorry about that epps
i am glad i did not have to kill you  i am glad it did not come to that
yeah  well me too
you still got a map on you
i do not want to die
makes two of us
i know what i did just now was crazy but you got to understand how much i want that gold
wonder how the war's going
we cannot just sit here  we have got to start moving so pick
i pick that way
getting cold
it is a desert  that is what deserts do at night they get cold
just let me rest for a second
do not you touch it
i just want to look at it  remind me of what i am dying for
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here
what do you figure it is
place all alone like that  must be a boarder check point
which boarder  saudi  kuwait  syria
we can head back for our lines and they do not even have to know about the gold
well we should identify ourselves
what did you say
i do not know  something wes had taught me  i think it means do not shoot we are your friends
oh god
they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them  they could not tell in the dark
slip out your m16
and then what
and then shoot them
ii never killed anyone before  i told you that

are you embezzling
embezzling is such an ugly word mister bailey  no actually i am trying to get a legal brief together
i do not get it
i still do not get why you are trying to break into the system
not if my tron program was running that would seal the system off if your file's in there
hi alan
my dinner
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health
want one
your old files  
and dillinger's instructions to divert them  it is all there  look even his home phone number when he logged on
how is it going upstairs
did you say group 7 access
yeahpain in the neck you know i was all set
flynn had group 7 access
flynn had access to you too i am not interested in talking about him
oh i wish you would forget about that it was all so long ago i have totally gotten over it
okay okay
i want to go to his place
you call that getting over it
what for
to warn him
of what
for what
i do not think i am cleared for this
hello alan
great can it send me to hawaii
ever since he got that master control program set up system's got more bugs than a bait store
well you have to expect some static computers are just machines after all they cannot think
come on in
alan alan bailey
mmm part of the master control program
no it will run independently it can watchdog the mcp as well
what do you mean 'yes
that all you can say
no nyet negatory not on your tintype no way
oh anything else
oui da yessiree sure 'nuff you betcha
only yes and no  you are a bit
for sure
i am your program
right on the money
way to go we are hauling
this honey does not handle so good in town
this towngs full o' live ones
you said it
no problem masterc if you have seen one consumer electronics show  that is up
yes  it felt like flynn
he is still looking for that old file cannot you just appropriate it
i would if i could find it it is stashed somewhere off in the system  out of my range meanwhile
i think we would better shut off all access till we can find that file just to be safe
ed i am so very disappointed in you
it is my fault i programmed you to want so much
and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week
the pentagon
it should not be any harder than general motors was but nowthis is what i get for using humans
now wait a minute  i wrote you
i have gotten 2415 times smarter since then
walter i sympathize but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy 
oh i know all that sometimes i wish i was back in that garage
that was uncalledfor
i am sorry walt so much pressure lately you feel like going for a drink
who is your user program
alanone he calls me may i pass
no tron  must destroy mcp first
dumont where is yori where is flynn
where did you hear that name
well is not it  
the name of my user yeah but how 
that is that
how about over therethat empty memory
greetings program
you are alive
flynn  where is ram
wrote the
well  that is how it is for programs yes but 
i hate to disappoint you pal mostthe time that is how it is for users too
we are on our way  alanone gave me the coding we need to go up against master
hey you guys ok
how about you
a user  in our world
boy the view from up here you know the territory
a little   over there the mountains of data and i think that is the silicon valley
the mcp blasted it there are very few domains left with any power at all
there's another beam
how did you do that flynn
elementary physics a beam of energy can always be diverted ooh my head  are we there yet mommy
flynn we have got to help him
yori steer us over the beam right next to it
you will be having plenty of chances to get hurt do not worry about that
lookjust so i can tell my friends what this dream was about okay where am i
you are aguest of the master control program they are going to make you play video games
yeah yeah  that is great
how about yourself
he was disoriented in transport tron
it is all circuits  must be an inputoutput component
the tower yes  flynn have you remembered anything else about yourself  like what sector you are from
wellmy home sector was called paramus 
paramus wonder what those initials stand for   probably program assist routine  well it sounds like a lovely place
that is going on
we are inside a recognizer  you are crazy  stealing a recognizer 
damn never fails minute the warranty runs out
hey good to see you guys nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple
we have to talk
sohow is the world of serious science
have you been sneaking into the icom system
swelli will log us both on and you can get your tron thing running
you have any idea how much i can sue these jokers for
well just do not forget your old friends when you are rich and famous
hey you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games cheap
thank you master control
butwhat if i cannot
waiti need that
yesacknowledge master control
now sir we did take care of that user you sent us 
yes and now you have got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation
we will get them sir these things take time
new guy
another free program off line  that is his user s'posed to do  
what do you think
you think we can make it there
do you know what he is talking about
yori hey
my quarters
why is everythinglike this
you have grown big program
yesit can take us across the sea of simulation all the way out of the game gridto the mcp
this is flynn the one who busted me out
what is it
power surge the transmission beam's too strong
we have to get off this beam
it is something users do
hi dick i am alabama worley

abrams  yes  how are you today
i am fine
why did he go to see mary rooney
she is the only nurse who is not testifying for the doctors
how good's your intelligence
very good
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr thompson
four cases in three years 
the mangs an ambulance chaser 
i want to settle this thing and be done with it  i do not want the archdiocese exposed
if we were to go to trial would we win the case
well of course it is always dangerous 
it is a generous offer mr galvin nothing can make the woman wellbut we try to compensateto make a gesture
how did you settle on the amount
we thought it was just
that was our insurance company's recommendation
nothing that we can do can make that woman well
and no one will know the truth
what are you doing here
 here's your mail call mrs doneghy 
 yes  get her on the phone 
 he wants to testify 
it looks that way
you know what that would mean  to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he will testify
this is going to drive the ante up
that is the call that i am waiting for
what does it mean
they want to settle    it means a lot of money
no actually she was referred to me  she was dr hagmangs patient
say it
i was her doctor
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth nineteen seventy
anything special about the case
thank you  when debby
dr towler who was in the operating room with you
mary rooney the obstetrical nurse
what did these people do when her heart stopped
we went to code blue
why was not she getting oxygen
well many reasons actually
tell me one
she would aspirated vomitus into her mask
and her heart stopped and she was not getting oxygen
that is right
and what did your team do
well we
a patient riddled with complications questionable information on her on her admitting form
we did everything we could
you reached down into death  now is not that right
my god we tried to save heryou cannot knowyou cannot know
ed concannon
objection we have
to get her heartbeat back
we have touched on this his own witness has said
almost nine minutes  causing brain damage
dr thompson just so the jury knows you never treated deborah ann kaye  is that correct
that is correct  i was engaged to render an opinion
engaged to render an opinion  for a price  is that correct  you are being paid to be here today
just as you are sir
are you boardcertified in anesthesiology doctor
no i am not  it is quite common in new york state
i am just an md
do you know dr robert towler
i know of him
how is that
through through his book
what book is that
methmethodology and technique
of anesthesiology
methodology and techniques of anesthesiology'  yes
how old are you
i am seventyfour years old
uhhuh  still practice a lot of medicine
mr concannon
nothing further your honor
objection  this is riexpect us to accept a photocopy we have the original right
no further questions
you are aware of the penalties for perjury
it is a crime
yes    it is a crime  a serious crime
i would not do it
they lied
they lied'  indeed  when did they lie  and do you know what a lie is
i do  yes
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago
that is not my handwriting
you have just said you signed it
yes i yes i signed it yes but i i did not write that figure
you did not write that figure  and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years
i thought i would need it
 that is all right
the archdiocese called up they said who was our attorney 'cause the case is coming to trial
i doubt we will have to go to trial 
 we told them we did not want it to come out this way
i completely understand 
if i could accept the offer right now i would  they took it back
they gave her the wrong anesthetic
why is that
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittanceshe
that is what the sister said the chart said she ate nine hours prior to
she went in complaining of stomach cramps  good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart
is that what a good doctor would do  how old are you please
i am seventyfour years old
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics

i spoke to her and everything is all right
i what are you talking about  i talked to her this morning and she said
she told me
she did
i just saw her
i have been meaning to come in a long time
you live in the neighborhood
uhhuh  my nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months so i stopped by
how old is he
thank you
you are really  you are you the one they told me was the nurse
i used to be a nurse
these are your initials 'kc'
what did she say
she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital
and did you write the numeral one' down on the record standing for one hour
i did
i want to buy you a drink
it is a long road that has no turning
you have a record of what happened in the operating room
yes that is correct
of the procedures
yes the roving nurse
but those notations stop  fourandonehalf minutes after deborah ann kaye's
we we were rather busy
fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped    and they resume seven minutes
as i have said we had some more
they start again three minutes earlier
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes   we were trying to restore her
what happened in those three
we were trying to restore her heartbeat
what happened in those three minutes
we would gone to 'code blue' we were administering electro
huh  and why is that
how'm i doing so far
stearns harrington you know who that is
in english please
it was very wellhidden there was no way to see it until it was too late
you sonofabitch i am going to kill you
my first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate
we do not know how but sid 67 made himself into an android
recognize this how would you like your old job back
if you try to run i will hunt you down and kill you myself
what are they doing in los feliz
madison lives two blocks from their present location
why would they be going there
i do not know
barnes would not kill two innocent guards
you all right
what the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for
he was a computer program for crissake
you were supposed to act as if everything was real
what about them
you are wasting your time i am not going to play any more of your goddam games
parker barnes i would like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane
these were taken inside letac an hour ago pretty pictures are not they
i have seen worse
jesus christ  can you kill it
she is going to help you understand what makes sid 67 tick
this is the personnel file on the programmer lindenmeyer there might be something in it you can use
she was not part of the deal cox
officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couplecompletely gutted  so were the first two cops to arrive on scene
their weapons missing
sid 67 is now armed
do not worry they have no idea where you are
she saved your life parker she did not have to but she did
when this is over will you get this goddam thing out of my head
on my life i promise you i will
until we know what new influences are affecting him we cannot be sure
i am not sure my guess is that is what sid wants us to think
there is no way parker killed those guards no way
i think we both know who did  that is so urgent
why did not anybody tell me
give me 30 seconds then flip every switch you can reach
that is the assignment
only because i got pulled out early
think you can do it
not from in here
barnes where the hell have you been
trying to find out where the bomb is where the hell have you been
what did you find out
no but i have confirmed the reelection rally is the target  how much c4 is missing
enough to level an entire city block
if i were you i would get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the biltmore hotel
you know how much man power you are talking about
this better not be a wild goose chase
or what you will authorize my death a second time today
what did cox pull him out early for
barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field remember
i am what
you are to turn over the sid 67 program and all its documentation for immediate destruction is that understood
how does he know who i am
he hearseverything
show is over unless i get to see what you have been working on after hours
i have not been working on anything
do i get to see it or not
get that fucking thing away from me
watching your vr people auto reset gave me the idea
it is nanotechnology is not it machines the size of molecules
coordinated by polymer neural net
it feels so real
it is better than real it is synthetic flesh synthetic blood synthetic organs  it is a physiological machine
how do you kill it
 and you get nanodeath  do not worry i have got a bunch of other ones
you need a maid
that is wrong with parker
how should i know
i wonder how that
he is developing a hemisphere imbalance
do not be angry with me daryl
did you recognize the sonofa bitch who got away
should i have
all they want to produce around here is mediocrity
true genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime
it was you was not it
she is some of your finest work daryl
you catching my drift
sid  no
i am beautiful are not i
how can i ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time daryl
help me get out of here
i am begging youplease do not kill me please
you actually listen to all those tapes
no i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you  how you feeling today
a little less than yesterday
in other words par for the course  how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy
i do not need a babysitter
it was not a lie
you all right
you ready for this
he was reenacting charles mansongs labianca murders
manson did not kill the first cops to arrive on the scene
whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done
what happened when he was 17
you have got a problem with me carrying a gun
what are you doing
checking my pulse it is elevated  you enjoy frightening me do not you
this lindenmeyer's a real piece of work
i am surprised you did not write one about me
remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains
i have been in prison remember
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho
i am the demon from the bottomless pit
 here on earth to create havoc and terror i am war i am death i am destruction david berkowitz 1977
i am impressed
for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ
who said that
hamlet  that is david berkowitz got to do with sid 67
lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain
this is getting you pumped up is not it this is like the world series to you
what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonofabitch before he kills anybody else
give me your wrist
give me a goddam break i am not going to go anywhere alone
told you i was not going to go anywhere
why did not you tell me you had a daughter
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life
she is beautiful you know
want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house
i told you it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes
you should practice lying more often you are awful at it  where to
sid 67 is no longer bound by his programming
relax i know what you meant
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them
do not get out of the car
what the hell's going on
being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day is not it
enjoying yourself
you know i am
this is not a game parker
that is the problem
whatever he was doing here was only the start
real effective security
you could have just flashed him your badge you know
parker  stop stop do not make me shoot you
we know you did not kill those guards
he did not know about the neural toxin  i did
how did you find out about the toxin
sid 67 told me after he killed the two guards he suggested i kill you rather than him
you are not capable of it
the rally's a little obvious as a target do not you think
i told you before grimes liked to be obvious
sid 67 is not grimes
if we find sid lindenmeyer will not be far behind
think he is keeping track of his creation
see something
find out anything
can i ask you something
you do not know
you okay
i think soyou
where the hell are you going
how is your pulse
i could not tell you
what do we do now
where is john
the symphony of collision
you and me have nothing in common
i would not pull the trigger if i were you
it is really too bad you have to miss the grand finale
there you go  best seat in the house
you are going after mayor bennett
are not you going to watch with me
thankyou daryl  you had me going for quite a while there sport
what are you talking about
now is that any way to talk to an old friend
mr wallace i could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow
