the water s going putrid in the barrels
you will be drinking your own piss for the glory of spain and admiral colon bastard
ah leave him alone he is doing no harm
with a face like that i do not want you looking at me you hear
we will all go crazy
we left three weeks ago alonso cannot be that near
cannot be that far i say also i do not like the smell of the sea around here smells like a cunt bad sign
yes your eminence the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ are you familiar with the work of aristotle erathostene ptolemeus
i am your eminence
if they agree to follow me yes
no the portuguese have already discovered black skinned people i too will find other populations and bring them to the word of god
did he not choose a carpenter s son to reveal himself to the world
blind faith is what i consider heresy
if god wills it
the judgment is ours
naturally but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a dispute over a point of geography
on the contrary your eminence it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross
what a tragedy what a waste of a life
a waste let me tell you something arojaz if your name or mine is ever remembered it will only be because of his
i know
i have not given you much of a life
well that is true i have a child by a man who will not marry me who s always leaving
are we going to argue
i would love to argue with you sometimes but you are never here
i find that hard to believe

i do not want you to wait for me
that is something you cannot decide
you do not usually ask
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service
they tried but i did not let them

i am not listening father but i cannot help hearing
he asks when he can come to visit you he left his address
he never had one except aboard my ships
really god i would not know where to start and yet
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind
i am not bargaining
then you are too ambitious
if you will not accept our proposal we will simply find someone who will
for a commoner
don bobadilla is already a judge my dear don cristobal
good we are also in need of judges except there are no thieves
what do i have so many already
to rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation a little hypocrisy goes a long way
call them
look out of that window
roofs towers palaces spires
all of them created by people like me
what is it a tribe an island
island far
tell the chief we thank him
chief knows
tell him his country is very beautiful tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort
chief says he has a god
and also to bring medicine

he has medicine tell him we admire his people
he understands
ask him if he will help
you did the same to your god
you never learned how to speak my language
father i am doing what i think is the best for him and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself
that is what it says
how did you manage it
with some difficulty i had to promise them you were not a total fool
to open a new route to asia at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it
ignorance i believe the indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the canary islands
how can you be so certain
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr esdras
esdras is a jew
so was christ
i will try to remember that marchena

passion is something one cannot control
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted
i have been contradicted all my life eternity
only god knows the meaning of such words my son

if god intends you to go then you will go
damn god
colon do not
forgive me father for i have sinned
father i have betrayed my family i betrayed my men and i betrayed you
what are you saying
i lied the journey will be longer than i said
how long
i am not sure it could be twice the distance
if i tell them they will not follow me you know that i am right father you trust me
my son my son your certitudes are sometimes frightening christopher you must speak to them and if you do not i will
you are bound by an oath father
give me absolution
you will always be older than me father
i knew you would
new worlds create new people
oh so you are a new man
i do not know i have the impression that i did not change that much i still cannot accept the world as it is
what did they say about granada before today
that she was impregnable
surely you can do anything you want
you show no inclination to speak otherwise
thirty seven your majesty and you
they come and go as naked as the day god created them
thank you
there is one thing i would like to understand why do you want to go back after all this
your majesty some men are content to read about things i must see them with my own eyes i cannot be other than i am
the indians have no such word don moxica
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders you will do as i say
we do not need to know
my horse does not work

we have to keep the hopes of these men alive
we are on the verge of a mutiny colon
you think i do not know that
we are lost
the land is there i know it
you do not know anything listen colon these are my ships right so i am telling you we are turning back
and then what half of the water has gone the rest is nearly putrid you know that
jesus maria i should have never listened to you

you bloody
pinzon pinzon all we can do now is go forward think about that
you tell that to them
you are right let the men decide
yes your majesty

we were not expecting immediate profits were we we must have faith we must give time for time
is this true brother buyl

because he is not afraid of me
corn i lius

i remember you now the so called art dealer
i am glad you got your memory back father because you are going to need it where are the stones
why on earth do the stones interest you
personally they are of no interest to me i would rather sell weapons but i have a customer so tell me
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you
why that is wrong with me
i am a priest i am here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it
ah father you are so wrong let me explain
no thank you
follow me life which you so nobly serve comes from destruction look at this empty glass
destroying a glass is one thing killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another
let me reassure you father i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years

bud get wise to the political realities the boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown
that just does not make any sense
i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one
i told you leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys down
i was reading too
that is the story
some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor
i was asking mccrosky commissioner

i have never used the word insane ted
what word would you use elaine
the word is sick ted very very very sick
what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face
i would use the word insane
there s something dangerously wrong with this ship elaine i know its the wiring that toilet s just the tip of the iceberg
ted a toilet s not going to kill anyone
ted there s no time to explain
ted please be careful
not now elaine
i mean until we start to burn up
i just want you to know i love you ted and always will
that might be the news we have been waiting for
sit down elaine if this bomb trick works we just might make it simon was a fool to eject now
you mean
that is right premature ejection
what will happen to him ted
the sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds he will roast like a pig on a spit
not when i am with you ted
i guess you would have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this
kramer the worp control handle just came off in my hand
what can i do doctor rumack
i mean for ted
you can be gentle with him elaine he is been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden

captain oveur your navigator mr unger and your first officer mr dunn
yes sir commander this is mercury one everything seems a okay up here and ready for count down
thanks but we have a terrific woman in on thursdays
say is not that dr barrington the world renowned agronomist
let s go daddy we have to check in he was never appreciated at the institute
ah yes the institute i am familiar with it
now he is would y i n ging and wants to be buried on mercury
do you have an appointment sir
no dammit it is a matter of life or death
you will have to be more specific than that sir
all right it is a matter of death
death death how about the first thursday in march ten o clock
do not try to stop me
but that is not a door the door s over there
that is right striker and we are getting married when we return
look at this wiring it is shorting out under high temperatures
you are tired striker overworked that wiring meets all the safety specifications
i know you have been subtly spreading the word that i am having a breakdown
that damn computer has taken over i am getting out
then elaine was right
do not talk to me about elaine outta my way
pull yourself together we have got to
uh oh thank you it is nothing
you do not have to thank me i am a nurse this is my father dr barrington
not dr barrington the world renowned agronomist
yes he is dying a n would wants to be buried on mercury
i am familiar with your work doctor you will have to excuse me i have to go
you do not have to excuse yourself i am a nurse i understand
i am getting over it if a relationship is not working you cannot force it
no i mean your head sit down i will take a look at it i am a nurse
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me
no i mean your relationship
we were in love but i am not sure i know what love is anymore
love s the same as it always was it is people who change
people change in relation to each other love changes on its own
not if the people change together in relation to that love
sure but that is only when the love itself goes unchanged
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there s change in the two people who share that love
i just wish it was that simple we really were in love you know how it is when you laugh all the time
well we laughed we laughed all the time
we just had a funeral is not that what it means in england as well
then we will just have a peek at the wounds dig em up
i do not want to leave
did not want your father to die either did ya but it happened
it was in latin sir
saying goodbye in their own way in outlawed tartans with outlawed pipes playing outlawed tunes
i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground
invade that is impossible it
we must sue for peace
with cavalry not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ we could outmaneuver their bowmen
it is suicide
you have all sworn to longshanks
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here
no but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything the balliols will kiss his ass so we must
he was a modest man
it will not be long before longshanks too is encased in stone and his crowns divided for others to wear
homage is nothing it is the crown that matters
the crown is that of scotland and scotland is william wallace
he will i know he will
you are surprised he would lie balliol was murdered in a church yesterday you are longshanks new designate you will be king
i hear this wallace is a bandit nothing more
nothing new majesty we have sent riders to speed any word
impossible how dare you bring a panicky lie
so the scots will have none of them will they my armorers have already made a thousand
the scots will fight for us
what choice do they have now they must serve us or starve
but if we have not caught wallace
you let wallace escape your whole army you cannot blame me for this
you directed me to report to you the moment the king s conference was ended
so i did and what was so important about it
scotland he intends
his majesty was quite keen that you should understand
all so very boring he wants me to learn to fight too so let me do it
look at me i said look at me
yes i had thought that i was loathsome to you perhaps i am if i may be excused m lord
you may
you mock us with a smile
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion
wallace s followers
wallace s for treason there is no trial tomorrow he will be charged then executed
you fancy him
i respect him at worst he was a worthy enemy show mercy oh thou great king and win the respect of your own people
before he lost his powers of speech he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead
hamish i thank
mornay has come so will the bruce
we are here to stay we do not care to live if we cannot fight beside ya
i rest
your rest is making me exhausted
probably but we cannot win alone we know that this is the only way
i do not want to be a martyr
we have lived a dream together a dream of freedom
your dreams are not about freedom they are about marion you have to be a hero because you think she sees you is that it
no one of us is enough
how many
three maybe more
with your father and brother gone they will kill us and burn the farm
it is up to us hamish
i wanna have supper waitin
we will get those english pigs tomorrow
aye we will get em
you win
call it a test of soldiery then the english will not let us train with weapons so we train with stones
the test of a soldier is not in his arm it is here
that depends on the man
i could crush you like a roach
i will not
i should a remembered the eggs
is your poppa a ghost or do you converse with god almighty
a patriot
we do not split up
they used hounds on us in ireland it is the only way
he was so brave with courage alone he nearly won
so more men were slaughtered uselessly
he broke because of me i saw it he lost all will to fight
all men lose heart all betray it is exactly why we must make the choices we make
your pardon m lord he asked me to come in his stead
shall i leave m lord
if he wants his queen to rule then you stay and learn how i will deal with him
no he did not
then why does he stay my scouts say he has not advanced
he waits for you he says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him
you spoke with this wallace in private what kind of man is he
a mindless barbarian not a king like you m lord
the scottish nobles have sent him no support his army starves our stall has worked he must withdraw you may return to your embroidery
humbly m lord
this is what happens when you must send a woman and a fool
forgive me sire i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule
my greatness is better demonstrated with this
let her speak
he will fight you forever but what does he fight for freedom first and peace so grant them
against thy king thou vile fool hast thou anything to say
never in my whole life did i swear allegiance to your king
it matters not he is thy king
while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times i cannot commit treason if i have never been his subject
confess and you may receive a quick death deny and you must be purified by pain do you confess do you confess
i do not confess
then on the morrow thou shalt receive they purification and in the end i promise you will beg for the axe
it is not you he dislikes that you are a wallace he just says the wallaces do not seem to live for very long
thank you for accepting
thank you for inviting
i will invite you again but your mother thinks i am crazy
you are and i will come again
no you do not choose your dreams your dreams choose you
i accept your proposal
i am not just saying it
nor i
but i will not give you up to any nobleman
you scare me
i do not want to scare you i want to be yours and you mine every night like this one
this night is too beautiful to have again
i will be with you like this forever
shush it is only been a day and it is seemed like forever
tonight then
my parents are growing suspicious i cannot keep meeting you every night
yes you are and you must wake
i do not want to wake i want to stay with you
and i with you but you must wake
i need you so much i love you
wake up william wake up
how do you know this
last night i slept with a member of the war council
he should not be telling secrets in bed
ah oui englishmen do not know what a tongue is for
wife of edward the king s son
it is battle i want not talk
but now that i am here will you speak with a woman
i have been given nothing god makes men what they are
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities the executioner of the king s nephew my husband s own cousin
peace is made is such ways
slaves are made in such ways
it does me good to see you
because of the way you are looking at me now the same way as when we met
no but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost or simply love me because i love you
sir i come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy
will he show mercy to my country will he take back his soldiers and let us rule ourselves
mercy is to die quickly perhaps even live in the tower in time who knows what can happen if you can only live
if i swear to him then everything i am is dead already
every man dies not every man really lives
it will numb my wits and i must have them all if i am senseless or if i wail then longshanks will have broken me
i cannot bear the thought of your torture take it
and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less
and i will consult with mine
they have tricked us
that is the crazy man saying lord
the dogs have a scent my scent someone must have given it to them
who would do such a thing
no english lord would trust an irishman
bring out our spearmen and set them in the field
aye but it will not let me dream
i came with captain renault
i should have known
my husband is with me too
he is well captain renault s getting broadminded sit down will you have a drink
oh he is just like any other man only more so
no i mean is he trustworthy is his word
now just a minute who told you to ask me that
he did captain renault did
i thought so where is your husband
at the roulette table trying to win enough for our exit visa well of course he is losing
he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
does he know that
oh yes
and he is still willing to give you a visa
yes monsieur
and you want to know
will he keep his word
he always has
and he never knew and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart that would be all right would not it
you want my advice
oh yes please
go back to bulgaria
he is just a lucky guy
thank you but i hardly think
then perhaps for the lady the ring is quite unique
berger norwegian and at your service sir
i am sorry it is
yes monsieur
a champagne cocktail please
in a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
we read five times that you were killed in five different places
no thanks carl
monsieur rick
how long can i afford to stay closed
oh two weeks maybe three
maybe i will not have to a bribe has worked before in the meantime everybody stays on salary
oh thank you herr rick sacha will be happy to hear it i owe him money
i will then i am going to the meeting of the
do not tell me where you are going
i will not
come up here a minute
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance it might attract the police
but sacha always puts out that light
tonight he forgot
yes i come i will do it
yes sir
well i will get it from the safe
i am so upset monsieur rick you know i cannot understand
forget it emil mistakes like that happen all the time
i am awfully sorry
it shall not happen again monsieur
that is all right
er good luck yes
i would better be going
er my check please
i have to warn you sir i beseech you
it has been a pleasure to meet you
hello ferrari how is business at the blue parrot
fine but i would like to buy your cafe
it is not for sale
you have not heard my offer
it is not for sale at any price
what do you want for sam
i do not buy or sell human beings
suppose we ask sam maybe he would like to make a change
suppose we do
my dear rick when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy
no hurry i will have it sent over have a drink with me
i never drink in the morning and every time you send my shipment over it is always just a little bit short
carrying charges my boy carrying charges here sit down there s something i want to talk over with you anyhow
you are a fat hypocrite you do not feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do
practically no one
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
so could i and i am a poor businessman
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
i will tell him when he comes in
rick i will put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
well you are in good company renault and strasser probably think so too
rick do not be a fool take me into your confidence you need a partner
it is certainly not good enough but since i am in a hurry it will have to do
oh by the way my agreement with sam s always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits that still goes
hmmm i happen to know that he gets ten percent but he is worth twenty five
and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i do not sell
of course they stay rick s would not be rick s without them
well so long
i shall remember to pay it to myself
we might as well be frank monsieur it will take a miracle to get you out of casablanca and the germans have outlawed miracles
well good luck but be careful you know you are being shadowed
those letters were not found on ugarte when they arrested him
not for sure monsieur but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick
thank you very much good day
good day
you need not be concerned about me
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
that is also true except for one destination to return to occupied france
occupied france
uh huh under a safe conduct from me
what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
there are only two other alternatives for him
what are they
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
and the other alternative
my dear mademoiselle perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap good night mademoiselle
how nice you remembered but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris
not an easy day to forget
yes i put that dress away when the germans march out i will wear it again
i will
there s still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam
he has not played it in a long time
we said no questions
here s looking at you kid
in america they would bring only a penny i guess that is about all they are worth
i am willing to be overcharged tell me
and i was wondering
why there is no other man in my life
uh huh
that is easy there was he is dead
i am sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions
well only one answer can take care of all our questions
i am on their blacklist already their roll of honor
it is the gestapo they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow
yeah it is pretty bad timing where were you say ten years ago
ten years ago let s see yes i was having a brace put on my teeth where were you
looking for a job
ah that is the new german 77 and judging by the sound only about thirty five miles away
i know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened
no no no no we must leave
yes of course we
the train for marseilles leaves at five o clock i will pick you up at your hotel at four thirty
no no rick not tonight
especially tonight
i would not have come if i had known that you were here believe me rick it is true i did not know
huh you understand how i feel how long was it we had honey
i did not count the days
has it got a wow finish
i do not know the finish yet
well go on tell it maybe one will come to you as you go along
it does not matter
i do not think i will rick
why not after all i got stuck with a railway ticket i think i am entitled to know
no rick no you see victor laszlo is my husband and was even when i knew you in paris
the stairs from the street
richard i had to see you
you use richard again we are back in paris
i went through all that with your husband it is no deal
i know how you feel about me but i am asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause he is fighting for
it was your cause too in your own way you were fighting for the same thing
i am not fighting for anything anymore except myself i am the only cause i am interested in
i would not bring up paris if i were you it is poor salesmanship
please please listen to me if you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth
i would not believe you no matter what you told me you would say anything now to get what you want
i do not have to i have got them right here
put them on the table
if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you you will not stop at anything all right i will make it easier for you
now i do not know i know that i will never have the strength to leave you again
and laszlo
i wish i did not love you so much
no not yet
but it is all right is not it you were able to arrange everything
everything is quite all right
oh rick
because you are getting on that plane
i do not understand what about you
i am staying here with him until the plane gets safely away
but what about us
we will always have paris we did not have we would lost it until you came to casablanca we got it back last night
and i said i would never leave you
hello miss ilsa i never expected to see you again
yes ma am a lot of water under the bridge
some of the old songs sam
yes ma am
i do not know i ai not seen him all night
not tonight no more he ai not coming uh he went home
does he always leave so early
oh he never well he is got a girl up at the blue parrot he goes up there all the time
you used to be a much better liar sam
leave him alone miss ilsa you are bad luck to him
play it once sam for old time s sake
i do not know what you mean miss ilsa
play it sam play as time goes by
oh i cannot remember it miss ilsa i am a little rusty on it
if we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us perhaps ugarte s in some other part of the cafe
will not you join us
victor i am afraid for you
we have been in difficult places before have not we
be careful
i will do not worry
please ilsa do not be hasty
no victor no
but victor if the situation were different if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it
yes i would
and as far away from major strasser as possible
we will discuss it later
victor please do not go to the underground meeting tonight
i must besides it is not often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife
apparently he has the letters
he suggested i ask you
ask me
yes he said ask your wife i do not know why he said that
i know how it is to be lonely is there anything you wish to tell me
no victor there is not
i love you very much my dear
you do not even have to say it i will believe goodnight dear
of course i will be careful
yes i am ready goodbye rick god bless you
rick who s he
mademoiselle you are in rick s and rick is
is what
oh you have already met rick mademoiselle
this is mr laszlo
i was not sure you were the same let s see the last time we met
you are saying this only to make me go
how do you do
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
and about victor laszlo everywhere
will not you join us for a drink
what for
your work
thank you i try
we all try you succeed
not at all
any time
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table
good evening you see here we are again
i take that as a great compliment to sam i suppose he means to you paris of well happier days
go ahead
well is not there some other place it is rather confidential what i have to say
my office
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record you ran guns to ethiopia you fought against the fascists in spain
what of it
is not it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
yes i found that a very expensive hobby too but then i never was much of a businessman
i appreciate it but i do not accept it
i will raise it to two hundred thousand
my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
there must be some reason why you will not let me have them
there is i suggest that you ask your wife
i beg your pardon
i said ask your wife
my wife
thank you
had a close one eh
yes rather
we might as well question why we breathe if we stop breathing we will die if we stop fighting our enemies the world will die
what of it then it will be out of it is misery
you seem to know all about my destiny
apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause well i am also a human being
oh save it we have still lots of things to do
keep it you will need it in america
but we made a deal
oh never mind about that you will not have any trouble in lisbon will you
no it is all arranged
good i have got the letters right here all made out in blank
all except one thing there s something you should know before you leave
monsieur blaine i do not ask you to explain anything
i am going to anyway because it may make a difference to you later on you said you knew about ilsa and me
here it is
yes what is it you want
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay it is not often we have so distinguished a visitor
no please monsieur it is a little game we play they put it on the bill i tear the bill up it is very convenient
very well
no two champagne cocktails please
this is a very interesting cafe i congratulate you
ilsa i do not wish to be the one to say it but it is late
we will be there
i slept very well
that is strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca
may we proceed with the business
with pleasure will not you sit down
thank you
well perhaps i shall like it in casablanca
i was in a german concentration camp for a year that is honor enough for a lifetime
thank you
by the way monsieur last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte
nothing important but may i speak to him now
are you quite finished with us
you were a czechoslovakian now you are a subject of the german reich
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
this is hardly the time or the place
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefect s office with mademoiselle
captain renault i am under your authority is it your order that we come to your office
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris in prague in brussels in amsterdam in oslo in belgrade in athens
even in berlin
yes even in berlin if you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning
good day
thank you captain it is very good to be here
major strasser my aide lieutenant casselle
oh we germans must get used to all climates from russia to the sahara but perhaps you were not referring to the weather
what else my dear major
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
realizing the importance of the case my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects
i have already heard about this cafe and also about mr rick himself
good evening captain
champagne and a tin of caviar
may i recommend veuve cliquot 26 a good french wine
thank you
i expected no less captain
how do you do mr rick
well personally major i will take what comes
do you mind if i ask you a few questions unofficially of course
how about new york
you were not always so carefully neutral we have a complete dossier on you
if rick has the letters he is much too smart to let you find them there
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that he is just another blundering american
but we must not underestimate american blundering i was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
my dear major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people
i have no conviction if that is what you mean i blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy
and if it should change
uh huh i have been thinking it is too dangerous if we let him go it may be too dangerous if we let him stay
i see what you mean
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
but i have no excuse to close it
find one
victor laszlo is on that plane
ask monsieur rick
how extravagant you are throwing away women like that someday they may be scarce
when it comes to women you are a true democrat
why that is in lisbon
the clipper to america
and what in heaven s name brought you to casablanca
my health i came to casablanca for the waters
waters what waters we are in the desert
i was misinformed
what again
this is no ordinary arrest a murderer no less
i stick my neck out for nobody
a wise foreign policy
perhaps not
yeah have a brandy
victor laszlo
victor laszlo
well he is succeeded in impressing half the world
it is my duty to see that he does not impress the other half rick laszlo must never reach america he stays in casablanca
it will be interesting to see how he manages
manages what
his escape
oh but i just told you
stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
this is the end of the chase
twenty thousand francs says it is not
i just paid out twenty i would like to get it back
make it ten i am only a poor corrupt official
why two
he is traveling with a lady
he will take one
it does not matter there is no exit visa for him
louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
because my dear ricky i suspect that under that cynical shell you are at heart a sentimentalist
the winning side would have paid you much better
maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
i have my orders
oh i see gestapo spank
excuse me
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich
i was born in new york city if that will help you any
hello ilsa
thanks i will
another precedent gone this has been a very interesting evening i will call you a cab gasoline rationing time of night
that was some going over your men gave my place this afternoon we just barely got cleaned up in time to open
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
well it looks like you are a little late
yeah why
why do you interfere with my little romances
put it down as a gesture to love
i am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
what makes you think i would stick my neck out for laszlo
do not count too much on my friendship ricky in this matter i am powerless besides i might lose ten thousand francs
what friend
ilsa lund that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape the last man i want to see in america
then release him you be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves
i will make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor s pen
ricky i am going to miss you apparently you are the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i
oh thanks
go ahead ricky
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel so i knew i would be on time
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs
oh he will not be followed here
yes i know what you mean but i have already spoken to ferrari you will still win at roulette
is everything ready
tell me when we searched the place where were they
sam s piano
serves me right for not being musical
have you taken leave of your senses
i have sit down over there
put that gun down
i do we have got plenty of time to discuss that later
call off your watch dogs you said
just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them and remember this gun s pointed right at your heart
that is my least vulnerable spot
you think of everything do not you
and the names are mr and mrs victor laszlo
stay where you are i do not know what you are talking about
maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
i think perhaps you are right
our expenses
uh huh
louis i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
that is so long ago i do not remember
will i see you tonight
i never make plans that far ahead
sacha she is had enough
do not listen to him sacha fill it up
sacha call a cab
take your hands off me
what is your nationality
i am a drunkard
there seems to be no secret about that
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris
it is not particularly my beloved paris
aha who do you think will win the war
i have not the slightest idea
in this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
not particularly i understand the point of view of the hound too
good evening mr blaine
i was willing to shoot captain renault and i am willing to shoot you
get me the radio tower
put it down
hello ugarte
well what makes you think i have not
oh nothing but when you first came to casablanca i thought
you thought what
they got a lucky break yesterday they were just two german clerks today they are the honored dead
you are a very cynical person rick if you will forgive me for saying so
if i gave you any thought i probably would
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renault s price i get it for them for half is that so parasitic
i do not mind a parasite i object to a cut rate one
well rick after tonight i will be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca
who did you bribe for your visa renault or yourself
myself i found myself much more reasonable
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
i do not want them here overnight
do not be afraid of that please keep them for me thank you i knew i could trust you
do not be a fool you cannot get away
rick hide me do something you must help me rick do something
i like it fine here
he will double what i pay you
yeah but i ai not got time to spend the money i make here
not right now
good then have a drink
no not me boss
then do not have a drink
boss let s get out of here
no sir i am waiting for a lady

no sir i am staying right here
yeah boss
sam if it is december 1941 in casablanca what time is it in new york

well stop it you know what i want to hear
no i do not

how lovely
i have always thought that myself
oh yes
i will join you shortly
yes very well i think are the girls in bed
yes and they send their kisses would you like your sherry now
no i think a whiskey
and what qualities are those intelligence or stupidity
i am sure i do not know freddie
well these things take time
do you
dinner will be served shortly dear
oh i have just been thinking about something that man bytes said
oh freddie what could that wretched vampire say to upset you
that i am very little different from him
am i a good man or am i a bad man
oh frederick
did you see it
what is it
like this
i will get my bag
aw bytes he is sick
he is doing it to spite me i tell you and it is got to stop
he is sick bytes he is going to die
if he does it is his own fault but i am not burying that swollen bag of flesh
i will show you i will show you
shut up
what do you mean
he was fine when he left here and now look at him
i intend to
he fell he falls
he must have taken quite a fall
why is he sitting up like this he needs rest
that is the way he sleeps if he lays down he will die head s too heavy
cannot you fix him up here he is my livelihood listen
everything will be seen to
just a moment how did you get in here
never mind that i want my man
he is still very sick please come downstairs with me i will explain the situation
pull the other one why do not you we made a deal
i know what you have done to him and he is never going back to that
he is a freak that is how they live we are partners him and i business partners you are willfully depriving me of my livlihood
all you do is profit from another man s misery
i want him back
so you can beat him so you can starve him a dog in the street would fare better with you
i have got my rights damn you and i am going to the authorities
right right
good morning sir
you have acquired a taste for this
it is quite nutritious sir
do not be mad this muck can kill you
why is not he in the general ward then
well sir he is quite seriously deformed and i fear the other patients would find him rather shocking
deformed is that it then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable
yes sir
what are your plans then treves you are aware that the london does not accept incurables the rules are quite clear on that point
yes i am well aware of that but this case is quite exceptional
oh is he a friend of yours
no more of an acquaintance
ah no sir i had planned to see them in the morning
good how is the patient
well sir perhaps i should explain
mr treves it is out of the question i want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do i am sorry
thank you very much sir shall we say in a few days then
shall we say two o clock tomorrow afternoon
wh whatever is most convenient for you sir
two o clock then you know treves it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance
yes sir
and what was that john
yes i am very sorry to have wasted your time sir i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him
i do not understand
tell me john how did you know the rest of the 23rd psalm
not me sir mr merrick he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness
yes i think i can
no you cannot you cannot begin to know no one can
i could easily arrange
of course they will they are reasonable men
frankly treves it is not what i would expected a few small cheques well wishers do not worry these things undoubtedly take time
but he is so afraid he is going to be carted off i have promised him that will not happen
well i will let you know if there s something in the afternoon post
please do
steady on treves have a seat
i feel much better thank you for asking and you
i am feeling very fit thank you how is your bronchitis

saw what mr cooper what did you really see because what you are describing is not physically possible
i am telling you i saw it
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
i know what i saw and it was not a fucking optical effect
it is not
i do not know the screens are dead
you are okay now it is over
there must be a way what about engineering
can you shut it down
i do not know the process dr weir was the expert
i do not want to go where the last crew went i would rather be dead
his vitals are stable but he is unresponsive to stimuli he might wake up in fifteen minutes he might not wake up at all
goddammit dj it was not a hallucination i saw a man he was on fire and then he disappeared
i do not need sleep dj i need answers
we will make it
i have been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
go on
it is not a distress call it is a warning
it gets worse
hear what
it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell
save yourself from hell what are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
what happened
weir he used one of the explosives from the corridor
please kill
oh god
nothing it is nothing
a power drain
you did not hear it you must have heard it
he is crashing
his peritoneum has ruptured
one thing at a time let s keep him breathing start the drip 15cc s fibrinogen christ he is bleeding out
i apologize for the short notice bill but we have had something come up that requires your immediate attention lyle
i would not bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and i would codes
it is the event horizon she is come back
do not thank me bill i am not doing you any favors
navigation control tried to hail the vessel this was the only response
that is on your mind
he does not belong on this mission responsible or not he blames himself he is too close to it and then there s his wife
it is been two years since she died he is over it
some things you do not get over
the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt she is docked in bay four
it will not stop it goes on and on and on
what does
the dark inside me
the dark inside i do not understand
from the other place
i built it
we still have pressure the radiation count s steady at 7 millirads an hour
background radiation perfectly safe
that is the second containment seal beyond that engineering
i am going in
start the countdown
almost done i just gotta check one thing
justin i will not let you die
dr weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
the crew could they still be alive
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months they are been gone seven years
someone sent that message admiral you have to put me on that ship
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers good for four months
i put in for a replacement for you but no one
clear and open on my mark three two one mark
ice crystals everywhere this place is a deep freeze
so where are they starck any luck with the bio scan
i do not know this place is really dark i cannot see a thing
starck you still showing those readings
there s no one here skipper
what you got peters
the science workstation has power i will see if i can find the crew from here
how is the client
yeah i am i am okay
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
fine starck i want you to repeat the bio scan
do it
i will get back to the log but on the bridge i will not go back back in there
the clock is running dr weir if you will follow the rest of the crew they will show you to the gravity tanks
until then do what you are told and stay out of my way
that is what we are here to find out
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
be careful it is not a load bearing structure
captain i did not come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
once the ship is secured we will bring you on board
that is not acceptable
peters and i will search the forward decks justin take engineering no hot dogging not on this one alright
captain miller the foredecks are just ahead
they are empty dr weir moving forward
dr weir s right get on board the event horizon i will meet you at the airlock
it is possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core distorting space time they could be what hit the lewis and clark
what could cause them that is in the core
it is complicated
how much time do you need we have seventeen hours and forty two minutes now what is in the core
if it worked yes
there s no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields it is under control
your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart it may have killed one of my men no one goes near that thing
the date
what about it
the event horizon s computer think s it is 2034
it is 2041
exactly the ship s internal clock is off by seven years
i do not know
the core
check the core for radiation carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
do it
justin just tried to kill himself the man is clearly insane
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations
that is bullshit and you know it you built this fucking ship and all i have heard from you is bullshit
what do you want me to say
you said this ship creates a gateway
i do not know
where has it been for the past seven years
i do not know
the other place what is that
i do not know i do not know there s a lot of things going on here that i do not understand truth takes time
that is exactly what we do not have doctor
you cannot your orders are specific
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship the crew is dead dr weir this ship killed them and now it is killing us
you are insane you have lost your mind
it is done
watch me
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark doctor or you will find yourself looking for a ride home
son of a bitch
i do not need them anymore where we are going we will not need eyes to see
what are you talking about
what makes you think i will miss
then who the fuck are you
your fear do you remember the goliath miller
you know
you want me to believe you are the devil well i do not that is bullshit
i am not the devil
then what what are you tell me
better if i just show you
you are lying
i am not asking you to believe me you will see for yourself and so will your crew you are all coming with me
starck cooper
locked and cocked
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
one four degrees
bring us in tight starck get on the horn see if anyone s listening
that is not it that ship was built to go faster than light that is just wrong it goes against everything we know
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings
something like that yeah
yes sir
dr weir
i noticed starck anybody home
where is it
love to
starck give me a read
smith where the hell have you been
we have a situation here
we do not have time to fart
they are gone
i am here smith how is the clark
that is enough
captain we got a problem
now what
she was right behind me i turn around she is gone she could be anywhere
alright prep the clark for launch i will find her
i just saw weir i think he was messing around on the clark
come again skipper
one of the explosives is missing from the corridor i think weir may have put it on the clark
no no we just got her back together
get out of there now
smith smith fuck
let s go
i just finished drying
then what are you doing here come on people let s go and cooper put some pants on
come around to three three four
radiation interference
keep your eyes open
we are all here
okay let s find out how much time we just bought
but you can breathe it
how much oh two do we have
oxygen is not the problem
carbon dioxide
it is building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot
we can take the filters from the clark
i do not know but whatever it is it is not the crew
not acceptable i want to know that is causing those readings if the crew is dead i want the bodies i want the crew found
i can reconfigure the scan for c 12 amylase proteins
do it dr weir
no it was someone else
i ran the bio scan with the dna rna filter the results were bio readings of indeterminate origin
bio readings of indeterminate origin do not you have anything useful to tell me
i have got a theory
to what what are you saying this ship is alive
i did not say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
we are hanging on by our fingernails and you are giving me bullshit stories
starck do you know how crazy that sounds it is impossible
i know that
i thought you wanted an answer and that is the only one i have
nine hours and twenty two minutes
that is going on in there starck
justin s in the airlock
stay here do not stop working
you better hurry he is engaged the override we cannot open the inner door
five seconds
whatever was on that bridge was not weir
we have got to shut it down we have got to
blow it up
we blow the corridor use the foredecks as a lifeboat separate it from the rest of the ship we stay put
no i will be right back
repeat we are armed
miller he is back he was in the tank
he served on the goliath
was not that ship destroyed
they are explosive charges
you are at the bridge ms peters you still have not seen any crew
blood looks like arterial spray
can you see a body
there s no one here
i did
is not it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
i have seen bodies before this is different
not according to the computer
can you shut it down
keep him talking
do you know what it was
come on baby bear open this door
skipper justin just activated the door it is on a thirty second delay
it is cold
i do not care
dead ahead 5000 meters
she is not ugly
that is the core the gravity drive the heart of the ship
we are losing atmosphere
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
hey you do not need to be a scientist figure it out
all boards are green everything s five by five
the law of relativity prohibits faster than light travel
matching speed now range to target ten thousand meters and closing skipper i got a bad feeling about this
range 3000 meters and closing
1000 meters
picking up magnetic interference
explosive decompression
decompression would not do that
get them back
i am trying goddammit
i do not think this is a good idea we do not even know what happened on that ship
wrong the shortest distance between two points
do they have pressure
if they were in stasis i would get a location but these readings they are all over the ship it does not make any sense
ship s log
i do not know the life readings just went off the scale
yes i miss her she died two years now
i am sorry
no there s no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind it is as if time just stopped for seven years
it wants me i have to go
i am alright please
the forward airlock
miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock
it means nothing
by grabthar s hammer dr lazarus i
do not do that i am not kidding
i am sorry sir i was only
just do not
yes sir your quarters sir
yes sir marvelous is not it completely distractionless
where is my bed
uh uh what did we talk about
right sorry sir
quellek what are you doing in there
i avoided capture using the mak tar stealth haze where is everyone
come with me i will explain on the way
i i do not think i am going to make it sir
no do not talk like that son we are going to get you fixed up
you will forgive my impertinence sir but even though we had never before met always considered you as a father to me
friend you stole all my best lines you cut me out of episode two entirely
i will not and nothing you say
the show must go on
damn you damn you
to camera center no matter whose shot you are blocking
come in protector protector
like throwing gasoline on a fire
we stop we die keep holding the thruster down tommy
you do not hold a thruster down it is for quick boosts
like you know
do not be insane stop full stop
keep going keep going
that is the scale is that ten miles a hundred miles
this much
must be some sort of mining facility
you go first there s no time
kill it well i am open to ideas
well you have to figure out what it wants that is its motivation
it is a damn rock monster it does not have motivation
shut up just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity
i was staying in character egomaniacal sonofabitch
sense memory i see you got to win the fight
i had the shot
yes good was done this
okay let s go buddy they can take it from here i mo
oh and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us
i played richard iii
no i cannot go out there i will not say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time i will not i cannot
jason what have you gotten us into
no jason that is a wrap there s nothing to think about
they are drifting toward me i think they are magnetic
the engines are dead we are drifting
shut up
you know with the makeup and everything1 i actually thought he was smart for a second
you think you could do better laredo
hey watch that laredo shit
sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps
the guy is terminally selfish
dear god how did i come to this
oh cannot i watch me
why did not you stop at the market
i still have not got this bloody thing off
you could order something in
a boy comes to the door
i do not know it just was not like him
all this from watching the historical records
shit i am doing it i am repeating the damn computer
the ships are gaining
front armor is gone just slow it down a little
alex where are you going
to see if there s a pub
could they be the miners
nobody was watching
it does not make sense surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures
down there
no i did not
yes you did
by grabthar s hammer this is true 159	nt living room somewhere night	159
he probably has some very important business to attend to
you have got the utility systems walkthrough right
i have sectors 1 28 i think hector has the upper levels
we would better get everybody online and kyle stop downloading porn your frame rate is unacceptable
yes but we were wondering
there is no quantum flux and there is no auxiliary there s no goddamn ship do you get it
oh oh i see oh
that is your name son
yes i know and i want you to know i thought about what you said i know you meant it constructively but
it is okay listen
i knew it i knew it
brandon the crew and i are in trouble and we need your help
okay you can go on in i am going to get kyle he knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive
okay okay now what
now make a right you will see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility the bowels of the ship
okay so do you see a door marked core unit should be down at the far end to your left
yes commander
what does the omega 13 do
well that is the big question is not it
what do you mean
my cousin s boyfriend s sister went out with the screenwriter his favorite movie is the omegaman he is seen it 13 times
yes commander all right you are almost there just go through the chompers and over the pit
wait two seconds then go
lt madison go
shit go
go commander
berithium lava coming through use the handholds above you
raise the glass and push the blue button
that is it
yeah that is wrong jason othino i ust oncuont ot wou o oc oomooooateo onan onat
we are getting major structural damage
there is no weather in space
i never get tired of that joke
guys we are sustaining structural damage
the enemy is matching velocity
the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress
it is fractured
we need another one
no we do not have an extra beryllium sphere
all systems are working commander
all systems are working commander cc	pink c
that possibly the valence bonds have shifted bi laterally
what does that mean
what does that mean yes i see yes it means that perhaps the bonding molecules have become covalent
covalent right so
so our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate a two molecule compound sharing a free electron and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes
never mind fred
no no i will think on it
listen fred you did this for four years on the show you can do it now put your hands on the controls
hopkins cannot drink your bathwater fred
oh i make it up use lots of k s and v s
i do not like this i do not like this at all
of course we will just zap him up with the digital conveyor
listen i will go in create a distraction have this may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape
it is suicide
sure guy if you can stand the excitement
you know us
it is incredible
the lost footage at the convention the mysterious device in our last episo historical document
something bad happened here
let s get out of here before one of those things kills guy
we are doing episode 31 jason
we should have a turbo i am always saying activate turbo boosters right
oh i am not i am not then that is my last name
your last name
yeah what is it
it is i do not know
all right let s all settle down if we are going to get through this we are going to have to exercise self control
let s just pick up the pace a little shall we
jason are we doing episode 31 or not
it is a rough plan guy what does it matter if we are doing episode 31 or not
because i died in episode 31
a lathe get off the line guy
no keep all energy to the armor
hey thanks for one nice intro uh
hey you want to drive
we are doing episode 31
whatever the one with the hologram the wall of fire
where would they go back inside
not a clue you
i think he just likes pointing at things
we made it commander we made it m alexander sort ov by grabtnar s h mmer we ove to te ono tale
we made it commander we made it
how much of a nothing not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing
what do you want me to say gwen they wanted the commander
you know it is one thing to treat us this way but how can you do this to your fans
one minute i am hey i am dressing
oh come on it is not like i have not
only answers to me
but i am the commander
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says so that is what they built
c mon we are wanted up on the command deck
tell them about
who we are do not you think they are going to be pissed
are you kidding i am not going to tell them
well you have to tell them what if something happens we are actors not astronauts we cannot do this stuff
it is not the stuff i mean anybody can learn the stuff the important thing is commitmnt 99 of anything is just committing to it
ninty nine percent of acting is commitment acting stella adler never manned a resonance cannon she taught acting
we have no right to do this they deserve to know
gwen gwen c mon wait no
let me think i need time to think
mathesar maybe we should get some of your crew up here
i thought it was the we are dead gesture i was agreeing like i know where the hold button is
listen sarris you cannot blame me for trying
i do not think that is a cloud
no i do not think so wait they are not but something is oh my god
computer can it be repaired
computer do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard
did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me
i could have held on to you
do not be ridiculous
it helps
will you stop riding me
yes yes i am here
yeah but i have got gorignak staring me in the face i think i can take it though
jason we are going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there
nothing hold please
turn on the translation circuit
what the hell are you talking about
wait jason here
because it was on the show
well forget it i am not going this episode was badly written
mark 12
tommy 270 degree turn to port
this is great they are going to start eating each other out there
tomorrow morning before the store opening
almost as much as he loves himself
do not do it tommy he is not worth it
i do not know guys i mean he almost looked sincere i know it is bizarre
i have one job on this lousy ship it is stupid but i am going to do it got it
sure no problem
i cannot it is on autopilot
that thing s not going to get us down there fast enough face it he is dead
wait fred what about your thing you know digitize me sergeant chen
is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now
closer i can try
what are you doing what are thev doino 7c int sarris ship	h37c
i see them i see them rd street	pasadena 57
better than my lieutenant he failed to activate ship s neutron armor as quickly as i would hoped on our last encounter
listen i would like to but frankly i am not even sure where it is or even
you have ten seconds
all right you got it you win i will deliver it now just give me a moment to set it up
i do not know
stop please i do not know
prepare a tear harness for the female
no i swear i do not know please
do you think i am a fool that the commander does not know every bolt every weld of his ship
please do not hurt them it is not their fault i am not the commander i do not know anything
our dimwitted friends do not understand the concept of acting they have no theater no imagination these scientists
we pretend
yes you understand that do not you mathesar
this is embarrassing really i sha not tell this story when i return home
catch me later okay
mind if we skip that i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys
as you wish
yeah earth time to get back to earth kids
right long live that is your planet
but what if sarris survives
oh i do not think so i gave him both barrels
he has a very powerful ship perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of
it was a lot of fun you kids are great
it is perfectly safe i promise
maintenance facility
wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars we will be there this fine ship this fine crew never give up never surrender
no thank god he has not
then how did he find out about the device
our former commander was not strong
former commander
i am sorry you deserve to be shown
it is the tothian mine field left standing from the great war of 12185
you what what are you talking about
we have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations the fault must lie with us with the ship
well sort of
but there it is
a model only as big as this
but inside i have seen
it is difficult to on our planet we pretend in order to entertain
i did not say that i said would not it be great if we could always work together that is what i said
and determination
wh where are we
twenty third quadrant of gamma sector i can show you on a map
i think we are going to exit the space port
they designed the ship from watching you so take her out lieutenant
why do not you just turn it on and see
it is as far as it goes
push it hold it down
oh god
what kind of signal
tommy we have these
okay let s go
good work tommy let s go
how about the pig lizard
hey i was doing okay with the pig lizard
it does not have eyes
the throat the mouth its vulnerable spots
it is a rock it does not have vulnerable spots
we have got to get out of here c mon hurry
practice driving tommy
pedal to the metal
commander call me laredo
mark 20 into the black hole areao
i am trying commander everything s a blur but as long as i stay locked to that vox signal
patience lt patience
but sir my men the core implosion is not reversible
find them
get oack on their tail
because they are coming right at us
fire at will hi would nt protector
we are nearly there lucilla
that is what you told me two days ago
will you please get back in your wagon and stay there
i am tired of being stuck in that wagon
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed
oh stay do not you want to join the chorus of praises for narcissus glory just remember he is a married man
and caesar let s not forget to serve caesar
why then they will notice when i am gone well i am making a public appearance are not i
maybe you should get married pick one of your cousins it would demonstrate a profound stability
if you get me pregnant with a boy he will be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne
i am sure i do not know
i want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house if it is worth something then sell it
commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father except that he cannot heave out his ghost
if i may be so bold
for the gods spit it out
why not do it in the colosseum
you cannot do that you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you
you are coming back
taking my pleasure do i need to clear my lovers with you
you must start clearing everything with me especially your lovers
why are you so surly you have won brother the people have bread and the city is quiet
what is that wailing
the fans of narcissus they were on vigil outside the school of proximo they believe he is dying
now that we are done with that infatuation forever
if i ever loved narcissus it was not like you want
but i get what i want always do not i
yes go on
you cannot do that listen to the mood of the crowd
i want that bastard dead
you want control of the crowd you cannot get it by killing their hero
i am their hero
not yet dear brother
send them out
do you want posters too
you would have had a full scale revolt on your hands
of course but not now however if he continues to be unwell you may report to me
that is difficult to say general
perhaps master galen you may say
gladly caesar
or perhaps into a new one but here s to your god and the courage of our legions
oh but with the army behind you you could become extremely political not a republican by any chance
the dangerous man caesar is the man who does not care
you flatter me caesar
being as close i am certain you have noticed what we all have noticed
we have to stop the germans now
apparently my opinion was not needed
cooperate and they will be returned to your estate i could have executed you
and my army would have thrown your body into the danube
ignore that the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better
at least stay for the running of the animals you are paying for it you know
until your confirmation date
at the opening of the month of janus i will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship
yes you know that is not a bad idea
maybe it will crush gaius
i am serious
so am i
we can crush gaius another way what if you do throw something to the people they really want make them a gift of food
give away food
make a gift to the people it is your money anyway so it is only fair
i would not know who to bet on
he left us at dawn
i met with falco and the senators have agreed to call for a truce with the germans
narcissus will never support you caesar he has too much of a philosophical temperament
where is the emperor and the army soldier
he must have been he was on the list of prisoners to be executed
caesar i did my best the colosseum is not under my control
jerses tomorrow
yes caesar
we need more statues perhaps i should open medical clinics for the poor citizens only though
this is cos this precocious young man a scribe for the daily action i have invited him to write a small piece about you
i do not know
agh please he is having a secret device constructed for the circus the brass craftsmen are working overtime
i will nose around
that is their job is not it to argue so i think my case will be long on talk and short on action
i am prepared to write anything you tell me
the exact month when the emperor must be confirmed
god of passages and changes
i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory thanks to marcus aurelius
but have never been
we all know what right is senator
you are hearing about somebody else
how did you get condemned to the arena without a trial
when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial you would have to give me your word
i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing
you are a citizen and a soldier not a gladiator
you do not know how wrong you are
why you
my loyalties were in doubt
fools to let us both live we will be our own best witnesses at our trial
that is what worries me
they cannot if this is rome
narcissus terrified you the only thing he is scared of is me
only from a distance
sneaking around with your brother
without him he would be weeping if he overheard that well the idea of you as my adopted brother is very exciting
i am not fit for the job and as a matter of fact i am not taking the job
why do you keep playing at being so humble it is a little embarrassing
why do you play at being drunk
yours will do
you mean a symbol of someone who does not exist
but you do exist narcissus hero of the battle of the danube
do you remember your epictetus that little homily we recited when we were children the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans
would that marcus had lived
marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son
he killed his father and then my family
narcissus i have your family they are alive all of them
the fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they are most vulnerable
i will marcus but you are going to be well enough to direct it yourself
he is like you sir too tough for the gods to swallow
the senators admire you
they fear me
much more colorful than the ones we wear and of course less dented
on your honor as a roman officer daddy
on my honor as your daddy
let s hope he does not start giving orders
what the hell do you think it was about there s nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others
why do not we try to keep politics out of the conversation
well we can try
what deal
rome is going to pay an allotment to the german tribes on an annual basis
my troops do not make policy
well they die for it
i was summoned
it is your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons
it is my job to keep my job and that by the way is now head of praetorian guard good ole tribuus has been retired
quintus you have got at least a division with you we could take rome away from commodus and give it back to the senate
is not the helmet magnificent
they are studying with cynics
of course
i can see that
the battle is over the war is over you have won
i have been overseeing production myself for the past three years you will be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become
we do not need your help we are doing great on our own
quintus is overly idealistic
i never knew a more idealistic man than you
me well i believe in rome you would have to after what i have seen how people outside the empire treat each other
i do not even want to imagine the things you have seen
what you do not want to imagine is the things i have done
your daughters need more than some vapors they need you
that is what i am going to do that is what i am going to do
i killed too many barbarians
general all i know is you have been condemned to the colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen
impossible every citizen has a right to trial this is rome
chain him
to fight we will see
i am not a gladiator i refuse to fight
then you will die just know this because you asked i asked i am sorry but
i did not get killed and everyone else did
that is one way to look at it
think about it just think about it
do not be ridiculous
lucky it did not step on his head
what the hell are you talking about greek
you get to come alive again in the country
as what the galloping gladiator
the point is you get to fight the easy country circuit the small arenas relax live the good life
on you of course you are my bravest fighter the best fighter i have ever seen
such nobility from such an ignoble mouth take my advice and make that bet
a great deal they designed and build tiger s chariot
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right they do not waste time
i can really rape them on this can i at least tell them you will think about it
no tell them i will do it but i want more posters all over rome
fantastic wonderful but posters are very expensive
then get a large cash advance

i want another interview with cos tell him to bring plenty of ink
i will do it sure as there s shit in the tiber we are all going to die but for you anything
you were a soldier and then a gladiator were not you
was i
something else then do the chariot races interest you
it is for your cigarette i prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants
they said on the phone you were assigned to the meyers case
with all due respect detective you cannot go blaming every brutal murder in illinois on michael meyers
right so why do not we get on with this investigation
i like a woman who takes control
that do not match either of the victim s
unable to escape she turns and attacks the killer but does not connect
no blood on the knife
broken blood vessels on her right forearm
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains
girl scouts
yeah alright i will be there in ten
only the real stiffs
i can be real stiff
care to join me
come on carter you know it is michael

of course not i am curious not sick
well you cannot have them all
come on i do not want to miss the filing in there will be some i know tonight i think
only a few you are just not trying
i am in my party mood
yes but you look a little rusty to me what were you doing wondering
you why you are already beautiful
no it is that last runner someone in 483 was trying to help him
did you ever see anybody renew
i think you have been skulling out too much first nursery and now stupid questions
did you
of course
anybody we know
look why do not you get into the water you need it more than i do
i am fine see you
at carousel tonight
it has nothing to do with you
what are you talking about i saw you let a runner go i saw you logan tell me
i did not do anything francis they have made us believe that
why did you do that
no holly wait he is running tell them the rest
and he was hunting the first one this one was not he was not he this one was running the other one was hunting him
yes oh yes he was after you i remember you are running
i am mary 2
where do you live mary
i am very smart
when do you go up
i never go upstairs you are a nice old lady
please no
you prefer women
nothing i felt sad i put myself on the circuit it was a mistake
sad what made you sad
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight now he is gone
yes probably he was renewed
he was killed
killed why do you use that word
is not it right is not that what you do kill
i never killed anybody in my life sandmen terminate runners who brought you
nobody i felt sad i put myself on the circuit
you felt sad that is your name
i thought i had to do something
and now
how a sandman lives
not about that
i am listening
i am afraid to tell you
i am not armed well
why is it wrong to run
you should not even think such things and you picked a strange person to say them to
i suppose but what if you want to live
so do what everyone does try like hell for renewal
i did not say that i would run i just
are you a 5 or a 6
six i go red next year
you are years away i do not know why you are thinking of these things much less talking about them want to try
but i was not sure you would come
here i am shall i come in
i am the most beautiful woman you have ever seen i suppose
maybe sure
thanks but i have the choice
of course
then it is still no
you know
i do not believe you there has to be more
all right
i am going to run
why tell me
you know something
about running dying what
both running s what i am interested in
i know what everyone knows try like hell for renewal you have the same chance everyone else has
it is different now help me
how can i
a runner gave it to me
and then you killed him right
i let him go believe me
i do not
speak to your friends for me jessica please
please what friends
i do not have much time
i never heard of a sandman running ever
and i never heard of sanctuary
what do you need
that is tomorrow
i wish i could help you
maybe you will think of something
i wish i knew what you think i know
of course
if you trusted me you would know
we are coming to arcade shall we relive together
you are not going are you
why not maybe she will help me you will not you would better stay here
that is nice
maybe they are angry because they are grown in meccano breeders
instead of what nine months inside a woman we are all raised the same but most of us do not become cubs in cathedral
some people say children need human mothering
insane nurseries are better than any mother could be
i am only telling you what i have heard have not you ever wondered what your seed mother was like
uh uh
i have
when did you begin to question lastday
i do not remember exactly except i was a green what would you like to relive logan
let s see how long has it been
but what is this why
where sanctuary can you take me there
logan i do not know where sanctuary is but if i take you to them they will kill you
all right but why i did not kill the runner
yes but they will not know that or care they are hunting you logan maybe me too now
that is nothing there s a sandman behind us too and there will be more soon take me to them
i i cannot
then why do not you leave me go to them explain
no not that either
yes i do not know what else to do with him following us why do you keep running from your
because he is my friend and i do not want to be killed by him or anyone
he is good is not he
will he find us and kill us yes or one of the others you know there s only one place to go now
they will not believe us
i would rather take my chances with them than with francis
they will not listen
you think sandmen will there s no other way for me
we will convince them
how will they know we are coming
they are watching us now they will let us in when they are sure
why jessica you are still a green
it is the only way
some kind of breeding pens i suppose they say people used to breed animals fish anything to eat of course
ycch to kill things and then eat them it must have been a savage world
it is brighter there besides we cannot go back
it does not make any difference anymore
you are really one of us now are not you
you knew that i was not before did not you why did you stay with me
i wanted to and you what made you kill sandmen
i had to i did kill for the first time in my life i killed
because you felt like a runner did not you
it feels like breath it makes everything move your hair is moving
and yours
we will be all right we will
sooner or later we will have to try something
why do not we rest here we know we can eat these
i doubt it
do not ever let go
i will not
do you think he was telling the truth
how would anyone know even if we find it we can never go back
thirty thousand years did not last very long did they
the lifeclocks have no power outside
you know jessica
but i still have the choice
of course
then the answer s yes
yes do you think that is why he looks so sad
beloved husband beloved wife what can all that mean
it could be
he had a mother and father and he knew them
one in a million i suppose
you want there to be one that does not
there has to be i know it exists it has to
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes
we cannot we are going back
to what
i am going to try and tell people what we have seen and
you are lying you will never have the chance to tell anybody anything you will be killed the moment you are seen
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them
things will not change you know that we can live here together logan have a life as long as his together
things change
you want to go back to kill is that it now you will want to kill your own kill sandmen killing s all you ever
and sanctuary
sanctuary is the right to live nothing more but nothing less either
beloved wife
it is part of the hydrogalvanic system the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow
is it inside the city
of course i do not know where i just took them for granted it is our only chance
but there are so many of them do you know each one separately
mother and father said so you know
i do not know
you are both full of secrets like macavity did you steal this
all this all of it
what people
i do not know but it does
that is that
they are put into the ground so they can be visited by the living
at least it is over
we will remember but that is a long time off
where are you going
a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else where is the doctor
i like your face would you mind if doc took a picture i would like him to give your face to somebody else
it is all right with me is he here
my name s holly holly 13 in ancient times they said my number was unlucky do you believe in luck
no look i am in a hurry
for as long as i can remember
what kind of place is this
just a place i suppose who knows
i have always been here
are there any other humans
gracious no
have any other people ever passed through
what makes you think so
my parents thought so mother and father you know
mother and you knew your mother and father
dead they are dead and buried
no i am sorry it is not possible
no no no
did your mother or father ever mention another place
never never ever nothing
of course you can stay this belongs to the people
not yet

what a pity i was hoping you would be here to bury me
more many more
and all alive you say
i promise we will go on as soon as it is light

swat is a lifesaving unit you know
i know
try to remember that
a little exercise in lateral thinking the obvious solution is not always the only solution see you tomorrow
i appreciate your concern let s leave it at that
they recruited me promised me fast advancement
recruited you from where
national marksman competition
with your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers why here
furthest point i could find from new york
you do not like new york
spent my whole life there i just wanted to get out for a while
you would never been out of new york
been to toronto my mother was born there
how did you like toronto
it was okay
you are a real excitable sort are not you
you caught me on an up day how about you how did you end up in san francisco
i grew up in oakland crossed the bay bridge and here i was so you are looking for fast advancement
is there something wrong with that
i am not sure
we could fill it with water
not the ones i am at
i do not really like to drink
you have to it is a tradition
well if i have to i have to
why you like my ass
i do not gamble
you living together
she is back in jersey going to graduate school
explain how that works
she is going to come here when she graduates and then we are gonna get married
she grow up in livingtston too
no no no she is from hoboken
oh city girl do not you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in new jersey
we see each other every couple of months
every couple of months huh
do you really
no actually i think it is fucking crazy i do not know if i could do it
thanks for clearing that up i hear your former girlfriend is going out with greg barnett
where did you hear that
around barnett s tough competition
yeah well that is a sore subject and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage
i think i can handle that one
yeah you think so but it comes up
i think so
i need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so i can cut off his nuts
then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit
so what do i say to this guy
you could say something like tell me what the scumbag s name is maybe we can work something out
what bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off
i am not good at lying
get good at it
it is against my nature
thou shall have no other god before me
thou shall not kill you have killed right
so why would you hesitate to lie to save lives
okay stop
you are a compulsive gambler
i have three words for you ex ac ta
i do
now she is going out with greg barnett
so what do you want an autograph
i do not know why she would pick him over you
still needs work
you are right i will never be as good a liar as you
that is okay that is his style
to run last
to run late
he will be running at the quarter pole
yeah first and second
the jockey
come on russell
we lost
we won
how much you wanna bet
you want to bet on whether you won your bet this is getting sick
about six years my partner took me
is it always like this
occasionally you lose
police corruption it is everywhere
he is cutting down the visibility
and doing a very good job of it
i do not know but i have got to get on there
you are crazy
pull up alongside
bullshit would it have happened to you
maybe there s one thing you have to remember you do not create the situations you can only try to save people from them
i look at it as how many i have saved that is the way you have got to look at it
and what about the ones you do not save
you live with it and they haunt you it does not leave
and what if you cannot live with it
you have got to decide that for yourself
so what do you want to do
that is a chance i gotta take
then we better get moving but there s no way we can get the jewels out of evidence
i am okay korda went down the side of the building
stay put
husband came home found that guy and his wife in flagrante now he is holding her at knife point
which apartment
only that floor
is the hostage injured
do not know she keeps screaming to stay out he keeps screaming to stay out we decided to stay out
well there s a good amount of agreement on that
you do not know shit and i suggest you leave
you do not want to see what i am going to do to her
let me show you something ray
i ai not interested in your life story
because i was partially to blame i was not around as much as i should have been i forgot how to love her
she is the one to blame not me
doing what cleaning toilets
i cannot guarantee you what it will be but i swear on my life i will find you work
and why the fuck would you do that for me
my name s scott roper

macey i know you are tired but can you drop me at the retinal fetish it is on your way
jesus lenny
begging groveling any pathetic behavior at all will that help faith s there tonight and i have got to talk to her
sure lenny the only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love
guy named wade beemer used to be a running back for the rams in 96 and 97
rams that is football right
she still loves me
she thinks you are a bucket of dog vomit trust me on this
she is my destiny
destiny you living in a perfume commercial she is a hard climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride
you will see
what i am saying but you still come out this goofball romantic
it is my sword and my shield macey
no idea
go to the sunset sheraton right now just go go
black jack
blackjack i do not understand
snuff clip it was iris she said she needed my help and i aw jesus mace the sick fucker killed her
are you sure it is real
wants to share
this guy is someone you know one of your squid head contacts
so some psycho wire freak gets to keep running around
you ever wonder why you get beat up a lot
never really thought about it
so that gives you something
it gives me i do not know maybe two hundred people who i know wear
i need to see more get more detail something i feel his presence so strong
yeah i am ghosting pretty bad
it is not your fault
no it does not
because iris knew somebody was after her
so the guy s not a sicko
if he could do that is on that tape he is a sicko
that is where it gets a little strange
and what about the guy that was following me
now you are really getting paranoid
ok he asks about you all the time it is been weeks since you have seen him
s okay i know you still love me
jesus mace
anywhere we will talk about it in the car
this tie does not go with blue
mace the guy had a knife to my throat in my living room relaxing might be right out okay
you better keep a low profile for a while
no shit you got someplace in mind
she wanted to go out to my car something about my car
something in your car
it is in my case okay i am going to open my case
bullet resistant whatever happened to bullet proof
lenny calm down this is what i do
it is okay lenny they would never get here in time anyway
the gas tank s going to go any second
fire s out is not it
you sure
it is the walk something anyway they will run your plates and get your address we gotta keep moving
i cannot tell you you have got to see
uh unh i will not do it
mace i know what you think about the wire but i am asking you to do this it is that important
i see i see the earth opening up and swallowing us all
yeah i know so what do we do
you know what this tape could do if it gets out
i have got a good idea yeah
people finding out seeing that the lapd just flat out executed jeriko one jesus maybe they ought to see
maybe but tonight is probably not the best night come on we are rollin
well look at the plus side
there s a plus side
yeah you gave up your hot tub tape to save me that is real progress for you
it was a tough call
i still cannot square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops
i do not think those cops did iris i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her
how long does it last oh
yeah right blow it open
why did not he just go public with the tape save himself that way
i am not going
whatya mean we are going tran s gonna do her right there unless
it did not stop you from loving them right or understanding them or being able to forgive them
i guess
and it did not stop you from wanting to protect them did it
no it did not
good lenny i can see why the detective gig did not work out come on
no they must have sent it to my beach house by mistake
uh unh
and do what take on his whole posse
i still got one ace to play tran s got what i want and i have got what he wants
exactly that is why it is a make able deal
a cop you want me to trust a cop
no trust me
then we will be right where we are now
yeah right fucked
naw they just have to ask us a few questions for about six hours

but i mean is not he faith s new
sssssh not in front of lenny you may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him
take the tape to the cops
this seems a little sophisticated for them these are not subtle guys
there s more to this whole thing than you think
you really want that on your head
you want to talk about it

i am so sorry kalen
what else can they do
kalen do you have any idea where they take them
we are not supposed to think about it but i dream about it sometimes
you have books kalen you have got to take me there there might be history records something to help us find where the morlocks took
i should not have mentioned it we cannot go there
what kind of stories
about the voice in the darkness about the ghosts
what happened
he came back screaming he never talked about it after that i do not think he even got this far
but you are only a mud carrier
i will be all right you go back to the village and light the fire so we can find our way home
this is it
around here
but there s nothing here
how did you know
what are you
i am the librarian i have always been the librarian
i know you you are an automaton of some sort that
i am called vox now you are eloi
who does not know the morlocks
do you know where they live
i was lucky the others were not
how have you survived so long
can you show us where they live
excuse me
you will live like this forever alone you were meant to help to be with people not like this
i am used to that
last night
send him away
kalen hold on a minute
it frightens you
oh shut up
this is the way in
yes are you sure you want to do this
yes but you have done enough thank you for your help i hope someday people read your books again

why did they built it
the morlocks did not build this
what do you mean
trust me you do not want to see any more
what can i do tell me what to do
go back to the light you were not made for this i was i was made for this moment
i do not understand
i am going to end it alexander as we discussed
i will never forget this
i should hope not alexander make them read my books tell them who they are who they could be
i will
you came underground when the world was ending above and you evolved some into the morlocks and others
no we created the morlocks
as slaves
we make them see what we wish
they survived above became what they are
no they did not survive only to be your food you did that
and who are you alexander who are you to question thousands of years of evolution this is the world now i am fact
it cannot all be like this
why would you let me go back
because the past is immutable frozen dead and you are the past
so you take their best
a man can change his history
after all you have seen after man s entire journey you still believe that
i am a foolish man
i know
does this prove something to you have you made some great stand of which i am unaware
oh you will not be running for long
and why not

so it is astronomy now is it
i have seen it
it is only a machine
let them
i have something for you
do you know you were humming
i was not
somewhere around would 2xy something something
damned if i can keep her out of my equations
tonight s the night
god and i am running late
where is the challenge in that
alex this is your first year as an associate professor you might want to play things a little more conservatively
you sound like my father
i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge
i do not i want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see
you may not like it but this is the world we live in alex little grey men with little grey hats
but should not it be better should not we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this
how romantic
do you have a romantic bone in your body
no i am all bowler hat remember
it hurt me alex very much
then why are you here
that is because i am working you remember that you used to care about your work
i care more about my life and yours
i know that
that is where you are wrong i will change it
you would not believe me
i would
i will tell you what come by for dinner in a week and i will show you
why do not you come to our house instead
i cannot do that
when s the last time you were outside this house or this room
i cannot leave when i am so close
you are dying here do not you see that
i pray to god that in a week you are not here
in a week we will never have had this conversation
good night alex
i am glad
his home
thank you
i do not understand
all right all right here everything
well it seems like a long time but it was not really it is rather hard to explain
some but i mean we are not all so handsome
he is gone to a better place
what makes you say that
then you can speak slowly
i know it is hard to believe but it is true
that machine
allowed me to travel from my time to yours
how long ago
more than 800 000 years
why would you do that
yes or forward into the future i suppose i really should check on the machine see that it has not been damaged
i will take you tomorrow you must have seen a lot on your journey
just a dream you should sleep too you are still not well
i will
thank you
you can see so many here
do not then have stars where you come from
not like this they do not seem so bright with all the city lights i never really noticed them much
good night
then you came to a desert and mountains
all of you
every night
you share dreams that is incredible
we share everything
thank you
and this is your work
i can see kalen s point
want to be a high climber now do you
that is it all for
i do not understand
i mean why do you do it what purpose does it serve
it has no purpose it is just beautiful does everything have a purpose where you come from
most things we are very high on purpose
i am a planner i help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like
how do you decide
you liked it there
oh very learning commerce the arts the whole place was buzzing all the time night and day
did you have fires at night
oh it was most of the time
it sounds like a wonderful place to live
looking back i suppose it was i did not quite realize it at the time but
you know this
over there was fifth avenue and the plaza hotel was there this is the carriage path we are on the carriage path
you lost someone
yes after her death it was intolerable for me here the future had to be better
is it
if you only knew
it is undamaged
yes a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship shape
so you can use it now
yes i suppose so
go back to your own time
i could
kalen we have to get kalen
do you have it
hello mr philby
then if emma turns me down will you marry me
oh i am already swooning
ouch all right wish me luck
tell him to go away
may i get you some
that will be all
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is applied mathematics and engineering am i correct
exactly correct sir
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum
well perhaps i have deviated the tiniest bit
might i ask why
because the assigned curriculum is boring
the advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation a careful evolutionary process not chalkboard parlor tricks
my equations are not parlor tricks
abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical durations even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point
because it is a new way of seeing the world of seeing our place in it
very good now if you will excuse us for a moment
i did
well we are happy you are here come inside
well i guess you would call us new yorkers
new yorkers
i took a different route
new yorkers
no i mean someone considerably older your father perhaps
my father has gone to a better place
i am sorry i did not mean to
of course you are just tired mara will you look after alexander tonight
i suppose so
we do not know
we have to go after them find where
alexander i know you are trying to help but they do not come back
what do you mean
they have gone to a better place
you know that is not true
we choose to believe it
then it is time to change that
we are what we are
we cannot change the day and the night alexander this is the world
dean fulton
young man we have a way of doing things here radical theorizing is not acceptable have i made myself understood
now you are upsetting my fowl please go
that is quite enough kalen
that is it like where you come from
i am are you a climber
kalen right now you need to go up to bed you are exhausting alexander
you will tell me more tomorrow
they are here they are inside the house
no you are safe
they are inside
must be all the exercise i get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb
for our sake i hope not
and you have no idea where he went
no sir
i have no doubt of that i will come by in the morning and we will arrange it goodnight mrs watchit

carlos i never raped a woman
i know i am just saying i understand
did you ever do you have feelings for anna

i do not like starlings
why not
they are extremely aggressive birds plus their habits are rather filthy
the mother sure has her hands full
when i go bird watching it is why i like coming here
it is just a city park
their sound is quite musical
how does it sound
it is hard to describe
i bet you can
it is a bright sound
that was terrific
you should hear the bird
you live around here

not at first you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently any second i thought you would take off and fly
i have to go
do you come here often
my daddy likes me home before dark
it is good to listen to your daddy
not yet
it is my bird book
i have friends
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends
i am not pretty
well not in the common way
it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked most people only notice birds with the brightest colors

i have no idea
i think you do
why do not you just tell me
then you will not mind if i look around
i would
got something to hide
does not everybody
i could get a search warrant
if you could you would have brought one today
who said i wanted to buy it
they grow outside do not they
do you believe in them
i do not know
sure you do he cuts open the wolf s stomach and the girl steps out alive
little red riding hood

i will be asking the questions last night you hear anything unusual screams shouts
i was asleep
i did not say what time the assault occurred
you said last night i went to bed pretty early
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty
i went to bed around seven
i could take you downtown
you could it would be a waste of your time though
i have a passionate girlfriend
that is with the boxes
you are a cop figure it out
i would say you are moving
it is a free country is not it
i count my blessings
well i guess i will be seeing you
fraid not
i am adjusting okay
and your new apartment
apartment s okay
are you taking your medication
it gives me headaches
but you are taking it
you are in
why s that
you do not want to know but he is damaged goods real damaged goods if you know what i mean
yeah mary kay i think i do thanks a bunch for the advice
well mary you are about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe you do know what runs out of a sewer pipe do not you
lovers quarrel
if she is here tomorrow i will fucking kill her
can i ask how old you are
i am twelve
no you are not
i will be in three months i cannot wait i hate being eleven it has to be the stupidest age in the world
a long time ago i was sent far away when they let me come back all my friends were gone
it sounds like you were banished
banished yeah
no thank you

i am sure thank you all the same
that is okay does not matter
do you want me to sit on your lap
they could be finches i do not know we should go before it gets dark

i do not want to hurt my daddy
robin listen to me
you should go home

the job s okay
do i take okay to mean you feel good about working there
i said the job is okay
that is right you did have you made any friends there
i am not running for mr popularity
you seem a little hostile today
that was a joke
no need to call me doctor i am a therapist not a psychiatrist
it is all the same
a diary
that is right
no way
why not
diaries have sent too many guys to prison
i do not understand
ev i dence
oh it never crossed my mind
of course
it was just an idea
bad idea
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect
you think reflection is good
it is very good indeed
how is that
no fucking way
then think about it
i am still thinking about it
i wish you would give it a try
it is okay
but you do not like coming here be honest walter
honest no
good that is an honest answer and why do not you like coming here
honest your cheery personality makes my skin itch
is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch
forget it
maybe it is the way i look or the sound of my name
rosen i do not have a problem with that
because if you did i know a therapist named ryan i also know a therapist named chung
i do not need someone else
i do not feel anything
you have no feelings for your niece
she was born after they put me away how can i have feelings
then why are you talking about this
have to talk about something
what are you afraid will happen
i am not that crazy
do you think you are crazy
if i am not then what the hell am i doing here
why do you think you are here
you know why it is part of the parole deal
is that what you are angry about
talking to you is like riding on a merry go round
that is a marvelous image walter because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around
we have a few more minutes
i mean when will i be normal
we have a lot of work to do
will i ever be normal
i could not say
you could not say
i am afraid not
do you know what normal is
i suppose it is however society defines it
how do you define it
i do not
then how do you know if your patients are getting better
they usually tell me
how do they know
what is your idea of being normal
what is your idea of being a jew
whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you why do not we continue this on thursday
i want to be normal
then go see a therapist who will tell you you are normal
fuck you rosen
i know
you do not know
i know you are frustrated walter but
what did you think would happen
i do not know
what did you want to happen
i do not know
is this the first one
of course it is that is why i am telling you
i want you to calm down
i want to talk about it now
we will talk about it more on thursday
remember when you asked me what my idea of normal was
go home walter
i said i was sorry
i cannot move my patients around to accommodate one person
you mean my problem
if by problem you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes
i do not know
that is not a helpful answer
that is my answer
i am relaxed
close your eyes and let your mind be blank
hey rosen you going to hypnotize me
okay eyes closed mind a blank i am all yours do it rosen
nothing can i open my eyes
no when i say the word pretty when i say the word pleasure what is the earliest memory you see
i do not see
in your mind walter take your time
i see my sister
not so fast
sorry where is she
in my bedroom sleeping
where are you
in my bed too
how old are you and your sister
we are little kids
but roughly how old
i am maybe about six which would make her four
just lying there we are taking a nap
a nap
yes a nap kids do that you ever take a nap rosen
did you and your sister often take naps together
i want you back in your chair right now

i do not like nobody behind my back
i am sorry i should not have been there
this is garbage
i am only asking questions
okay i will tell you what i did just to shut you up i smelled her hair

that is all i just liked smelling her hair
you felt pleasure
i was six years old
i meant later when you two took naps

i smelled her hair that is it i just liked smelling her hair
i feel okay
yeah i am fucking fantastic
i am all right
it is fucking freezing out here
what picture
i am talking about you
no weirder than a sharp young good looking woman working in a lumberyard
that is weird about that
most women would not choose it
guess i am not like most women
i am just quiet
you do not hang out with the other guys
neither do you
they are all assholes
i thought you were a dyke
what do you think
i will buy a plant
k through sixth
does not it get noisy
i like the noise
my place faces a truck street i have got cracks in every window from the shaking
you must hate it
i go backpacking a lot lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two
what about them
they could eat you
yeah they could
i get that impression
so that is your dark secret
why do you want to know
do not you think i should know before we have sex

you are still here
i did not say i did not enjoy it
of course sorry i am such a fucking asshole
no you are not

i suffer from insomnia

when i do sleep i sweat a lot usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming
i sleep like a dead horse anything else
because i like you
the worst
i molested little girls
molested little girls
twelve years in prison is no joke

you should be shocked or do you get off on this shit
hey i am not
depraved my mistake
no never again

yes i want to know
do not be sorry for me i did those things no one else did i am dealing with that
my father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave
why young girls walter

you must hate your brothers
i love my brothers
no you do not

he is half yours partner
he is all yours and i am not your partner
you should have killed her then

i do not buy it
watch me
take him
you are wrong a few minutes more and my transition will be complete even your sword will not be able to affect me then
you do not have a few minutes frost
it is because i am human that i can do this
you are blind
there are other ways to see sit
i did not come here to get my palms read i need something translated
show me
who is lamagra
the vampire god this speaks of his return
yes the vampire apocalypse it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst
how do i stop it
but i just got here
you have been here longer than you think
i am sorry i
you are joking
what happens then
not anymore you have seen one of them you will not be allowed to live after that
do it you will be dead before you can file the complaint
that is ridiculous no one s that powerful
figured they would send someone after you thought i would wait around and see who showed up
you used me as bait
it worked did not it
but he could have
he did not get over it
he is a familiar a human who works for the vampires see this mark
because they are vampire wanna bes if they are loyal if they prove themselves then their masters will turn them
and that is a good thing
for some live forever never get old the ultimate high
preventive medicine
it is war now get the fuck out of the way
you do not know that
what do you see here
he will
how can you tell
the way they move they way they smell
there are worse things than vampires out there
like what
like me
some kind of archive
is not this all a little high tech i thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins
you have been watching too much tv they have got their claws sunk into everything finance real estate politics probably own half of downtown
nothing that will not heal by dawn
serum it is a human hemoglobin substitute
you get used to the darkness
those are not real memories no one has that kind of recall
for your miracle cure
we have got a good arrangement that is all whistler makes the weapons i use them the vampires die end of story
your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card
some it is been slow
you do not look so good
i am just tired that is all we have been up all night
you make it sound like i am already dead
i have been better
how long have we been driving
i do not know i woke up just before you did
we get out of this alive maybe i will take that miracle cure of yours
what are you talking about
i am not leaving without you
you do not understand the thirst
i know take some of my blood
yes you will the human side of you is stronger i know it is
for them but for me
you are a week early
i was in the neighborhood
i was afraid that might happen
maybe it is time to start exploring other alternatives
there s only one alternative to the serum
deacon brought me back
fight him
these are my people now i am one of them
you do not have to be
you do not understand i have killed i have hunted and i have enjoyed it
i do not believe that
you will time is on our side sooner or later the thirst always wins
then what is it
i do not know look at this blood smear
this is purely professional curiosity karen i swear
no problem
just the blood sample from the pericardial sac
jesus karen you are breaking my heart here
you are wrong dragonetti
study him unlock the secrets of his dna he is the key we have been looking for
he is an abomination
the other elders will never let you get away with this
get away from him
my name is abraham whistler this is blade as for our little homunculus here
so that is it you guys just patch me up and send me on my way
you have been listening in the whole time
we were not sure we could trust you
what happens if he does not take the serum
which is why you are here we could use someone with your experience
habit mostly just like this
he killed them
eventually he toyed with them first he made me choose do you understand which order they would die in
i did not he was cruel enough to let me live even gave me a souvenir to remember him by
frost s bodycount keeps rising and i am not getting any younger am i
i will take my chances
their own blood cannot sustain hemoglobin
then vampirism is a genetic defect just like hemolytic anemia
i do not know but the back up generator should have kicked in
none of your fucking business
only kidding
what did i do
you threatened to drive her downtown she has agoraphobia
fear of what
open space she has not been out of this apartment in three years i did not used to think it was real
a little homeopathic cure for the willies

what a fine boy you have jabez how old is he now
almost seven no no he is not seven yet i am sure
well it seems to me i remember when you paid me
you are afraid
afraid of what
of what happens after we die
are you plumb crazy man what do you think happens we are buried that is all
but what becomes of our souls
why do you fret about something that is not there
do not say that i know it is
all right so it is buried with you
what if one has not a soul any more what of that
huh that is that well what about it who cares anyhow
i do and i think you should too
stevens that is all this leading up to you know something come on out with it you know something about me
you have had a lot of bad luck these days and yet it is all so unnecessary when i think of your opportunities
yes of course people forgot or the men who knew about it died you know how these things happen
a pin neighbor stone i am afraid you will have to prick your finger but that is a little pain to a lucky man
yes indeed but not now not for seven years oh i almost forgot what is the date
the seventh day of april
1840 well that will take us to the seventh day of april in 1847
look here now
oh come neighbor stone i would not cut that tree if i were you it means a breach of contract
i do not care
but you should now that you are becoming a father
leave your tongue off of that
you promised me prosperity happiness love money friendship
he ai not dead he is dancing in there
he was
i am through with you
what a headstrong fellow well i guess you are quite prepared to suffer the consequences
i have still a year a year to make up for everything
oh no you violated clause five of our contract and i could collect right now if i chose
not now not now let me make up let me make up
i am afraid that is hardly the sort of security i was thinking of you see there is that promising little fellow your son
no no no not him not my son i would rather go with you right now
about what
are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract
but mr stone i am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience is this your signature
you know darn well it is
gentlemen the prosecution rests
ten throws it is
thank you mr webster
seems like it is my fault mr webster
not at all lad not at all for a good game of horseshoes i would always sacrifice fame and acclaim

rachel banks
a direct one
i have a professional relationship with rachel banks she is the go between for a private investigator i use
i do not know who he is
i am told you had an affair with rachel banks four years ago
told by whom
considering the enormous exposure to which you have subjected this firm i would think you would do best to simply answer my questions
who was that other guy
one of many people who would live a word with you
who are they
you have heard of the national security agency
what do they have to do with this
that is who they are
the nsa
it is a sat tracker
i do not know what that means
like a lowjack but two generations ahead of what the police use it pulses at 230 giga hertz
i do not know what that means
230 giga hertz they use that band for the aquacade spy sat uplinks
i do not know what that means
it means the nsa can read the time off your wristwatch
why are they after me
if i knew they would be after me which they probably are right now bye
wait what do i do
pal you are cooked it is over what you did who you were that is done i would find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow
they are spooks
i do not know what that
exposure they cannot have it they wanna learn what you know and then deal with it
i do not know anything

thanks who are you

the robbery
witnesses said you were there but i notice you did not file a report
a report
a police report
that is cause i was not there
you were not at harrison s department store the night before
i was in the store the accident was outside it was a bus
someone said you spoke to mr zavitz before he died i thought you might know something
about what
about the accident
i am no expert but i am assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused
mr zavitz was in trouble
what kind of trouble
you tell me
i cannot
are you invoking attorney client privilege
i am not his attorney
than why cannot you tell me
because i do not know
i am just trying to determine if mr zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident
than why do not you talk to the bus driver
why so edgy mr dean
somebody took my blender
we would appreciate your cooperation
no sir
was he with anyone
not that i could see
nobody gave you anything
to buy lingerie

thanks tom thanks
actually i have come with good news the corleone family has done you a favor
we know you are a busy man with plenty of enemies we saw the opportunity to do you a favor and we did no strings
no strings
do you gamble
a little that is so thought provoking about that
do you owe markers
maybe two three thousand dollars
our mistake but what does it matter it was our money we do not even expect thanks
you paid off thirty grand i never owed
we will keep it quiet the people who know are trustworthy the committee need not find out
and that is the price of their not finding out
simple be friendly like us not hostile
thanks friend
i do not think that is necessary
yes sir his name is vincenzo pentangeli
is he related to the witness
he is i believe a brother
this meeting is adjourned
this committee owes an apology
the committee is adjourned until further notice
i am going to the market
if you could just give us a list we will pick up anything you want
whose orders are these
mr hagen s ma am
this is my boy and my wife mr john ola of miami
sleeping inside me
does it feel like a boy
yes michael it does
i am sorry about some of the people i had to see today it was bad timing but it could not be helped
it made me think of what you told me once in five years the corleone family will be completely legitimate that was seven years ago
have tom hagen meet me in the harbor house
i wanted to see you before you went back to nevada also the children michael they are here
i am not going to stay long i cannot
there are a lot of things i want to talk to you about things i have been thinking about changes i want to make
i think it is too late for changes michael i promised myself i would not talk about it and i have gone and spoiled it
why too late
tell me michael what really happened with pentangeli
his brother came to help him
i did not even know he had a brother and where is he now
on a plane back to sicily
and that is all he had to do just show his face
kay i told you
goodbye michael
i will not let you leave christ do you think i am going to let you leave
at this moment i feel no love for you at all i never thought that could happen but it has
we will go back tonight bring the children
you have not heard me
who s asking
where can we talk
right here
you said you were klingman
you do not come in here talk to an owner in las vegas like that
you missed my point you are no longer an owner
get out of my hotel
i am alright will you stay home for awhile
there are still things i have to do
well we can all have a nice dinner together tonight how are your eyes
no i meant lose his family
your family how can you ever lose your family
but times are different
not for a few years
you are a great man mr roth i have much to learn from you
however i can help you
the rosato brothers have performed services for you in the past i understand that they are under your protection
we do favors for each other
pentangeli is a dead man do you object
it is always bad for business but you have no choice
then it is done i must choose his replacement it cannot be rosato
of course you must keep control of your family
it means quot the lie quot
except the president of the united states
who had frankie pantangeli killed
why the rosato brothers
i know that but who gave the go ahead
very impressive
jake jake come over here mike i want you to meet jake cohen he manages the casino for us
sure i remember tom from the old days
how is his health
not good
is there anything i can do anything i can send
he appreciates your concern michael and your respect
let him gamble
okay you know he does not have that kind of money
is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in las vegas
i do not
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york
i do not
when do we talk
after dinner
we were all heartbroken at the news but that was not cause to start a war
says who
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died and then you took over and welched
clemenza promised them nothing he hated the sonsuvbitches
they feel cheated
michael you are sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family
your family still carries the name corleone and you will run it like a corleone
and while i feed my family in new york you put the knife in my back in miami
i know that is why i want you to be fair with them
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood
frankie you know my father respected roth did business with him
he did business but he never trusted him
i did not want you to know i was coming you heard what happened in my home
michael yes we was all relieved
in my home in the same room where my wife was sleeping where my children come in their pajamas and play with their toys
michael anything what is it i can do for you
i want you to settle these troubles with the rosato brothers
i was just going to contact you michael we just had a sit downg in fact i just come from there
i want you to settle on their terms
mike i do not understand do not ask me to do that
trust me do as i ask
then why do you want me to lay down to them
frankie roth tried to have me killed i am sure it was him but i do not know yet why
jesus christ michael then let s hit em now while we still got the muscle
i thought we would meet alone
i trust these men with my life they are my right arms i cannot insult them by sending them away
some water
all right then let me say you will pay me because it is in your interests to pay me
keep them alive
it is important
no she is here
sitting right behind you
we worked it all out beforehand
are we going to eat or what
sure on me i got diner s club
forget it i am suddenly without an appetite you are making big trouble carmine
you were not straight with us frankie what else could we do
we could have talked first saved a lot of running around
you was not listening you did not want to talk
do not i look like i am listening
my lawyer went over this beforehand
what assurances do i have that there will be no more kidnapping no more hits
the same assurance we got from you
what if i say shove it
then carmine fucillo and tony blue derosa will need to be fitted for slabs
you want a war
we got no choice
i am talking about italians
what about michael corleone
he supports me
maybe yes maybe no
that is a lucky c note for our new deal
how much more a month
eh five dollars more
in fact reduced bu five dollars
i will not keep you another minute
how are they with kids
they are great with kids they love em they eat em up i am kidding
so this really does the trick eh
they are really white
whoa check it out
nah that is some guy fixing the living room floor
let s watch some tv
where are these toys of yours
a lot of my stuff has not been unpacked yet here s the tv
what toys do you have
i am looking for some perfume
any particular brand
well it is for a woman
wife girlfriend or mother
oh uh girlfriend
oh it is nothing no problem i was really lucky to find this place
actually i have met someone there s a woman i think i like
oh good well i hope you will have more to tell me next time
i am i am really feeling pretty good i have a much stronger sense of how far i have come
as long as you keep remembering why
well we talked about the whole disapproval thing
and please do not for god s sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way
no no no no
that would be monumentally stupid all i am saying is
a sense of proportion
a sense of proportion
who does not
i have cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever
well now do not go creating some artificial environment for yourself
i should
you have to put yourself out there a bit more
maybe i could take a look at it now
yeah that was easy
do you do washing machines too
just show me the way
is not that always the way
so you are just kind of a roving
an occupational hazard i am afraid
i bet going into people s homes
it is a living
uh no i have never really found the time to settle down
you must value your independence
yeah i have always been able to make my way in the world i do not like having to rely on other people
it is nice that you can make that choice
yeah i am okay it is been a long night
what happened
can i tell you tomorrow i think i
uh huh
yeah you know that in life you really have to choose what you want to do
listen i am sorry but it is really late you do not have to come tomorrow to work on the floor
it is tomorrow
i think we should talk first
about us
mr sykes i think you should go home
find a penny pick it up all day long you will have good luck
bye neil
i am thirsty
aw okay
a man scared me
a man was it a dream
uh huh
why are you mad at each other
you know how sometimes neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him
uh huh
well that is what happens with grownups too
did daddy tease you
yes he did and i do not like it any more than you do
holly that is not so
no i told you a whiff of perfume on his shirt
have you just plain asked him
i have asked him that is wrong
i have tried to get him to agree to one i just i do not know i am getting such weird vibes lately
do not drive yourself crazy it is probably nothing
he will never appreciate it more
we do not want to be late for our first day of school
because you would have to get up at five a m would you like that
i could take a cab on the way home
here take this out to the table
no honey i have not seen him did not you feed him this morning
i cannot help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone much bigger than me
i think we got it just in time before the ink dried
thanks mom
i do not know how it started
he is staying with a friend hurry up now you will be late for school
mom there s somebody in the house
no thanks mom i will go up to bed now
do you want me to come up and tuck you in
that is okay mom
neil do not leave the back doors open i do not want holly near the pool
we would have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool
that is that
this is the one for us
stop knowing me so well
i know it is at the high end of our range
high end honey it is a whole new budget
but it is what we want
you wanted furniture too did not you
they do not expect to get what they are asking let s make an offer
it is a nice pool is not it
and it is a shorter commute
it will be even shorter if i get that new job come on
it is very nice but it is still a little pricey for us
paul newman in the hustler
good that is what i was trying to project
honey are you okay
and keep my kids away from his property who the hell does he think he is some nice neighborhood
honey the meeting today is going to be fine do not get in an uproar
i know it is just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me
it is just a dumb game they play you want to be at a bigger firm get used to the politics
oh great
well did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job
no if i hear anything you will be the first to know all right
all new houses have noises
how long does it have to be a new house
he is made some friends has not he
i know someone else who s sensitive
what next a strange bra under my pillow

that is not a decision for you to make on your own
this is my house
yeah we know him he is been hanging around the house
we will talk in the morning
not very long there have been a couple of bids already
because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings
sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment
this is a terrific entrance hall what a welcoming feeling
is not it
oh space you said the right thing
how large is your brood
two three if you count the husband
we must always count the husband by my count there have been four but i still live in hope
shut up

these records only go back to 1880 but wait a minute
what was her name
it might have been her mother
we do not have proof of that
suppose not
what will they tell you
i will be able to do a search to find out who lived here previously and who died here
thank you if you told me two years ago we would be living here i would never have believed it do you live around here
no i live about in wexford it is about a five hour drive
so was i the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not
well i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us
yes it was
why do not you pass me your plate
a few years older perhaps
how is your arm
i am sorry
there s no need to be
good bye
that poor little girl
it is origin is unknown the symbol does correspond to a dagger i acquired many years ago
by killing them
by freeing them
i do not understand
the knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed
pearl is the twilight the divinity onyx is the sickle death
well i bet you they are happy
we will have every leprechaun in ireland here honey
i did not do anything mommy
well then who did
maybe it was colleen

yeah i will look into that tonight
i hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service
the place is pretty dusty
well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it was not i will have to call her
who knows we have to get used to living around here maybe good help is hard to find
must be
will maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while
oh come on
i just i do not know
what will aubrey think
aubrey knows more about us than you think
look i thought we were all right on this maura it is over you know that
whatever you say
to our family
did anyone in your family keep in touch with her
i do not think she willed it to me out of sentiment she did not even know who i was it is just tradition
i do not know that is strange
she is asleep i think that is what i need too i am starting to see things
yeah well i will be joining you shortly i just want to
were you fooling with the power
it was in the cellar weird
well something just happened to the power upstairs maura heads off and shakes her head troubled by the event
so what are you saying
i do not know what i am saying
yeah i would say some weird things have happened
well what do you think it is
maybe eliza was not so crazy after all
oh come on
what about keeping an open mind
i am sure this sounds crazy to you
are you ok
she has a friend colleen
a friend
you an imaginary friend that is what she calls her
i think everything s ready
good i will start bringing things in
she is gone
aubrey aubrey
you seem to appreciate the local scenery
no you two are the most important things in my life i do not ever want to lose you
know what
what are you talking about
we are not going
not going are you out of your mind wait
no no
i am ok
i am all right
well that is what we are here for i mean
i could see if i detect the presence of something
we are usually successful in detecting the source of most problems unfortunately
what do you mean unfortunately
we usually find nothing we have debunked many a reported haunting about ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation
what about the other five percent
she is at school we have tried not to upset her more than she is been
if we have a troubled spirit here we have to find out why it is troubled
you will have to settle for turkey
white meat will be fine
yes i am
oh that is nice
may i come in
did you know her very well
it was a shame
in her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here she would call me and i would come by
i took pity on the poor woman this house is too big for one person to live alone in
aubrey it is mommy
come back to us honey do not be afraid
come back to us honey
and you are
how can i help you
well i believe her mind was playing tricks on her god rest her soul she would hear things see things
well thank you for the offer but i really have to go
thank you
perhaps i will see you in church
good night
the amulet
did you remove anything in the cellar
we must return it if you want your daughter back
what are you getting at
it will not take long
it cannot hurt you if you are not afraid aubrey think about us we are here for you we love you
yes it is will and seamus look at each other
i do not know what happened and i do not know what you did
i did not do anything god saved her
that is going to happen
yes they are
we will be there
well we could bring in special equipment monitors sound devices things like that
so is that what all this is someone have a problem with us living here
not someone something i have never felt a presence that strong before
not really oh wait a minute
it was nailed to the cellar wall
i see some faint lettering it appears to be the runic alphabet
not at all if it can help
well what is it
i do not know trust what i am saying we have to open this wall
your lips they did not move
they did but too fast for you to see them no magic just grace and speed
we had feared we were the only ones
but how did you come into existence
if there were a leader i would be the one
ah you have questions
what are we
nothing if not vampires
who made us what we are
surely you know the one who made you
but the one who made him who made the one who made him the source of all this evil
you mean we are not children of satan
then god does not exist
i have not spoken to him
and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil
you fell too much so much you make me feel
he knew nothing he just did not care
knew you mean he is
listen to me
your lover
no my beloved my child
if you say so you are innocent
i am not innocent but i am afraid she feels she is in danger from the others
she is
but why
i could give you reasons her silence her youth it is forbidden to make so young so helpless that cannot survive on its own
then blame the one who made her
did you kill this vampire who made you both is that why you will not say his name santiago thinks you did
we want no quarrel with him
it is already begun if you want to save her send her away
then i leave too
you said there were none
but you asked the wrong questions do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality how quickly they perish of their own will
we can do that
how he must have loved you
like moths around the candle of the age decadent useless they cannot reflect anything but you do you reflect its broken heart
yes my god
yes i knew him knew him well enough not to mourn his passing
follow me that way through my cell
i cannot save her
you cannot believe i would leave without her armand you must save her you have no choice
louis i cannot save her i will only risk losing you
i do not believe you i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie
louis they cannot be brought back there are some things that are impossible even for me
you let them do it
louis i swear i did not
i knew i rescued you did not i from the terrible dawn
you were their leader they trusted you
you made me see their failings louis you made me look at them with your eyes
what a pair we are we deserve each other do not we
we are a pair and that is what counts
it is bet in the beginning lest the death takes you down with it yes that is it my child my beloved child
what night what do you mean
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year
i did not realise
is this my birthday
i have or there would be twice as many
but you are the fairest by far
you dress me like a doll you make my hair like a doll why
what you are you would be something other than you are
and if i cut my hair again
it will grow back again
stop her louis
did you do it to me
be glad i made you what you are you would be dead not if i had not
does it
yes and i will tell you something else i have met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you
is that supposed to frighten me
you are spoilt because you are an only child you need a brother or i do i am weary of you both
i suppose we could people the world with vampires the three of us
not you my dear
you are a liar but you upset my plans
what plans
i came to make peace with you even if you are the father of lies i want things to be as they were
oh lestat i must do more than that i have brought a present for you
then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess
drunk on brandy wine a thimblefull i thought of you when i saw them
we forgive each other then
no laudanum
louis put me in my coffin
i will put you in your coffin forever
what have you done
the way i learn everything by watching you
lestat taught you all you need to know about that
infant death he calls me sweet daughter death you know what he calls you merciful death
he jests
why does he call you that
hush claudia do not talk about such things show me your book
sit still it is not finished
claudia do not
why not
tell me why you have got to tell me
and it means something else too does not it i shall never ever grow up
i took your life he gave you another one
he will never let us go
do not mock me louis help me
the one good lesson he taught me louis never drink from the dead
do not mock claudia
the swamp
then maybe so do we every night of our lives he was my brother my maker he gave me this life whatever it is
i did it for us louis so we could be free
i cannot go away from me
and you never cried
i cannot bear it when you do i would die rather than lose you louis i would die the way he died
tell me you do not hate me louis i did it for you
the workmen must have a trunk do not stop cherie
it is take the back stairwell
not yet
still my beautiful child
it was something hurries and seldom savoured something acute that was quickly lost it was the pale shadow of killing
but how will i ever know louis
claudia you torture yourself
they are ducklings that will grow into swans whereas i must be the duckling forever
you are more beautiful than any of them
you are neither claudia now stop this
yes should i take her louis among her dolls make a doll of her in turn
come claudia
nonsense all right but something tell me it is going to be the strangest nonsense we have ever seen
they are here i know they are listen for something that does not make a sound
how devilishly clever
no she is frightened she does not know where she is
and no one knows but us
yes and very beautiful
be still
i can feel it from them they want to know who made us what became of him they have their rules their idiotic rules
no you would not louis danger hold you to me
love holds you to me and we are in danger not you
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word when he put me in that trance
so you felt it too
let him go he said let him go
you really believe that
do not make me claudia i cannot do it
but if she dies
it is only mortal death
what do you mean
then my luck would have changed
you want death is it death you want
and a beautiful house it is too yours is a good life is not it
why should i be
i have come to answer your prayers you want to die do not you life has no meaning anymore does it
give it to me
vampires we thrive on blood
i want it
how do you mean start
call him
i cannot do it
you have just done it
kill me if you will but i cannot do this
i wish i were but if i were what would i want with you
i cannot go through with it i tell you
your perfect your bitter and you are strong
but why do you want me
because you are as strong as i was when i was alive
yes kill me kill me like you promised
you asked for death i did not promise it
i want a woman
the crucifix
forget the crucifix take him
you have fed you were made for this
you have killed louis and enjoyed it
it cannot be
and if i do not
the sun will destroy the blood i have given you every tissue every vein the fire in this lantern could do that too
do you think so
we can live like this off the blood of animals
anything is possible but just try it for a week come into new orleans and let me show you some real sport
of course not it is so easy you almost feel sorry for them
read her thoughts
i cannot
the dark gift is different for each of us but one thing is true of everyone we grow stronger as we go along
i do not know any hell
paris you came from paris
as did the one who made me
tell me about him you must have lernt something from him it had to happen for you as it did for me
i learnt absolutely nothing i was not give a choice remember
but you must know something about the meaning of it all you must know where we come from why we
come the new orleans then there s an opera on tonight a real french opera we can dine in splendour
i respect life do not you see for each and every human life i have respect
respect me a little then i am the only life you know
where do you think my idiot friend we are in a nice filthy cemetery does this make you happy is this fitting and proper enough
and what if there is no hell or they do not want us there ever think of that
i do not pretend to know
vampires are killers predators who s all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment
i know let her alone
you finish her if you feel so much
in the old world they called it the dark gift louis and i gave it to you
oh god lestat i felt peace i felt an end to the craving
that and more
ah but we have even more in common with our creator come i am like a mother tonight i want a child
what are you saying
you need company louis more congenial than mine
i did not want to kill her
do not worry louis you are conscience is clear you left her alive
lestat what do you mean
that is enough cherie stop before the heart stops
you are the devil you are the instrument of satan
shhhh do you want to frighten our little daughter
she would sleep in my coffin daily curl her child s fingers round my hair as she dreamt of i know not what
louis louis i gave you the gift help me
are you mad
do not try to speak it is alright
i did not mean to let them do it that santiago he tricked me
that is all past lestat
yes past she should never have been one of us
do not fear me lestat i bring you no harm
you have come back to me louis you have come again to me
i cannot bear it louis the machines out there that fly and that roar and such lights they make the night brighter than the day
and they frighten you
you know i love the dark but there s no dark anymore
it is false light lestat it cannot harm you
if you stayed with me louis i could venture out little by little become the old lestat
you remember how i was louis the vampire lestat
yes i remember
so much the better i have got a pocket full of tapes
you followed me here did not you
saw you in the street outside you seemed interesting is this where you live
it is just a room
so shall we begin what do yo do
i am a vampire
absolutely i was watching you watching me i was waiting for you in that alleyway and then you began to speak
well what a lucky break for me
perhaps lucky for both of us
yes but you need not worry about that now things change
we cannot begin this way let me turn on the light
but i thought vampires did not like the light
we love it i only wanted to prepare you
why should i lie 1791 was the year it happened i was twenty four younger than you are now
oh that rumour about crosses
you cannot look at them
nonsense my friend i can look on anything i like and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes
the story about stakes through the heart
the same as you would say today bull shit
what about coffins
coffins coffins unfortunately are a necessity
can a vampire feel love
you loved your wife surely
he did it to make you stay with him
how could i not she had to know
and did you lose her did she go
where would she have gone she was a child and beautiful heartbreaking merciless child and i had made her that
he was dead to us we were free that was all that mattered
fictions my friend the vulgar fictions of a demented irishman so we repaired to paris
he had not even been there and all those years i thought he was dead
but it has there is no more to tell

i need to ask you questions of a psychological nature
remember when you asked for a study on him i refused same goes for now
that was peterson upstairs
it was you who did the asking
he does not think you run mind games on him
i would not presume to try
if he pushes too deep into our boy s mind set he may destroy himself what are you planning jack
could he handle a direct contact
i do not recommend it
kevin and molly are on their way to montana who the hell is he to do this to my family sidney answer me that
right what about sweating lecktor
he would know it from articles he is read about lecktor
twenty minutes max
that could be the tip of a t here and here and here
at the end is the tail of what could be an r
when do they go to press
one hundred prayers could be the page number the paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter but what book
not the bible
no galatians 15 2 galatians has only six chapters the same with jonah 6 8 jonah has four chapters lecktor was not using a bible

you are his friend jack why cannot you leave him alone
because it is his bad luck to be special
he thinks you want him to look at evidence
nobody s better with evidence but he has the other thing too he does not like that part of it
you would not like it either if you had it
no i do not like people who park in the handicapped zone
i will try to keep him as far away from it as i can

the report did not mention nails and eyes
why do you think he took his gloves off

hi andy how is the weather up there
oh you know the bay area always foggy
oh no did he get hurt
there will be other shots
but was not it funny
funny i dunno but intriguing mindboggling perhaps headache inducing sure like that moment when you both came onstage
no i am not gonna take it if i take it i will break my back
wrong you have not given them any clues that it is a parody
that is because they have only seen it once but i will do it again and again and again they will catch on
andy you do not get it they do not want you back
andy it is me i have got some crummy news taxi s been canceled
andy they do not think you suck they have just lost a reason to love you
that is ridiculous you do not even smoke
i i got some freaky rare kind it is called large celled carcinoma

i wanna go back to work and put on a happy show the best show anybody s ever seen
do you wanna tour the clubs

sure comedy make jokes about the traffic do impressions maybe a little blue material
i do not swear i i do not do what everyone else does
well everyone else gets this place cookin pal it is hard for me to move the booze when you are singing pop goes the weasel
no that is not an audience that is plaster an audience is people made of flesh they live and breathe got it
but it is funny it is a practical joke they will get frustrated
but it is only for thirty seconds
do you wanna wrestle it is a good way of breaking the ice that instant physical intimacy really brings two people together
no no no it is not sex i mean it can lead to sex but really it is just wrestling
i do not wanna talk about it
i mean uh the colors in the sky are so vibrant i love this time of day
buzz off go patronize somebody else

goals are important
i stopped drinking i gave up drugs and i am meditating three hours a day it is the center of my life
we are all impressed
yes your holiness
why i i attend every year
yes we do not doubt your devotion to tm but we feel that perhaps you and the program have grown apart philosophically
it is apparently not working
so help me all i wanna do is meditate
andy do not raise your voice we do not wish your presence here
are you sure
it is probably just a strained muscle
doctor i think i need a neck brace
eh sure we are trying to expand our audience base and i know the college kids really love andy kaufman
yeah yeah yeah i know wink wink nudge nudge
no i am serious if you book tony do not expect to get andy
i will take my chances
why s that you said over and over and over tony clifton is not andy kaufman

and you are
smith i am agent smith
you all look the same to me
lieutenant you were given specific orders
i am just doing my job you gimme that juris my dick tion and you can cram it up your ass
the orders were for your protection

it is choi
i know it is her fault
two grand
if you get caught using that
i know i know this never happened you do not exist
i do not know my computer
all the time it is called mescaline and it is the only way to fly
i know but i felt like taking a shift
we are going to kill him do you understand that he is going to die just like the others
morpheus believes he is the one
i it does not matter what i believe
you do not do you
if you have something to say i suggest you say it to morpheus
i intend to believe me someone has to
hear what
yeah course i am sure
do not tell me you are a believer now
i just keep wondering if morpheus is so sure why does not he take him to the oracle she would know
morpheus will take him when he is ready
cypher where is tank
he had an accident
an accident
you killed them
do not hate me trinity i am just the messenger and right now i am going to prove it to you
he is going to pop
what are you doing
midnight watch
the matrix yeah
how many were there
five since i have been here
what happened to them
dead all dead
any time
i got you
just get me outta here
nearest exit is franklin and erie an old appliance store
are they any agent
shit apoc
what if he is not the one morpheus how can you be so sure
they will be able to track it
we have no choice
he is beginning to believe
five minutes maybe six
i know trinity do not worry he is going to make it
stand up and see for yourself
right now
yes now
i am not sure but if you do not want to find out you better get out of there
but what if
go now
how do you know all this
there s a small ledge it is a short climb you can make it
the agents
they got to you first but they have underestimated how important you are if they knew what i know you would probably be dead
what do you know
it is an honor
please come sit
you could say that
you are morpheus you are a legend most hackers would die to meet you
yes thank you but i think we both know there s more to it than that do you believe in fate neo
because i do not like the idea that i am not in control of my life
i know exactly what you mean
do you want to know what it is
this cannot be
be what be real
far from it
your muscles have atrophied we are rebuilding them
you have never used them before
more important than what is when
wild is not it
i did not say that it would be easy neo i just said that it would be the truth
for what
your training
show me
you you are too fast
do you think my being faster stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place
because i did not think i would
your mind makes it real
the body cannot live without the mind
what what lesson
i think i do
no you do not did you see the woman in the red dress
no neo i am trying to tell you that when you are ready you will not have to
that is going on
yes she is very old she is been with us since the beginning
the beginning
of the resistance
and she knows what everything
she would say she knows enough
how does she know
do not think of it in terms of right and wrong she is a guide neo she can help you find the path
she helped you
that i would find the one
yes i do
yeah what about the other five guys the five before me what about them
trinity go get to the basement find the catch basin
ten hours straight he is a machine
i need the main wet wall
we need an exit
got one ready sir subway state and balbo
we are on our way
yes sir
do it
you are the oracle
what vase
shit i am sorry
how did you know
honestly i do not know
but what
but you already know what i am going to tell you
i am not the one
sorry kid you got the gift but looks like you are waiting for something
morpheus he almost had me convinced
i know poor morpheus without him we are lost we will never find the one
what do you mean without him
how do you know that name
i know a lot about you i have been wanting to meet you for some time
who are you
my name is trinity
trinity the trinity the trinity that cracked the i r s kansas city would base
that was a long time ago
gee zus
most guys do
no it is safe here and i do not have much time
right now all i can tell you is that you are in danger i brought you here to warn you
of what
they are watching you neo
who is
what is the matrix
it is necessary neo for our protection
from what
from you
we think you are bugged try to relax
it is going into replication
easy neo easy
it disables any electrical system in the blast radius it is the only weapon we have against the machines
that the matrix cannot tell you who you are
but an oracle can
that is different
is it
are you worried
should i be
she told me
right as rain
nothing just had a little deja vu
what happened what did you see
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it
how much like it was it the same cat
it might have been i am not sure
a deju vu is usually a glitch in the matrix it happens when they change something
we have to

he would not just turn himself in it does not make any sense
you are wound too tight mills let it go
ease back mills
i am in
announcing what
there are seven deadly sins gluttony wrath greed
so what this victim
envy sloth pride and lust seven
this cannot be my last duty here it will go on and on
everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible also this should not be his first assignment
no i have not heard
there was a second
i thought you might want to be filled in
i am sure everyone s doing their best
i will get a job maybe on a farm i will work on the house
cannot you feel it yet cannot you feel that feeling you are not going to be a cop anymore
what are you talking about
you know
i have no understanding of this place anymore
it is always been like this
he is not finished
i can breathe withour pain now so i guess i feel great
we figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house
yeah that is true
it would be too hard
i read about it in the paper
i will see you
where was the girl
what what
where was the prostitute where was she
who tied her down you or him
turn around hands on your head
what the hell s going on
who are you what are you doing out here
i am i am just delivering a package
put it down put it on the ground
i mean at this point what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself
it does not matter who i am who i am means absolutely nothing you need to turn left here at the traffic light
it is not too far away now
david please
i visited your home this morning after you left
her pretty head
you will see
not me i am not special i am not exceptional this is though what i am doing
in two months no one s going to even remember this happened
spit it out
murderers like you
you should be thanking me
and why is that
and i remember breaking your nose you are only alive because i did not kill you
sit back
it is close
what the fuck is going on here
shut up
what the fuck is going on
i want you to know i wish i could have lived like you do
since we are just starting out i thought we could go to a bar sit and talk for awhile after that we will
i meant to ask you something mills when we spoke on the phone i cannot help wondering why here
i i do not follow
all this effort you have made to get transferred it is the first question that pops into my head
maybe i am not understanding the question
i was not standing around guarding the local taco bell i have worked homicide for five and a half years
not here
i realize that
well over the next seven days do me the favor of remembering it
for now
no one yet
is there any blood in it
i do not know feel free to look for yourself okay
guessing at this point is useless
okay sure it is just that with my old partner you know
i just do not think we should have that sort of relationship we would start quarreling over insignificant things
have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink near the food
but why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing it must have been intentional
this is a premeditated puzzle and it is only the beginning
whoa whoa what
can we talk about this in private
detective mills here honey i asked you not to call me here i will call you back what why
how is that
what about sports
what about them
i read remember reading
i just have to say i cannot respect any man who s never seen green acres
i vaguely recall a large angry man and someone called norton
i am certain he was the biggest defense lawyer around infamous actually
look i appreciate being able to talk this out but uh
this is just to satisfy my curiosity i am still leaving town saturday
we put her in a safe house
did you read them
yeah parts of them anyway in purgatory dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain seeing all these other guys who sinned
seven terraces of purgation
right but there pride comes first not gluttony the sins are in a different order
attrition when you regret your sins but not because you love god
like because someone s holding a gun on you
none which i do not understand he had to get back out
i know
even if they did those photos were taken before forensics
a switchblade
we are screwed he is fucking with us
just wait
it does not fit he does not want us to help him stop
and you do not
i wish i still thought like you
then you tell me what you think we are doing
i have seen the same i am not the country hick you seem to think i am
does not seem like our man does it
you tell me i am new in town
he does not have the desire somehow our killer seems to have more purpose more purpose than victor could ever conceive of
the fingerprints
yes they were there so it must be
we will tag along
satisfy our curiosity
call an ambulance
i want him bad i do not just want to catch him anymore i want to hurt him
listen to me he is all about playing games
no kidding no fucking kidding
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here no matter how hard it is we have to stay focused on the details
i do not know about you but i feed off my emotions
he will string us along all the way if we are not careful
they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well
sorry about that i just
oh it is alright
who pays the rent on time
this is the job it is not an easter egg hunt
oh blah blah blah the guy s insane
it is a fine line between insane and inspired
yes we do here
well he is been right so far has not he
just because the bastard has a library card it does not make him einstein
i do not know like fifty
let s go
it is be best if you got to the point cause i am about ready to punch you in the face
what assessing fines
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable communism to violent crime
how is this legal
legal illegal these terms do not apply i do not applaud it
yeah well at least we are out of the office we have got pizza
how do you know all about this
i do not neither do you
we are focusing
i know i know focusing on one little thing
the divine comedy a history of catholicism a book called murderers and madmen
it is not what you think it is
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism
that is
the writings of saint thomas aqu aquin
saint thomas aquinas he wrote about the seven deadly sins
that is what it says jonathan doe
this is stupid it would be just too easy
we will take a look at him talk to him
sure uh excuse me are you by any chance a serial killer oh you are well come with us then if it is okay
you do the talking put that old silver tongue of yours to work
who told you about my silver tongue you been talking to my wife

think about how we got here
no point in arguing anymore
we had him
i am trying alright just tell me what we have got
then he must write about these murders
these murders are his masterwork his sermon to all of us to all us sinners
if we get him i will be happy enough
no face it now stop thinking it is good guys against bad guys
how can you say that especially after today
do not try to focus on things as black and white because you will go blind there s no winning and losing here
you are the oldest man i know somerset
where is the victory
you follow the law and do the best you can it is all there
what the fuck is wrong with you what burnt you out
call for help and you will live but you will be disfigured or put yourself out of your misery

must have been hard being poor
i am still poor
hmmm but consuelo even though your poor do not you have any hobbies or interests or anything
no mikey
but like what do you like to do when you are not working
i am always working
but when you are not like now what do you like to do
this is work
but it is not like real work this is just babysitting
mi jesus…mi jesus…
speak english
mi jesus esta muerto
consuelo i am sorry but you know if you do not speak english i cannot understand you
my jesus…
who is jesus
my baby
you have a bay
my grandchild baby
gee i did not even know you had any children but why are you so upset about jesus
he is dead
oh how did it happen
he was executed he was on death row and then he was executed
how did they execute him
poison gas
maybe he was and you just did not know it
he was not
but still you cannot be sure
i am sure
but really you never know
i know
why was he on death row
for rape and murder
it is when you love someone and they do not love you and then you do something about it
well then when you get older you can do something about it
you are showing how superior you are to your subject toby no but i like my subject i like these people
no you do not
yes i do i love them
thanks i will tell mike well it is still just a beginning i know i can dig deeper
you think so you do not think that this might not be a little dry
i mean without this footage without this rigorous documentation it would feel like exploitation
no no no no exploitation this is serious…but do not you find it a little funny too at the same time
you have got a family tragedy on your hands will you tell me that is funny about that about a kid in a coma
nothing i guess…
i mean why are you making this documentary if you cannot treat your subject with appropriate gravity
we are not ready
hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
we are not ready
well i need to see this with an audience
that is an audience going to tell you
i do not know maybe they will like it
i am serious what happens if he blows up the school
i was looking through scooby s sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests guess what score i got
got a lot of homework
do not worry he does not mean money
you know you have to sometimes you just have to toby
look we are not suckers everyone else is out there doing the same thing
he is right
is everything ok
my cd case like totally collapsed i am gonna have to recatalogue all weekend hey can you pass the salad over
i dunno
how was the class
that is tomorrow
the sats knucklehead scooby i am not taking them
you mean again
well i changed the ending a little
oh what happens now
well actually it is the same but longer i think it is better more raw
well then maybe you should just read the ending
but it will not make any sense if you hear it out of context
i think you should leave it the way it was it was good
you will read it in class tomorrow surprise me anyway i have to go i promised melinda i would help her with her oral
marcus i am tired that is all
you have lost interest you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex
i was never much of a sweater you know that
do not be so upset it is ok
what the fuck are you talking about that is ok
you know he hated my story also
your story was terrible
well i sure did not hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered
you are absolutely right the focus is on the college admissions process today
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds
oh well i do not have them yet but –
yeah how do we know we will not be exploited
i have a cousin very big giver to the alumni fund
whaddya mean you do not know you either got a lot or you do not that is not to know
the same
the same same as what
just the same
man it is just like conversation
maybe he is building a bomb just like
yeah well mikey listen up cause here s a lesson life s not fair
one in a million recover
maybe he is that one in a million
mikey there s optimism and then there s stupidity it is a very fine line
yeah sure go ahead hypnotize me

liquid metal
we have to leave the city immediately and avoid the authorities

negative the t 1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there
you sure
i would
anything it samples by physical contact
no only an object of equal size
it cannot form complex machines guns and explosives have chemicals moving parts it does not work that way but it can form solid metal shapes
oh great and what happens to her
terminated shit why did not you tell me we gotta right now
negative she is not a mission priority
yeah well fuck you she is a priority to me
you told me to
that is one of my mission parameters
prove it stand on one foot
of course i am a terminator

a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell
hasta la vista baby
yeah or later dickwad or if someone gets upset you say chill out like that or you can do combinations
chill out dickwad
that is great see you are getting it
no problemo
it is in your nature to destroy yourselves

you mean people i do not know we just cry you know when it hurts
pain causes it
uh unh no it is different it is when there s nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway you get it
no problemo
i guess yeah oh shit
drive faster
the t 1000 has the same files that i do it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson s house
i do not care we have gotta stop her
killing dyson might actually prevent the war
i do not care there s gotta be another way have not you learned anything have not you figured out why you cannot kill people

open the goddamn door
ballistic penetration shocks it but only for a few seconds
so do you

i am sure it feels very real to you
you think you are alive and safe but you are already dead everybody you him everybody you are all fucking dead
on all what
on furtwängler
i do not know
major arnold believes he has a moral duty too
that is right i was raised very strictly so do not speak before you are spoken to
oh and do not wave your hands about
respect your elders and your betters
and no elbows on the table
eating is eating and
and talking is talking well i think we better get on
i do not know
but i promised your mother
i do not know but you and i already know that he has saved lives
for chrissakes i hate that shit cut it out
i am very sorry
i am steve that is your name
david david wills i am your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural affairs committee sir
sounds a lot of run so they sent the big guns to check up on me we recruiting children now
i guess so sir
you call me sir again and i will make you listen to beethoven
i guess it is possible
so what does the russki want
colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you
dim shits
major richards said he would call to let us know
that is big of him
five minutes
it is a bet you are the witness emmi
yes what was the orchestra s reaction when they asked you to play for hitler s birthday
why not show dr furtwängler the evidence it may refresh his memory
david what are you counsel for the defence now did you hear the question
you bet
and totally irrelevant
with more what more what
major he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect
david i do not understand a thing about you you are a jew are you a jew
yes i am a jew but i like to think first i am a human being
what is it with you david where are your feelings where is your hatred your disgust where is your fucking outrage david
colonel pleasure
so major tell me have you questioned dr furtwängler
not yet
i have had two meetings with him he is a great musician maybe the greatest conductor in the world his brahms beethoven schubert unequalled
we are dealing with degenerates here
do not talk about things you know nothing about he was in a dictatorship
yeah yeah art and politics yeah yeah i heard all about that
there are good party members who help and there are dirty non party members who inform on you of course they gave him privileges
let furtwängler go please
i have a duty
then you are going to kill me
three months
says here because of your father that is that mean
my father was one of the officers in the plot against hitler they arrested the plotters and their families
your mother too
yes she suffered longer she was in ravensbruck
and your father was executed
oh yes major i have recordings of all his symphonies i kept them safe during the bombing my favourite is the seventh symphony
mine s the eleventh
but he only wrote nine major
i am kidding emmi what about a record player you have that too
no ours was damaged
that is in those files
the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires major what am i to tell dr furtwängler
come in emmi this is your office too emmi this is lieutenant david wills
shut the door emmi sit down emmi we are going to keep him waiting too
do you know where the adagio begins
of course
put it on ready to play and i will tell you when to play it
what is this emmi
i cannot do this it is not right
that is not right
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that just like you questioned him
i did not conduct at at the rally i conducted on the evening before the rally
how come
could i have a glass of water please please fraulein
i do not buy that
it is the truth
i do not remember in detail there were so many
did you call someone you knew
i may have as as i said i simply do not remember
may i ask a question
your guess is as good as mine
i need to work i need to make my living i live off the generosity of friends
tough tough
it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me
why were they going to arrest you
i believe it was because of another letter i would written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies
you did not complain about the racial policies just about the musical standards is that right
it would be truer to say i think that a lot of people in high places knew me
i have had enough of this i am leaving
who warned you
goering because hinkel was working for goebbels
what did goering say
i wish to say something
go ahead be my guest
maintain liberty humanity and justice
and when did you first learn that when you sent the telegram was that the surrender signal the waving of the white flag
what telegram
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal adolf hider
i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings
think carefully wilhelm maybe not in your own name but as privy councillor or vice president
i do not have to think carefully this is utterly ridiculous
tell me about von der null
von der null
yes von der null
von der null
and what did he say
he said do not mind him his job is to criticise your job is to conduct
and what happened to von der nul
i have no idea
you have really no idea i will tell you what happened he died in stalingrad
i am sorry
you like the women do not you wilhelm
no i am not going to stop it hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter
i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter
i do not understand what you mean
no that is your problem wilhelm you understand nothing we will call you go
i believe that but just answer the question do not give me explanations
speaking to party members i used their language of course i did everyone did
of course i know what that is
okay so what is it
bruckner s seventh the adagio
who s conducting
it means i was not good enough to be a first violinist
me never never
i will ask the questions helmuth
excuse me did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience
do you know hans hinkel
do i know hans hinkel
that is what i asked
do i know hans hinkel
you seem to understand the question now how about answering it
hans hinkel was in the ministry of culture how could i know such a man i
do you know that is in this archive
how could i know that is in the archive
love em helmuth i give up what are you holding in your hand
the one he kept in his right hand yes you remember
yes you remember
how could i forget
show you
do it helmuth
exactly replaces the baton gives steve the case
do not worry helmuth it will be our secret
so you wanted to see me
all in the cause of humanity helmuth or should i call you one zero four nine three three one
you do not know what it is like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified you do not know that
major we are discussing a man of genius i do not want
of course you too like everyone else in this goddamn country
he did
one of your people told me
one of my people
son of a gun we will find the corporal and we will find the telegram
never heard of him who is he
edwin von der null music critic he gave furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan
who s he
yes yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name he he refers to him as k
his private life
yes dr furtwängler was absolutely clear about this politics and art must be kept separate
i do not know what you mean major
when you got to the crescendo
right claims assessor
conscientious determined dogged
they said i was dogged
first oboe
i have your questionnaire here it says you were never a member of the nazi party
absolutely not
hey hey slow up fraulein straube has to take down what you say
then how do you explain him being made a prussian privy councillor
it was beethoven s ninth
do you really think it was brave did not he bow to him and shake his hand
y yes
this road it leads straight to kuwait
turn the car around
please i beg of you the american army is there i am iraqi they will kill me
nobody s going to hurt you
not up to us up to the iraqis all they have to do is get out of kuwait
you know so much about the middle east you know where we can get something to eat
can you eat it if you cannot eat it i really do not care what it is
help i am being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory
there you go jaeger just find the buried treasure and you are a millionaire
damn this is sweet we are going to be home in no time
better grab up some sand to take home to your family
oh god
no please not again
we are going to keep driving
we should not have been here epps there is a war going on
this is miles from the battle lines they were probably deserters
deserters would have run they would not have engaged
they should not have been out this way that is all i am saying
low on gas got to refill
him getting us stranded out here does not do much good either
he is not so
he is an idiot and he is not nearly as hard as he thinks
how tough you have to be to make the army all you have got to do is shoot a gun and stop a bullet
i do not know and i was not about to mess with it
should have blown already delayed fuse that is vietnam stuff
for climbing
break it out
you just go when i say go
should have at least gotten the map off of him blows up with him then we did all this for nothing
the soldiers are going to kill those people
we can fight that is what we are here for to fight the iraqis to help the shi ites and the khurds
there s nothing we can do we should not even be here in the first place
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here worn down to nothing now
picks up again just on the other side
let me see the map
what do you figure it to be
got to be some kind of landmark something distinctive
basically but the map has been pretty precise so far i do not think it will be too hard to
i do not know there s a lot of space up here they could be just about
weird they did not chase us
so we wait
got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up does not hurt to have a look out either
all right i will go up then you send up the gold and
what about the gold
what about it
maybe we should split it up now
we started this together and we are staying together so there s no point in splitting things up now
what if we get separated way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share
you have had your say wes now leave it
maybe you have got ideas of your own for the gold maybe you have already got things worked out
maybe i do
maybe i do not need your ideas maybe i can do better on my own
then get up and do something about it
he snuck in here thinking we were asleep only i was not sleeping would have slit our throats if i had not stopped him
get off him
i told you he tried to steal our gold he tried to kill us
i told you do not push me around
how is he going to want the gold he could not even know we had it
he he could have been watching us
you said he was a deserter
that is what he says he could be a spy or something
you do not know that
you do not know he is not
he is an enemy soldier
i am not going to let you kill him
we are at war
he tried to kill us if not just now then in the helicopter that is all the authority i need
it is a combat action
it is murder and i will not be any part of it
then step aside
i out rank you that is why
what if i do
lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge
and let me guess who is
suppose i do not go for that
then i suppose it would be insurrection and i suppose i would have to kill you i suppose
what about jaeger
nothing about him unless he is got a problem about me dealing with you
sure and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with
tell me something wes are you crazy greedy or just stupid jaeger says you are crazy
that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert
you do not know john epps very well do you
i have to answer him
so you can give us away
if i do not answer he will know something s up
if i give it to you will you let us go
what are you doing
what does it look like i am doing i am killing iraqis at at at at at at at at at
knock it off
do not get pissed at me just cause i want to be ready when this war starts
ready for what what are you supposed to be doing
i told you i am shooting iraqis
no you are not
blow me
another month in this desert and i might just
blow me have i said that to you guys recently blow me
there might be something in there
yeah the deed to the brooklyn bridge
there might be
oh my god
i did it i got the box open
everybody s got a job to do figure it this way at least you get to go home alive
i would like to go home alive with a couple of iraqi scalps hanging from my belt
wait wait
christ wes tell him you know this stuff
we disappear for awhile we disappear we came back nobody knows nothing
but we all got to be in for this we all go or we do nothing
we go we get rich we go home it is that easy

yeah yeah she is fine
let s go
i know i know but i am saying if they knew we are going to be millionaires man millionaires
millionaires man
i know
and you missed this how are you going to miss something like this
i did not miss it i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you would want to turn back
we leave it
i got that sir
faster we get there faster we get back
yeah i know i am with you
do not drink up all of yours cause you are not getting any of ours
i am just going to have a little sip that is all just a sip
i heard it click
if you stepped on a mine you would be dead by now nobody uses delayed fuse mines anymore
i heard it
just be cool
it is a mine is not it
just relax
how m i gonna relax standing on a mine
we are going to get off all right we will get you off of there just be cool
me and wes are just going to talk
why you got to move away to talk
we are going to be right over here
you are moving away because it is going to blow up is not it it is going to blow up
i said be cool all right now be cool
epps my leg is falling asleep
it is not falling asleep you have only been standing there for three minutes
i am the one who can feel my leg and it is falling asleep
it falls asleep and you die so wake it the hell up
me and wes each going take an end of the rope run our asses of and yank you off the mine
that is going to do it right i am going to be okay
you are not going to let me die are you do not let me die
do not let me die epps i do not want to die
if we step on a mine we will know it was let me see the maps
it is the treasure that is what it is
just figure it is my map i ought to hang on to it
shut up and listen
it is a fire fight
single shots does not mean a fire fight that is not a battle going on
what are they doing here
what are they doing in the middle of nowhere
the shi ites are on our side i did not know that
so good bye shi ites thanks for playing we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go
something like that
but the white dot in the middle that is got to mean something
i hope it means something otherwise
stay low
where the hell is it
just stay down
we are not going to do anything
they are going to kill us
they cannot shoot us in here
if they land we can take them if they do not land then we have got nothing to worry about
right now i would not be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns
so where do we start
what does it look like i am doing
it looks like you are not doing anything
i am not and i am not doing anything because there s nothing down here
get up and dig
we have been digging we have been digging for hours if there was anything here to find we would have found it
get up off your ass and dig
i feel air probably opens up outside somewhere that is where the light comes from could not see it with the lanternon
it is giving
is it dead
yeah bwana you got it
i would not know i never imagined this not in my whole life did i ever imagine this
you do not have to imagine it not anymore now all you have got to think up is what it is going to buy you
he is not going to leave us
that is to stop him if he wanted to all he has to do is cut the line
jesus jaeger
i do not see how that plan s any better
someone s got to send the gold up it cannot get on the line by itself
yeah yeah that will work
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line it did not seem that long
not when you are up here with the gold i guess not
it stays as it is we are halfway home now let s not blow it by people getting ideas
northeast that is away from the hummer further into iraqi
we will find our way
forget wes
we cannot just leave him
wes is dead
what if he is not
they will ask questions want to know why we were out here
we will lie
they will search the pack
i am not like wes wes was crazy
and you you have got it all together
is it all right if i stand up
yeah well me too
i never killed anybody before i talk a good game but i am not like that
what yeah
makes two of us
i know what i did just now was crazy but you got to understand how much i want that gold
it is all right i do not like it but it is over now
it is got to be going better than this
you sure you want me too
okay then we go this way
it is a desert that is what deserts do at night they get cold
epps epps i am gonna stop for a second
we have got to keep moving while there s still light
you know what i am going to do i am just going to take a second i want to look at the gold
do not you touch it
i just want to look at it remind me of what i am dying for
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here
yeah but we made that deal while wes was still alive he is gone time for a new deal
place all alone like that must be a boarder check point
which boarder saudi kuwait syria
could not be syria we could not have gone that far north it is got to be saudi come on
epps what if they are not saudi
yeah i guess we should
i do not know something wes had taught me i think it means do not shoot we are your friends
they must be saudis it is a saudi checkpoint oh sweet jesus come on come on
they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them they could not tell in the dark
what are we going to do
and then what
and then shoot them
i i never killed anyone before i told you that
well you are going to start with a bang cause you have got four of them to take down
i do not have a weapon
i just said i would i do not think i
shoot them
i do not know he did not have a uniform on he he had on white robes like the guys who killed wes
we keep going that is what we do we ignore them maybe they ignore us
shi ites i think
is that good or bad
i do not know they killed wes
why have not they killed us
i do not know
maybe maybe we can fight our way out
with what against how many
we cannot just sit here waiting to die
you come up with a better plan let me know
maybe maybe if we traded them the gold if we gave it to them they might let us live they might not kill us
me i say you do not have enough brains to be stupid
no but i figure now s a real good time to start
we go this way
the the gold
it was not the gold it was the claymore mine the gold s in my pack
when did you make the switch
you should not think about things like that it will just make you crazy
how do we do that
somebody has to
yeah but why me what if the car does not stop
then i am a rich man
thought you were going to buy a car
still am there s more gold than i thought and since there s only two of us now where should i go
i do not know
i have never been anywhere i would not know where to go where would you go
how the hell should i know
we will make up some kind of lie they will not find the gold
he will slow down
he is going to slow down
i am looking for a favor i need a map of iraqi
i could use some recon photos too
just want to be ready when we do
ready for what sight seeing
the photos
they are all good ones satellites we have got can snap a shot of the boil on saddam s ass
saddam s got a boil on his ass
a headache
yeah a headache my head hurts you are making me uncomfortable
people were suffering in afganistan and we did not do anything
i am saying do not do it accidently
oh yeah accidently
it was an accident you saw it was an accident
i am just trying to help you guys out it does not hurt to know something about saudi arabia
i thought it would be good to know
do not shoot me i am friendly you can use that when you surrender
how do you say come here baby i am horny i can use that now
do not even try it you offend a woman out here you are in serious trouble
now you need me
what is it you know so much about arabland tell me what it is
yeah you are funny
it is a puzzle box if you can figure out how to open it there s supposed to be a treasure inside
for real a treasure
i could
naw nothing
you will you will get it
i will show epps he will be sorry when i get this thing open
you really think there s a treasure inside
yeah so
that is in two days
like i said so
they are cancelling all leaves all passes no more drills we stand at full ready starting
that is your point wes you have a point
we are going to war are not we if they are doing all that it must mean we are going to war
it does not mean anything
why would they do all that if we were not
come on man i almost had this thing open
you ever think about it you ever worry
this is so weird it is happening but it is not it is like a tv show and we are part of it
at at at at at
you know what wes if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war
it is a container break the seal
those soldiers have got loafers on what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers
it is right here this region an nagaf i got recon photos there are no troops there no fighting
you do not know where the iraqis have moved to and our forces have not even engaged the republican guard yet we do not know
it is about a hundred miles from where we are now how long do you think it would take us to
you know it is real you know it is real and you know it is there you know it
you are insane if you think you will find anything and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive
hell we will just buy our way out
oh no
if if there s a treasure
yeah if whatever what kind you figure it is
i do not know it would be small easy to transport and hide gold or jewels probably gold
yeah gold how much
how the hell should i know how much
you know what i am doing with my half
two vehicles they are not supposed to be here
oh jesus
they are not i had the pictures they are not supposed to be here
i think i am going to throw up i am i am going to toss
you see that right by us they went right by you had them epps you called it
yeah well we are not
we got to get out of here
we are not going anywhere not until we get what we came for
we just about got killed you know what happened we just about got killed and you want to go on
i figured i figured you would turn back
then lets go back while we still can
as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway we are not that far we can make it
really what is that an order private
you have to go with us you cannot walk back
until we are out of the mine field is how long
have not found a mine for half a mile or more
that do not mean nothing iraqis could have just spread them out like that make us think we are in the clear
you want to crawl crawl
probably would have too if epps was not around to stop you
anytime you want to do something about it just let
i know you are a pussy i know that
funny you should say that while we are out looking for gold
you are the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad
i have got a new agenda now it is get rich the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all
we make it or we go back empty handed
just seems weird they did not chase us
lines up with the map and the photos
guess we know what the next stop is
yeah we are down
what do you see
i think we found something
he is a soldier he does not need a weapon he is got rocks he is got bare hands
he lived through that
all last night he could have been
i think he wants something to drink
i am not wasting my water on him
he would just slow us down and drink our water and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he would sell us out
you want to say some words
the white reflects the sun it keeps you cooler that is why they wear them
probably shot a few scattered the rest murderers
you actually got around to killing someone i am impressed i guess you are only half a bitch
there s no law as i know of to prevent it
there s no mirror
there s not
excuse me
do you know you have lovely hair even if you torment it in those braids
i like plaits
you are spoiling your pretty looks come here
i did like the music
i carried you up to your bed
a sin against what
speak when you are spoken to he likes his women quiet
she got away
it is as though he would trapped a real cuckoo inside
did not you know he made things
i did not know about the puppets it is a lot to take in all at once
home is where the heart is
i cannot go home because there s no home left
she will have to learn
what about school
get away from me
ah you should see the swan his masterpiece now walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell
go away
what did i do wrong
do what oh i see
you are only a young thing
you are not so old yourself
living with him put years on me
let me in
well yes all right but
ah come on now
i finished it off
you did what
he will be looking for another apprentice
i hope he does not pick on jonathon
can you move over a wee bit
almighty jove in the shape of a swan
i have got a present for you
h m
nothing you should not have given victoria that guinness
it was only a mouthful
do you think we should take her up to bed
did you now
surely she is older
what difference does that make
all the time
so did i
but then i had a brother and a sister left
so had i
everything is gone now
nothing is left but us
we are too young
i am not too young juliet was my age
juliet who
you are late for breakfast
sixteen well nearly sixteen
i wanted my leda to be a little girl leda and the swan see
it is all right finn
tried to cannot quite make the connection with that sucker though if i had a direct terminal
are you embezzling
embezzling is such an ugly word mister bailey no actually i am trying to get a legal brief together
i do not get it
you have not told him
oh my meanwhile kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and i am not seeing one dime
i still do not get why you are trying to break into the system
because somewhere in one of those memories is the evidence if i got in far enough i could reconstruct it
boy if we were inside i know how to forge us a group 6 access
hi flynn
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health
want one
uh got any cinnamon
i know i met him
and dillinger s instructions to divert them it is all there look even his home phone number when he logged on
oh that is beautiful you have got the goods
nah i decided i have had enough of video games to last me a good long time i feel like getting into some real life
frustrating i had tron almost ready to run and dillinger cut everybody with group 7 access out of the system
yeah pain in the neck you know i was all set
did he say why
flynn had access to you too i am not interested in talking about him
oh i wish you would forget about that it was all so long ago i have totally gotten over it
okay okay
i want to go to his place
you call that getting over it
i mean i want both of us to go
to warn him
of what
that dillinger s on to him
for being on to dillinger
i am certainly not
boy i sit up there grinding away all day and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun
yes but you have to go roundtrip and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance hah
well you have to expect some static computers are just machines after all they cannot think
they will start to soon enough
alan alan bailey
oh yes the algorithms on cloud seeding great piece of work how is it going
no it will run independently it can watchdog the mcp as well
ah sounds good well we should have you running again in a couple of days i hope
yesssss yes yes yes
no nyet negatory not on your tintype no way
oh anything else
oui da yessiree sure nuff you betcha
only yes and no you are a bit
for sure
where is your program will not it miss you
right on the money
another mouth to feed you do not by any chance know how to drive this crate
yes okay exactement
no nuh uh never in a million years
not a chance
so nice ship you got here that is our next move
it is our friend the boy detective he is nosing around again
he is still looking for that old file cannot you just appropriate it
i would if i could find it it is stashed somewhere off in the system out of my range meanwhile
meanwhile he might find it
i am afraid so i spotted him this time and kicked him out but he is getting trickier all the time
i think we would better shut off all access till we can find that file just to be safe
there s a 68 71 percent chance you are right
i am sorry
and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week
the pentagon
it should not be any harder than general motors was but now this is what i get for using humans
now wait a minute i wrote you
i have gotten 2 415 times smarter since then
what do you want with the pentagon
you would not want me to dig up flynn s file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times would you
you would not dare
so do as i tell you keep that tron program out of the system and get me those chinese language program i asked for
that mcp you know that is half the problem right
the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do i cannot sit and worry about every little user request that
user requests are what computers are for
doing our business is what computers are for look walter with all respect icom is not the business you started in your garage anymore
it can be arranged
i am sorry walt so much pressure lately you feel like going for a drink
thank you no i have some work to do assuming i can still log on
hmm a difficult proposition difficult proposition at best perhaps you have noticed we are not exactly packing them in these days
when you have been in the system as long as i have you hear many promises many reassurances many brave plans
alan one he calls me may i pass
all that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible
dumont where is yori where is flynn
they may be de rezzed on the carrier hurry
well is not it
the name of my user yeah but how
i uh i am a program from a user that knows alan
tanks coming back let s go
no good they might block off the old chip this way
you are alive
yeah i oops
i am sorry tron he is he did not make it
wrote the
it is time i levelled with you tron i am a well i am what you guys call a user
you wish man i have not had a second to think since i got down here i mean in here out here whatever
i hate to disappoint you pal most the time that is how it is for users too
stranger and stranger
all right thank god alan stayed awake at least
probably decided not to pursue us the sea of simulation is tricky lot of illusions rough navigating programs have a way of just disappearing here
not us i hope
not with this disk i am going to check on the beam connection yori you two can keep a watch out for grid bugs
how about you
aah i am fine little hung over is all
guess i took a wrong turn somewhere
a little over there the mountains of data and i think that is the silicon valley
that is wrong with that area
lousy utility companies they are the same wherever you go
it is too far
elementary physics a beam of energy can always be diverted ooh my head are we there yet mommy
almost i just have to adjust our course at the next junction i would better go check the instruments
let s get some power here
why what are you going to do
look just so i can tell my friends what this dream was about okay where am i
you are a guest of the master control program they are going to make you play video games
well great that is no sweat i play video games better than anybody
how about yourself
oh uh i do not remember too much
yeah but i am remembering all kinds of stuff like my user wants me to go after the mcp
the tower yes flynn have you remembered anything else about yourself like what sector you are from
well my home sector was called paramus
paramus wonder what those initials stand for probably program assist routine well it sounds like a lovely place
it grows on you
alan one
we are inside a recognizer you are crazy stealing a recognizer
are you kidding i think it is stealing us
come here
we have to talk
good luck you cannot even think in here
have you been sneaking into the icom system
whew you never were much for small talk she still leave her clothes all over the floor
touche honey yeah i have been doing a little hacking here which i have got every reason as you well know
boy i bet i know who s working late tonight
not much chance of that now the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it
swell i will log us both on and you can get your tron thing running
as long as we stay off the top floor dillinger will never know we have been in here
well just do not forget your old friends when you are rich and famous
are you kidding you guys will he running this joint by then
you are getting out of the business
we might be capturing some military programs soon that interest you
he is not any kind of program sark he is a user
you rather take your chances with me want me to slow down your power cycles for you
then pull yourself together get this clown trained i want him in the games until he dies playing
end of line
yes and now you have got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation
we will get them sir these things take time
i do not have time sark and neither do you end of line
another free program off line that is his user s posed to do
the users you really think they are still there
they would better be i do not want to bust outta this dump ang find nothing but a lot of cold circuits waiting for me
do it
we have to
i have to find out what alan wants that comes first
oh tron i knew you would escape they have never built circuit that could hold you
why is everything like this
it is a flat but wait a micro
i had to in the games
as long as it gets us out of here
then i owe you some thanks
power surge the transmission beam s too strong
we have to get off this beam
i cannot there s no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds
where is flynn
if i ever need surgery get me the heart of an arb like yurovich it is never been used happy holideals harold
they do not know that is going on
sell it all what the hell so i will only make ten million
please no thanks
