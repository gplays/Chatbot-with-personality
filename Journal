Data processing
optimising library with intel
    Looking for a way to have latest tensorflow in conda env

careful tile batch beamsearch with ustom function (because of attention)
sequence_length (in dynamic_rnn) for no padding
parallel_iterations (dynaminc_rnn) for trade off Memory/speed
swap_memory (for swapping to cpu)
length penalty : [(5+sequence_lengths)/6]**penalty_factor (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144)

Use other tokenizer? https://github.com/google/sentencepiece
